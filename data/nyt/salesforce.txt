Full text: When it comes to remote work, executives want workers to do as they say, not as they do.
Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, once said, "I don't work well in an office." Which makes one wonder where he was when Salesforce's employees were ordered to return to the office three or more days a week. Perhaps he was sequestered at his properties in the genteel upcountry of Hawaii's Waimea district. Or maybe at his oceanfront estate, just down the hill.
In late October, Starbucks -- under its newly minted leader, Brian Niccol -- warned the coffee company's corporate employees that they must also return to the office three days a week by January. Yet Mr. Niccol continues to make his primary home in sunny Newport Beach, Calif. Starbucks has provided him with dedicated office space, a local personal assistant and a corporate jet ready to fly him the 1,000 miles to and from the company's world headquarters in Seattle. A company representative told CNBC that Mr. Niccol will be held to the same three days a week standard.
When the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020, many of America's office workers were suddenly able to work from home, introducing previously unimagined flexibility. They could move to more affordable locales, apply for jobs regardless of location and balance the demands of work and family. This privileged perk, however, opened a divide, as many essential workers still had to report to their stations.
Now growing numbers of the white-collar class are under increasing pressure to return, while many corner offices sit empty. The ability to work from home was always economically stratified. Now it is often being reserved for the wealthiest among us.
Research by the Stanford University economist and remote work expert Nick Bloom shows that postpandemic, the number of days people are allowed to work from home correlates to their income. Work-from-home days have fallen by 16 percent for workers earning $ 10,000 to $ 100,000 a year but only by 5 percent for those making $ 200,000 or more.
Perhaps that's why Mr. Bloom found a correlation between income earned and distance from the office. Only 5 percent of employees earning $ 10,000 to $ 50,000 a year work 50 or more miles from their company headquarters, compared with 14 percent earning more than $ 250,000. The gap is growing despite research that concludes that working from home can benefit employees and employers alike. He found that the practice improves gender mix by increasing the number of women in the work force, expands the labor supply in an otherwise tight market, improves the disability employment gap and supports families and home life. As one LinkedIn poster put it, replying to Mr. Bloom, "Isn't it amazing what the ability to put in a load of laundry during the workday can do for overall happiness."
Studies of call centers in China and Turkey that measured fully remote versus on-premise employment found that remote employees had higher performance metrics, including taking fewer sick days and processing more calls.
It seems that companies are ignoring the data. Amazon, a former employer of mine, prides itself on a data-driven culture that asks employees to be "skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ." And yet, to support its new edict that employees must return to the office five days a week by the start of the new year, the company issued a letter that had a conspicuous lack of such data. Instead, Amazon Web Services' chief, Matt Garman, in an all-staff meeting for the division, reportedly leaned on phrases like "I feel" and "we believe." For a company that values data so highly, the top brass sure are in their feelings.
If the C-suites are not being driven by data, what is driving them? Studies presented at Stanford University's October 2024 Remote Work Conference analyzed over 1,200 companies with return-to-office policies, and they found that such orders were more likely to be delivered after a poor financial performance. This suggests the office mania is less about improving company operations and more about reassuring shareholders that leadership means business. Given that those orders also upset longstanding workers to the point of quitting, perhaps they're also a cloaked way to reduce head count.
The shift from back to the office is not only ungrounded in research; it is also damaging, particularly for people with disabilities and for caregivers. During the pandemic, employment for workers with a disability rose by 22 percent. The economist and Nobel laureate Claudia Goldin noted in her 2024 Nobel lecture that creating virtual jobs that are akin to their in-office counterparts brightens the professional prospects for caregivers, especially women. Caregivers and people with disabilities shouldn't have to settle for lower-paid or less desirable roles.
Having worked for Amazon and Starbucks, I've heard the frustration from former colleagues facing child-care challenges, grueling commutes and moves across the country. It seems particularly cruel to be hired into a role advertised as fully remote and then told to "return" to an office that's not even in the same state.
This divide is evident in vacation locales such as Big Sky, Mont., and Aspen and Telluride, Colo., where the rich and remote have exacerbated a wealth gap and an affordable housing crisis and have changed the character of the country. While epic ski slopes beckon the C-suite, service workers drive from increasing distances to steam lattes and shovel snow. As these towns devolve into the patricians and the plebeians, it's as though American society is becoming ancient Rome.
Calls for workers to return to the office while company leaders stay remote are particularly tough to swallow, given research showing that it's the C-suite that is more ineffective from afar -- not the rank and file. Ran Duchin of Boston College and Denis Sosyura of Arizona State University tracked over 900 long-distance chief executives and found that they underperform compared with their on-premise counterparts. The greater the distance between the C.E.O.'s home and the company's headquarters, the greater the performance gap.
And using a jet to quickly close literal distances only widens a class gap.

SoftBank Pledges Big Investment On Heels of Trump Victory. Again.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The technology company plans to invest $ 100 billion in U.S. projects, echoing the multibillion-dollar pledge it made after Donald J. Trump's first election victory in 2016.
President-elect Donald J. Trump's first news conference since the election covered a wide range of topics, but it began with an eye-catching pledge: a $ 100 billion investment in the United States by SoftBank, a Japanese technology company.
Standing beside SoftBank's chief executive, Masayoshi Son, at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Monday, Mr. Trump announced a pledge that echoed a $ 50 billion commitment SoftBank made after his victory in 2016. That promise was followed by investments in a host of fledgling start-ups -- some that surged and others that ran into trouble, including the co-working company WeWork and Zume, a company that used robots to make pizza.
According to Mr. Trump, SoftBank's investment is intended to create 100,000 jobs. Trump transition officials said the investment would focus on technology and artificial intelligence over the next four years.
At the news conference, Mr. Trump immediately put the SoftBank chief on the spot, asking him to double the commitment. "He can actually afford to do that," Mr. Trump said. Mr. Son was noncommittal but called the president-elect a great negotiator.
SoftBank doesn't have $ 100 billion in cash on hand. The money is expected to come partly from its balance sheet but also from money raised alongside partners, according to a person familiar with SoftBank's plans.
Mr. Son, 67, started SoftBank in Tokyo in 1981 and has built it into one of the largest technology investors in the world. His firm has been known for its high-profile wins and losses, and Mr. Son -- commonly known as Masa -- has been known to grab headlines with eye-popping pronouncements, fund-raising and investments.
In December 2016, before Mr. Trump took office for the first time, Mr. Son promised a $ 50 billion investment in the United States, and said it would create 50,000 jobs. That announcement came shortly after Mr. Son had announced plans for SoftBank's Vision Fund, a $ 100 billion vehicle for investing in technology companies worldwide. Half of that $ 100 billion came from Saudi Arabia.
Through that fund, Mr. Son became one of the largest backers of tech start-ups, including Uber and DoorDash.
It is unclear how many jobs SoftBank created with its investments after the 2016 pledge, which had prompted Mr. Trump to write on social media: "Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!"
More recently, SoftBank has had a big winner in the chip design firm Arm, which is a key investment in its portfolio. SoftBank took the company public in September 2023, and its stock has since nearly tripled. Arm is poised to give the firm a key role in the rise of artificial intelligence.
SoftBank also recently invested $ 500 million in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and is looking to put another $ 1.5 billion into the company by buying employees' shares, a person familiar with the matter said.
The investment announced Monday is likely to be focused on the infrastructure needed to support the A.I. boom via energy projects, data centers and chips, according to a person familiar with the company's plans.
At SoftBank's annual meeting in June 2023, Mr. Son said he had a revelation that he wanted to spend the remainder of his life and career as "an architect to build the future of humankind" through A.I.
Alongside Mr. Son, some of the other biggest names in tech have recently brandished money and compliments for the president-elect, as well as made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to publicly show their support. Amazon, Meta and OpenAI's Sam Altman each donated $ 1 million to Mr. Trump's inaugural committee. Sundar Pichai and Sergey Brin of Google dined with Mr. Trump on Thursday, and Apple's Tim Cook shared a meal with him the next day.
Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce and the owner of Time magazine, last week posted on X that it was "a time of great promise for our nation." Time had awarded Mr. Trump its coveted "Person of the Year" designation, which the president-elect celebrated by ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.

The Great Capitulation: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, Donald Trump described recent visits from Tim Cook, C.E.O. of Apple, Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, and other tech barons. "In the first term, everyone was fighting me," he said. "In this term, everyone wants to be my friend." For once, he wasn't exaggerating.
Since Trump won re-election -- this time with the popular vote -- many of the most influential people in America seem to have lost any will to stand up to him as he goes about transforming America into the sort of authoritarian oligarchy he admires. Call it the Great Capitulation.
Following Jan. 6, Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook co-founder, suspended Trump's account. But last month at Mar-a-Lago, The Wall Street Journal reported, Zuckerberg stood, hand on heart, as "the club played a rendition of the national anthem sung by imprisoned" Jan. 6 defendants. (It's not clear if Zuckerberg knew what he was listening to.) He's pledged a million-dollar donation to Trump's inauguration, as did the OpenAI C.E.O. Sam Altman and Jeff Bezos' company Amazon, which will also stream the inauguration on its video platform.
After Time magazine declared Trump "Person of the Year," the publication's owner, the Salesforce C.E.O. Marc Benioff, wrote on X, "This marks a time of great promise for our nation." The owner of The L.A. Times, the billionaire pharmaceutical and biomedical entrepreneur Patrick Soon-Shiong, killed an editorial criticizing Trump's cabinet picks and urging the Senate not to allow recess appointments.
Most shocking of all, last week ABC News, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, made the craven decision to settle a flimsy defamation case brought by Trump.
As you may remember, a jury last year found Trump civilly liable for sexually abusing the writer E. Jean Carroll. In a memorandum, the judge in the case explained that while a jury didn't find that Trump had raped Carroll, it was operating under New York criminal law, which defines rape solely as "vaginal penetration by a penis." It did find that he'd forcibly penetrated her with his fingers.
"The finding that Ms. Carroll failed to prove that she was 'raped' within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump 'raped' her as many people commonly understand the word 'rape,"' wrote the judge. "Indeed, as the evidence at trial recounted below makes clear, the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that."
The ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos appeared to be using this broader definition when, in March, he said on-air that a jury had found Trump "liable for rape." Trump, who regularly threatens, and sometimes files, defamation cases against his perceived enemies in the press, sued. And though his case seemed absurdly weak, ABC News decided to settle in exchange for a $ 15 million donation to Trump's future presidential library or museum, $ 1 million in legal fees and a public statement of regret from Stephanopoulos and the network.
Displays of submission aren't limited to tech and media. Christopher Wray, the head of the F.B.I., agreed to step aside before the end of his 10-year term rather than make Trump fire him. Several Democrats have signaled their willingness to work with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, whose so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, seems poised to hack away at our already threadbare safety net.
In The New Yorker, Jonathan Blitzer wrote of the current administration's refusal, at least so far, to renew the humanitarian parole of immigrants from countries such as Venezuela and Haiti to possibly shield them from deportation under Trump. "For a president who considers Trump a fascist and has warned about the horrors of mass deportation, the atmosphere of Biden's White House has struck several people I spoke with as curiously sedate," Blitzer wrote.
Different people have different reasons for falling in line. Some may simply lack the stomach for a fight or feel, not unreasonably, that it's futile. Our tech overlords, however liberal they once appeared, seem to welcome the new order. Many hated wokeness, resented the demands of newly uppity employees and chafed at attempts by Joe Biden's administration to regulate crypto and A.I., two industries with the potential to cause deep and lasting social harm. There are C.E.O.s who got where they are by riding the zeitgeist; they can pivot easily from mouthing platitudes about racial equity to slapping on a red MAGA hat.
Some Democrats appear to think that they might steer DOGE in a productive direction and that, regardless, they'll get credit for bipartisanship. The electorate, after all, has rendered its verdict on #Resistance.
One of Kamala Harris's pollsters, Politico reported, recently warned the Democratic National Committee leadership against pearl-clutching over Trump's transgressions, including the wildly unfit characters he's announced for his administration. The voters, she said, "don't care about who he's putting in cabinet positions."
Collectively, all these elite decisions to bow to Trump make it feel like the air is going out of the old liberal order. In its place will be something more ruthless and Nietzschean.
"The individual has the intrinsic moral right to live his life in a special and fulfilling way without subordinating to the universal collective," Marc Andreessen, the software engineer and venture capitalist at the forefront of Silicon Valley's rightward lurch, wrote on X last week. "Purveyors of abstract guilt must not steal that from you." Even powerful people who didn't vote in favor of this harsh new world can find their consolations in it.

Tech Titans Recognize Trump Reality, and Rush to Curry Favor: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It was a week of frenzied activity, as Silicon Valley billionaires and their companies brandished checks and compliments for the President-elect.
The $ 1 million donations came gradually -- and then all at once.
Meta. Amazon. OpenAI's Sam Altman. Each of these Silicon Valley companies or their leaders promised to support President-elect Donald J. Trump's inaugural committee with seven-figure checks over the past week, often accompanied by a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to bend the knee.
The procession of tech leaders who traveled to hobnob with Mr. Trump face-to-face included Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, and Sergey Brin, a Google founder, who together dined with Mr. Trump on Thursday. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, shared a meal with Mr. Trump on Friday. And Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, planned to meet with Mr. Trump in the next few days.
This was the week when many tech companies and their top executives, as reluctant as they may have been, acknowledged the reality of getting business done in Mr. Trump's Washington. With their donations, visits and comments, they joined a party that has already raged for a month, as a cohort of influential Silicon Valley billionaires, led by Elon Musk, began running parts of Mr. Trump's transition after endorsing him in the campaign.
While businesses frequently try to get on an incoming president's good side, the frenzy of tech activity stood out from other industries. Until President Obama's administration, the tech industry had largely stayed aloof from politics. Some wrote just small checks for Mr. Trump's first inauguration.
Now the bread-breaking with Mr. Trump has become highly public. Meta and Amazon, whose founders had previously been criticized by Mr. Trump, said they would donate $ 1 million to Mr. Trump's inaugural fund this week. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, the high-profile artificial intelligence start-up, said on Friday that a $ 1 million donation to Mr. Trump's inaugural fund would come from him personally.
"President Trump will lead our country into the age of A.I., and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead," Mr. Altman said in a statement.
Nonprofit contributions to inaugural committees, which host patriotic-themed events around Jan. 20, are low-stakes, timeworn ways for companies to seek favor under the guise of patriotism without being pegged as overly partisan actors.
Other tech leaders have also praised Mr. Trump. Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce and the owner of Time Magazine, posted on X on Thursday that it was "a time of great promise for our nation," after Time awarded Mr. Trump its coveted "Person of the Year" designation.
"We look forward to working together to advance American success and prosperity for everyone," Mr. Benioff wrote, alongside a picture of the Time cover of Mr. Trump.
The turnabout has been especially stark as some tech executives who made donation pledges or met with Mr. Trump this week had appeared to be avowed liberals. That included Mr. Benioff and Mr. Altman, who were among the most politically active Democratic tech donors during Mr. Trump's first term. Mr. Brin publicly protested an immigration order from Mr. Trump in 2017.
In a statement, Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said, "President Trump has built the broadest political movement in history fueled by working-class Americans who are being joined by leaders from Silicon Valley to Wall Street. He's not even in the White House yet and President Trump is already uniting all Americans through success."
(The New York Times has sued OpenAI, saying the start-up infringed on its copyright in training A.I. systems.)
The latest moves brought the tech industry's backing of Mr. Trump to an even greater critical mass, as his early tech supporters spoke out about their giddiness for the incoming administration.
Marc Andreessen, an influential Silicon Valley venture capitalist who endorsed Mr. Trump during the campaign, said in a podcast interview this week that he had spent about half of his time since Election Day working on the presidential transition. He framed Mr. Trump's win as a cultural moment for a "techno-optimist" ideology.
"It's morning in America, so I'm very happy," Mr. Andreessen said. "People are finally poking their heads out of the frozen tundra of the culture and realizing that it's actually OK to build things, hire on merit, celebrate success, and fundamentally be proud of the country and be patriotic."
Mr. Andreessen has joined tech executives such as Mark Pincus, who founded the gaming company Zynga, and David Marcus, a former Meta executive, at Mar-a-Lago to help staff the new administration and to work on reducing regulations in industries like A.I. and cryptocurrencies.
Peter Thiel, a tech investor who was involved in Mr. Trump's 2016 transition but has been less involved this time, said in an interview that aired this week that his expectations were "properly intermediate" for Mr. Trump's performance. Even so, Mr. Thiel said, it was an epochal moment.
The "ancien régime that is liberalism is really exhausted," Mr. Thiel told Piers Morgan in the interview, in a reference to the political and social system in France before the French Revolution.
Exactly eight years ago, Mr. Thiel organized the parallel to the latest tech pilgrimages -- a selective get-together at Trump Tower of tech titans and Mr. Trump. At the time, attendees expressed a similar optimism, which evaporated when Mr. Trump pushed policies on climate and immigration early in his term that repelled tech leaders.
Some signs of tension between Mr. Trump and the tech industry have already surfaced this time. Mr. Trump has named tech hawks to senior administration roles, as well as tech executives such as David Sacks, an investor and podcaster who has been appointed "czar" of crypto and A.I.
Part of Mr. Sacks's job is to assemble a council to advise Mr. Trump, who has pronounced himself a crypto believer, on crypto and A.I. But Mr. Trump's circle of advisers and his tech friends have disagreed over whether there should be two separate advisory bodies or just one, people involved in the conversations said.
Those in the cryptocurrency and A.I. fields have largely pushed for two different councils, one person said, adding that there had also been some dispute over who would choose those who serve on the councils. People who donated to support Mr. Trump are likely to gain preference in receiving positions on the councils, the people said.
Many cryptocurrency and A.I. executives have also visited Mar-a-Lago or talked with Mr. Trump or those close to him. Among them is Daniel Gross, an A.I. executive, who recently visited Mar-a-Lago, according to a social-media post from him.
Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of MicroStrategy, a publicly traded software firm that owns tens of billions of dollars of Bitcoin, said in an interview this week that he would be "happy to volunteer my services" to the crypto advisory council. And Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, spoke privately with Mr. Trump last month, two people with knowledge of the matter said. (Coinbase said in a statement that it planned to work with Republicans and Democrats.)
Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive of the crypto company Ripple, said he also visited Mar-a-Lago recently to talk about crypto. Not to be outdone, Ripple plans to donate $ 5 million in XRP, its own digital currency, to Mr. Trump's inaugural fund, he said.

Full text: Whether on Prince William, JD Vance or Jacob Elordi, facial hair gets people talking.
As far as beards go, his is more measly than grizzly.
For the past several months, Prince William, the shiny-headed British royal, has been fostering a modest bit of scruff. The heir to the British throne debuted the beard in August, with an Instagram post congratulating Team Britain on their success at the Olympics. At that time the growth was slight, as if he had forgotten his razor over a long weekend, the strands barely connecting with his sideburns.
That version of the Prince's patchy beard didn't last. As he told People magazine in November, he shaved at the behest of his daughter, Princess Charlotte, who was reported to have fallen into "floods of tears" at the sight of her father's new look.
But this past week the beard was back -- fuller, if only just so -- as Prince William served Christmas lunch at a charity organization in London and attended the reopening of Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris over the weekend.
At the latter event, the Prince's appearance received high marks from at least one world leader. "He's a good looking guy. He looked really, very handsome last night," President-elect Donald J. Trump told the New York Post.
That publication's gossip arm, Page Six, referred to the beard as "rugged," though that's likely overselling the Prince's subdued scruff.
"It's just there," said Alun Withey, a senior lecturer of history at the University of Exeter and the author of "Concerning Beards: Facial Hair, Health and Practice in England, 1650-1900." "It's not cut into any style."
As to why the royal would be compelled to grow a beard at all, Allan Peterkin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto and the author of "One Thousand Beards: A Cultural History of Facial Hair," offered that Prince William finds himself at an inflection point in both his personal life and his royal trajectory.
"He's just putting a strong masculine face forward," said Dr. Peterkin, who assessed the fledgling beard to be "a wee bit scruffy."
Prince William, 42, is a father of three and is next in line to the British throne. The beard could thus be a tool to help him appear more distinguished and blur the public perception of him as a rosy-cheeked child clutching his mother's hand.
"He's saying, I am stepping into to my full role as a man, and maybe I don't want you thinking so much of my little boy face," Dr. Peterkin said. "What you see is a fully grown, mature man ready to wear the crown."
Dr. Withey offered that Prince William "is not doing anything particularly unusual," as there is a long history of British monarchs growing beards.
In the early 20th century, King George V cultivated a curlicue mustache and bushy chops that could still make one of Brooklyn's $ 200-a-cut barbers weak at the knees. Decades later, Prince William's father, King Charles III, sported a robust, reddish beard in his 20s that made him appear like a young Jim Henson.
According to Prince Harry's 2023 memoir, "Spare," the younger royal's conspicuous beard ignited a rift between the brothers. Prince Harry, the book recalls, was given permission to keep his fiery scruff for his 2018 royal wedding to Meghan Markle.
"Maybe it was Freudian -- beard as security blanket. Maybe it was Jungian -- beard as mask," Prince Harry wrote. "Whatever, it made me calmer, and I wanted to feel as calm as possible on the day of my wedding."
If the beard soothed Prince Harry, it ruffled his brother. Per the book, the elder royal "became livid," as he had previously been told that he was not allowed to keep his own beard. The book did not specify who demanded the beard be shorn.
The beard may have stoked a battle between brothers, but beyond the grounds of Windsor Castle facial hair is no longer the cultural signifier that it once was.
"Many men his age across the Western world wear beards, so it's a norm for his age cohort," Dr. Peterkin said of Prince William. Beards are neither an offramp from polite society as it was for hippies in the '60s, nor a knowing flourish of pretentious hipsterdom as it was in the aughts.
Today, the beard is banal. LeBron James has one, as does George Clooney and Jimmy Kimmel. David Letterman's Father Time retirement beard is entering its second decade of existence. Even executives can forgo their razors without fear of being ousted by their boards. The salt-and-pepper beard of Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and the slight scruff of Salesforce's chief executive, Marc Benioff, are striking, though less so than the Rasputin shock that Jack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder, has cultivated.
Beards have even outlasted being a political penalty. In some ways, the rising face of America's Republican Party is a bearded one. The incoming vice president, JD Vance, with his well-manicured sweep of a beard, was the first major party nominee to have facial hair in 75 years. Given Mr. Vance's tendency to make outrageous claims on the campaign trail, including that immigrants were eating pets, his facial hair was the least of what voters had to tangle with. Similarly, both Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. sport beards worthy of the term rugged.
If the beard has any power left to shock -- or at least provide fodder for social media scrutiny -- it's when it first sprouts. Earlier this month, Jacob Elordi, the squeaky cleanshaven star of "Priscilla," surfaced at a film festival with a fresh chin-cloaking beard. He looked like a bank robber on the lam, or the drummer of a stomp-clap folk-rock band. The internet seemed to agree that the 27-year-old Australian actor was doing himself a disservice by hiding his good looks behind the beard.
Still, for both Mr. Elordi and Prince William, it's perhaps less the beard itself that people are reacting to than these public figures not looking how the public is accustomed to seeing them. We're reacting to the shock of the new, not to the shock of the scruff.
"Beards are commonplace and normal, but we still talk about it when somebody famous decides to radically change their face and grow one," Dr. Peterkin said.
If Prince William chooses to keep the beard, people will eventually get used to it. The royal could even, as Dr. Withey predicted, spark a trend for scraggly beards. "We'll give it a name," he said. "That would be the Prince William style of beard."

Minnows and Whales Vie for Venture Deals: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Three decades ago, five men formed a venture capital firm on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley with a simple pitch: Small is beautiful.
Their firm, Benchmark Capital, planned to stick to venture capital's traditional playbook. It would write tiny checks to invest in private technology companies and help them succeed with guidance and connections. It would resist the urge to become bigger over time. Benchmark's founders even quoted Voltaire: "God is not on the side of the big arsenals, but on the side of those who shoot best."
Fourteen years later, two entrepreneurs set up shop across the street with a very different plan. They established Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm that would do more of everything -- raise more money, do more deals, make more noise and flash more attitude. Ben Horowitz, one of the firm's founders, called his creation the "anti-Benchmark."
Since then, Andreessen Horowitz has expanded in every direction. It created funds focused on cryptocurrencies, defense and other tech, managing a total of $ 44 billion. It became a registered investment adviser, meaning it could own public stocks and cryptocurrencies. It hired 80 investment partners and opened five offices. It publishes eight newsletters and seven podcasts, and has more than 800 portfolio companies. It recently added private wealth management services. There are persistent rumors that it will go public.
Benchmark, on the other hand, has hardly budged. It still has five partners who make investments. This year, it raised a new $ 425 million fund, which is roughly the same size its funds have been since 2004. Its website is a single landing page.
The gap between the two firms -- one clinging to venture capital's traditional model and the other aggressively not -- underscores the profound divergence in the industry that funds and fosters American innovation. As venture capital grew and Sand Hill Road took on the same mythological proportions as Wall Street, many top venture firms followed Andreessen Horowitz's lead by supersizing. That propelled venture capital out of its longtime finance niche, turning it into a $ 1.2 trillion juggernaut last year, from $ 232 billion under management in 2009.
"The venture market has permanently changed," said Theresa Sorrentino Hajer, the head of venture capital research at Cambridge Associates, an investment firm that has backed venture funds since the late 1970s. "It's no longer a cottage industry by any stretch."
Those pushing venture capital's bigger-is-better strategy said their approach was simply the natural outgrowth of the industry's decades of success. Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon -- five of the world's most valuable public companies -- were all started with the help of venture money.
And as Marc Andreessen, an Andreessen Horowitz founder, predicted in a 2011 post, software ate the world. Tech has infiltrated every industry, creating infinite opportunities for start-up disruption. Now, bigger-is-better supporters say, even more money is needed to solve society's thorniest problems with innovation. Small funds, they scoff, can back only small ideas.
The growth has prompted frustration and fear about the delicate system of money, talent and ideas that makes Silicon Valley tick. Some worry that venture funds have become too big and the firms too bloated, with not enough good start-ups to invest in, which hurts returns. Smaller firms are struggling to compete against the big funds that can invest more, pay higher prices and more easily absorb losses.
"This is causing fundamental waves in the entire ecosystem," said Kyle Harrison, an investor at the venture firm Contrary. "I don't think enough people appreciate the negative aspects."
Some openly wonder whether there is still a place for boutique partnerships like Benchmark in an age of ever-expanding mega-firms like Andreessen Horowitz. It has raised the question: What even is venture capital anymore?
A $ 6.7 Million Bet on eBay
The venture playbook was created in the late 1950s when Arthur Rock, an investor, persuaded disgruntled employees of the pioneering chip company Shockley Semiconductor to defect and form their own start-up. He took a minority ownership stake in their new company, Fairchild Semiconductor, and incentivized the employees with shares. Within two years, Fairchild minted a return of 600 times its investment.
Mr. Rock's success induced others to look for the next new thing. Investment firms clustered among the fruit orchards of Santa Clara County, Calif., on Sand Hill Road. Some, such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Sequoia Capital, became known as kingmakers that provided expertise, connections and, of course, money to help risky start-ups become the next Apple, Microsoft, Xerox and Google.
In 1995, Benchmark opened on Sand Hill Road. Its partners, including Bruce Dunlevie and Andy Rachleff, were a group of energetic men in their 30s and early 40s, most of whom had gone to Stanford Business School and had worked at other venture firms.
They named their firm Benchmark after the industry standard for investment returns -- not after themselves, as was common -- and decided against having an army of analysts, associates and junior partners. Every partner got equal decision-making power and an equal cut of the profits.
Benchmark quickly catapulted into the industry's top tier by investing in eBay in 1997. Mr. Dunlevie persuaded Pierre Omidyar, eBay's founder, to take Benchmark's $ 6.7 million investment at a valuation of $ 20 million, even though it was lower than a competing bid. Within two years, that bet was worth more than $ 4 billion.
EBay was one of several venture-backed start-ups from that era that went on to become major players in the new internet economy, including PayPal, Amazon and Google. But many other bets failed, and the 2000 dot-com crash tarnished venture capital's reputation. Founders warned of soulless, bloodsucking "sweater vests" who would kick them out of their own companies to save their investments.
In 2009, Mr. Andreessen, a creator of the Mosaic Web browser and the co-founder of the internet browser company Netscape, and Mr. Horowitz, a fellow Netscape executive, started their venture firm. They had been so put off by their own experiences with venture capitalists at their other company, Opsware, that it inspired them to start their own operation, they said.
Their aim: to treat founders better. In a 2015 interview with The New Yorker, Mr. Horowitz singled out Benchmark and said, "Our design was to not do what they did."
With a Fortune cover story announcing its first $ 300 million fund, Andreessen Horowitz immediately stood out as a brash and boisterous presence in an industry that typically stayed behind the scenes. Mr. Andreessen and Mr. Horowitz gave hundreds of media interviews discussing their "founder-friendly" approach, which included hiring teams of professionals to help start-ups with public relations, sales and recruiting.
By 2011, they had amassed $ 2.7 billion and invested in companies such as Airbnb and Stripe. Mr. Horowitz marveled at his firm's success in a blog post and bragged about how popular it had become with founders.
Its growing muscle was evident in 2012, when top venture firms, including Benchmark and Sequoia Capital, battled to invest in GitHub, a fast-growing website for software developers. Andreessen Horowitz's entrepreneurial mind-set was striking, said Tom Preston-Werner, a GitHub founder and its chief executive.
Andreessen Horowitz also made the highest bid, offering to invest an eye-popping $ 100 million in GitHub at a $ 750 million valuation.
"They gave us everything we wanted," said Chris Wanstrath, a GitHub founder. The deal solidified Andreessen Horowitz's place as an aggressive disrupter. It also paid off: Six years later, GitHub sold to Microsoft for $ 7.5 billion.
Andreessen Horowitz's swagger bothered the industry. In a 2013 interview with Mr. Andreessen, Sarah Lacy, a tech journalist, observed that other investors had complained about him.
"You have forever eroded the comfortable margins of venture capital," she said.
"Aw, that is so sad," Mr. Andreessen joked. "I feel terrible! How will they afford their third vineyard?"
In a separate interview, Mr. Horowitz called investors who did not want to compete "the crybabies of Silicon Valley."
Those crybabies responded by copying Andreessen Horowitz. Many hired public relations firms and teams to help start-ups with recruiting, marketing, design and other services. They espoused founder-friendly views on social media. They raised bigger funds.
'You Make Money When We Make Money'
In contrast, Benchmark mostly stuck to its knitting. Over the years, Mr. Dunlevie and Benchmark's other founding partners groomed a new generation to take over as they retired, including Bill Gurley, a former equities analyst, and Peter Fenton, an investor who joined in 2006. They made a string of winning bets on Uber, Twitter, Yelp, Zillow and others.
Benchmark's first eight funds, which were raised and invested from 1995 to 2019, generated returns of more than 7.5 times the money invested, after deducting fees and profits taken by the fund, a person with knowledge of the firm said.
Mr. Gurley, a frequent blogger and commentator, often bemoaned the glut of capital sloshing around the industry. He warned that the easy money was causing start-ups to be reckless and spend too much, with no sign of making a profit or going public.
"This threatens returns for all involved," he wrote in 2016.
His warnings intensified when outsiders, including SoftBank's $ 100 billion Vision Fund and Tiger Global's fast-moving hedge fund, barreled into start-up investing with hoards of cash. But others, led by Andreessen Horowitz, saw an opportunity to further build their empires by raising larger funds. Venture firms typically charge a two percent annual fee on their funds and take 20 percent of the profits on investments. Bigger funds meant bigger fees.
In 2016, Eric Vishria, a tech entrepreneur who had joined Benchmark, beat out eight other investors to back Cerebras, a chip start-up. Benchmark's small fund had been a factor in the decision, said Andrew Feldman, Cerebras's chief executive. That way, he knew the investors were not getting rich on fees; they would profit only if Cerebras succeeded.
"You make money when we make money," Mr. Feldman said.
In 2019, Andreessen Horowitz registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission so that it could invest beyond private start-ups. The firm promoted its "massive ambition" to become the best investor in everything. At least 19 other venture firms have followed, including Sequoia, General Catalyst and Thrive Capital.
Behind the scenes, limited partners -- the pension funds, endowments and wealthy families that invest in venture funds -- started worrying that the bigger funds would not produce the same payoffs.
Smaller funds have typically earned higher returns, said Ms. Hajer of Cambridge Associates, but they have also had higher rates of losses. Bigger funds tend to have median returns but fewer losses, meaning they are safer bets with less upside. The ballooning billion-dollar funds could change venture capital's return profile.
"You don't invest in V.C. to get median returns," she said.
Beezer Clarkson, an investor at Sapphire Partners, which invests in venture funds below $ 1 billion, said her firm sought out funds that could earn at least three times their money.
"It's harder to see that when the funds get large," she said.
Is Small Really Beautiful?
By 2020, 16 venture firms had raised funds that were over $ 1 billion, according to PitchBook, which tracks start-ups, up from just three such funds five years earlier.
That same year, Andreessen Horowitz and Benchmark competed once again -- this time to invest in Clubhouse, an audio app that took off during the coronavirus pandemic. Benchmark already knew Paul Davison, Clubhouse's founder, who had worked as an "entrepreneur-in-residence"-- a program for founders to develop new ideas -- at the firm.
But Andreessen Horowitz won out after offering to invest in Clubhouse at a valuation of $ 100 million, roughly 20 percent higher than Benchmark's offer, a person with knowledge of the deal said. Andreessen Horowitz also pitched its wide range of services, even using its Hollywood connections to wrangle celebrities like the comedian Kevin Hart to join the app. (Forbes earlier reported on details of the Clubhouse investment.)
Benchmark's partners began asking themselves if their "small is beautiful" model still worked, two people with knowledge of the firm said. They debated the issue when Miles Grimshaw, a young investor, joined Benchmark in 2020 from the New York firm Thrive Capital, where he had made large investments in older start-ups.
Expanding would let Benchmark do bigger deals and back more companies. But it would also mean hiring more staff and managing and mentoring them. The partners would have to schmooze limited partners and create a marketing department. They would have to build a more robust website and attend meetings about what it would look like.
That would all distract from finding the best start-ups to invest in and helping them succeed. Most crucially, Benchmark's partners worried that a bigger fund would produce worse returns, the people with knowledge of the firm said.
Benchmark decided to stay the course.
"We're always asking that question," Mr. Vishria said in a 2023 podcast interview. "You always have to be questioning your assumptions and are you doing the right thing."
The question came up again a year later during a frenzy to invest in Silicon Valley start-ups. Clubhouse was so hot that it turned down an offer to sell to Twitter for $ 4 billion, two people familiar with the talks said. Andreessen Horowitz gave the company more money at the same price.
Benchmark's partners had the same conversation and again decided to stay small, two people said.
The strategy cost it a partner. This year, Mr. Grimshaw returned to Thrive Capital. Soon after, Thrive raised its largest fund of $ 5 billion. Through a representative, Mr. Grimshaw declined to comment.
Divergent Paths on Artificial Intelligence
Andreessen Horowitz's investment in Clubhouse turned out to be a dud. In 2022, during a tech downturn, Clubhouse's popularity waned as people returned to in-person socializing. By 2023, the start-up had laid off half its staff and was reworking its app.
As the downturn worsened, venture capitalists struggled to cash in on their investments. In 2022 and 2023, venture firms invested more money than they returned to their investors, reversing a decade-long streak, according to Cambridge Associates data.
The lack of returns made it harder for younger, smaller venture firms to raise funds. Yet the biggest firms were flush. Andreessen Horowitz amassed a $ 7.2 billion fund this April. Another firm, Iconiq Capital, raised $ 5.75 billion in May, while General Catalyst gathered $ 8 billion in October.
Much of the new money is being earmarked for tech's latest obsession: artificial intelligence. In that arena, the contrast between the two investment models is stark. Andreessen Horowitz has invested in roughly 86 A.I. companies, including OpenAI. Benchmark, whose five partners do one or two deals a year, has backed around 20.
Their differing strategies were on display with 11x.ai, a hot A.I. sales company. In April, Sarah Tavel, a Benchmark partner, beat out eight firms to lead a $ 24 million funding into the start-up. A blog post she had written about A.I. and sales had aligned with 11x.ai's plans, said Hasan Sukkar, the start-up's co-founder and chief executive.
Even before 11x.ai announced the funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz swooped in with more money. The Andreessen Horowitz team, which had their own blog post titled the "Death of Salesforce," led a $ 50 million funding, increasing 11x.ai's valuation by nearly four times in just a few months, according to Mr. Sukkar.
It's too soon to know whether the mega-funds will succeed, since venture funds typically take at least a decade to pay off. In the meantime, industry watchers see a future in which Andreessen Horowitz and its peers follow the private equity giants Blackstone Group and KKR by listing their shares on the public markets.
Andreessen Horowitz has told its limited partners that it does not plan to go public, a person with knowledge of the situation said. But it has made no secret of wanting to build a tech investing empire. Mr. Andreessen has long been inspired by John Pierpont Morgan, the founder of the eponymous finance giant, and for years kept an image of the banker hanging in his office in Menlo Park, Calif., said a person with knowledge of the firm.
Staying small is riskier as the profits have to come from the investments, not the fees. But Benchmark has no intention of changing.
"When it works," Mr. Vishria said, "it's really magical."

They named their firm Benchmark after the industry standard for investment returns — not after themselves, as was common — and decided against having an army of analysts, associates and junior partners. Every partner got equal decision-making power and an equal cut of the profits.
Benchmark quickly catapulted into the industry’s top tier by investing in eBay in 1997. Dunlevie persuaded Pierre Omidyar, eBay’s founder, to take Benchmark’s $6.7 million investment at a valuation of $20 million, even though it was lower than a competing bid. Within two years, that bet was worth more than $4 billion.
EBay was one of several venture-backed startups from that era that went on to become major players in the new internet economy, including PayPal, Amazon and Google. But many other bets failed, and the 2000 dot-com crash tarnished venture capital’s reputation. Founders warned of soulless, bloodsucking “sweater vests” who would kick them out of their own companies to save their investments.
In 2009, Andreessen, a creator of the Mosaic web browser and co-founder of the internet browser company Netscape, and Horowitz, a fellow Netscape executive, started their venture firm. They had been so put off by their own experiences with venture capitalists at their other company, Opsware, that it inspired them to start their own operation, they said.
Their aim: to treat founders better. In a 2015 interview with The New Yorker, Horowitz singled out Benchmark and said, “Our design was to not do what they did.”
With a Fortune cover story announcing its first $300 million fund, Andreessen Horowitz immediately stood out as a brash and boisterous presence in an industry that typically stayed behind the scenes. Andreessen and Horowitz gave hundreds of media interviews discussing their “founder-friendly” approach, which included hiring teams of professionals to help startups with public relations, sales and recruiting.
By 2011, they had amassed $2.7 billion and invested in companies such as Airbnb and Stripe. Horowitz marveled at his firm’s success in a blog post and bragged about how popular it had become with founders.
Its growing muscle was evident in 2012, when top venture firms, including Benchmark and Sequoia Capital, battled to invest in GitHub, a fast-growing website for software developers. Andreessen Horowitz’s entrepreneurial mindset was striking, said Tom Preston-Werner, a GitHub founder and its CEO.
Andreessen Horowitz also made the highest bid, offering to invest an eye-popping $100 million in GitHub at a $750 million valuation.
“They gave us everything we wanted,” said Chris Wanstrath, a GitHub founder. The deal solidified Andreessen Horowitz’s place as an aggressive disrupter. It also paid off: Six years later, GitHub sold to Microsoft for $7.5 billion.
Andreessen Horowitz’s swagger bothered the industry. In a 2013 interview with Andreessen, Sarah Lacy, a tech journalist, observed that other investors had complained about him.
“You have forever eroded the comfortable margins of venture capital,” she said.
“Aw, that is so sad,” Andreessen joked. “I feel terrible! How will they afford their third vineyard?”
In a separate interview, Horowitz called investors who did not want to compete “the crybabies of Silicon Valley.”
Those crybabies responded by copying Andreessen Horowitz. Many hired public relations firms and teams to help startups with recruiting, marketing, design and other services. They espoused founder-friendly views on social media. They raised bigger funds.
‘You Make Money When We Make Money’
In contrast, Benchmark mostly stuck to its knitting. Over the years, Dunlevie and Benchmark’s other founding partners groomed a new generation to take over as they retired, including Bill Gurley, a former equities analyst, and Peter Fenton, an investor who joined in 2006. They made a string of winning bets on Uber, Twitter, Yelp, Zillow and others.
Benchmark’s first eight funds, which were raised and invested from 1995 to 2019, generated returns of more than 7.5 times the money invested, after deducting fees and profits taken by the fund, a person with knowledge of the firm said.
Gurley, a frequent blogger and commentator, often bemoaned the glut of capital sloshing around the industry. He warned that the easy money was causing startups to be reckless and spend too much, with no sign of making a profit or going public.
“This threatens returns for all involved,” he wrote in 2016.
His warnings intensified when outsiders, including SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund and Tiger Global’s fast-moving hedge fund, barreled into startup investing with hoards of cash. But others, led by Andreessen Horowitz, saw an opportunity to further build their empires by raising larger funds. Venture firms typically charge a 2% annual fee on their funds and take 20% of the profits on investments. Bigger funds meant bigger fees.
In 2016, Eric Vishria, a tech entrepreneur who had joined Benchmark, beat out eight other investors to back Cerebras, a chip startup. Benchmark’s small fund had been a factor in the decision, said Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman. That way, he knew the investors were not getting rich on fees; they would profit only if Cerebras succeeded.
“You make money when we make money,” Feldman said.
In 2019, Andreessen Horowitz registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission so that it could invest beyond private startups. The firm promoted its “massive ambition” to become the best investor in everything. At least 19 other venture firms have followed, including Sequoia, General Catalyst and Thrive Capital.
Behind the scenes, limited partners — the pension funds, endowments and wealthy families that invest in venture funds — started worrying that the bigger funds would not produce the same payoffs.
Smaller funds have typically earned higher returns, said Hajer of Cambridge Associates, but they have also had higher rates of losses. Bigger funds tend to have median returns but fewer losses, meaning they are safer bets with less upside. The ballooning billion-dollar funds could change venture capital’s return profile.
“You don’t invest in VC to get median returns,” she said.
Beezer Clarkson, an investor at Sapphire Partners, which invests in venture funds below $1 billion, said her firm sought out funds that could earn at least three times their money.
“It’s harder to see that when the funds get large,” she said.
Is Small Really Beautiful?
By 2020, 16 venture firms had raised funds that were over $1 billion, according to PitchBook, which tracks startups, up from just three such funds five years earlier.
That same year, Andreessen Horowitz and Benchmark competed once again — this time to invest in Clubhouse, an audio app that took off during the coronavirus pandemic. Benchmark already knew Paul Davison, Clubhouse’s founder, who had worked as an “entrepreneur-in-residence”— a program for founders to develop new ideas — at the firm.
But Andreessen Horowitz won out after offering to invest in Clubhouse at a valuation of $100 million, roughly 20% higher than Benchmark’s offer, a person with knowledge of the deal said. Andreessen Horowitz also pitched its wide range of services, even using its Hollywood connections to wrangle celebrities such as comedian Kevin Hart to join the app. (Forbes earlier reported on details of the Clubhouse investment.)
Benchmark’s partners began asking themselves if their “small is beautiful” model still worked, two people with knowledge of the firm said. They debated the issue when Miles Grimshaw, a young investor, joined Benchmark in 2020 from New York firm Thrive Capital, where he had made large investments in older startups.
Expanding would let Benchmark do bigger deals and back more companies. But it would also mean hiring more staff and managing and mentoring them. The partners would have to schmooze limited partners and create a marketing department. They would have to build a more robust website and attend meetings about what it would look like.
That would all distract from finding the best startups to invest in and helping them succeed. Most crucially, Benchmark’s partners worried that a bigger fund would produce worse returns, the people with knowledge of the firm said.
Benchmark decided to stay the course.
“We’re always asking that question,” Vishria said in a 2023 podcast interview. “You always have to be questioning your assumptions and are you doing the right thing.”
The question came up again a year later during a frenzy to invest in Silicon Valley startups. Clubhouse was so hot that it turned down an offer to sell to Twitter for $4 billion, two people familiar with the talks said. Andreessen Horowitz gave the company more money at the same price.
Benchmark’s partners had the same conversation and again decided to stay small, two people said.
The strategy cost it a partner. This year, Grimshaw returned to Thrive Capital. Soon after, Thrive raised its largest fund of $5 billion. Through a representative, Grimshaw declined to comment.
Divergent Paths on Artificial Intelligence
Andreessen Horowitz’s investment in Clubhouse turned out to be a dud. In 2022, during a tech downturn, Clubhouse’s popularity waned as people returned to in-person socializing. By 2023, the startup had laid off half its staff and was reworking its app.
As the downturn worsened, venture capitalists struggled to cash in on their investments. In 2022 and 2023, venture firms invested more money than they returned to their investors, reversing a decade-long streak, according to Cambridge Associates data.
The lack of returns made it harder for younger, smaller venture firms to raise funds. Yet, the biggest firms were flush. Andreessen Horowitz amassed a $7.2 billion fund in April. Another firm, Iconiq Capital, raised $5.75 billion in May, while General Catalyst gathered $8 billion in October.
Much of the new money is being earmarked for tech’s latest obsession: artificial intelligence. In that arena, the contrast between the two investment models is stark. Andreessen Horowitz has invested in roughly 86 AI companies, including OpenAI. Benchmark, whose five partners do one or two deals a year, has backed about 20.
Their differing strategies were on display with 11x.ai, a hot AI sales company. In April, Sarah Tavel, a Benchmark partner, beat out eight firms to lead a $24 million funding into the startup. A blog post she had written about AI and sales had aligned with 11x.ai’s plans, said Hasan Sukkar, the startup’s co-founder and CEO.
Even before 11x.ai announced the funding from Benchmark, Andreessen Horowitz swooped in with more money. The Andreessen Horowitz team, which had their own blog post titled the “Death of Salesforce,” led a $50 million funding, increasing 11x.ai’s valuation by nearly four times in just a few months, according to Sukkar.
It’s too soon to know whether the megafunds will succeed, since venture funds typically take at least a decade to pay off. In the meantime, industry watchers see a future in which Andreessen Horowitz and its peers follow private equity giants Blackstone Group and KKR by listing their shares on the public markets.
Andreessen Horowitz has told its limited partners that it does not plan to go public, a person with knowledge of the situation said. But it has made no secret of wanting to build a tech investing empire. Andreessen has long been inspired by John Pierpont Morgan, founder of the eponymous finance giant, and for years kept an image of the banker hanging in his office in Menlo Park, California, said a person with knowledge of the firm.
Staying small is riskier as the profits have to come from the investments, not the fees. But Benchmark has no intention of changing.
“When it works,” Vishria said, “it’s really magical.”

Chatter About A.I. Stimulates Wall Street to New Highs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stock indexes rose to more records Wednesday after tech companies talked up how much of a boost they're getting from the artificial-intelligence boom.
The S&P 500 climbed 0.6 percent to add to what's set to be one of its best years of the millennium. It's the 56th time the index has hit a high this year after climbing in 11 of the last 12 days.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 308 points, or 0.7 percent, while the Nasdaq composite added 1.3 percent to its own record.
Salesforce helped pull the market higher after delivering stronger revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected, though its profit fell just short.
Mark Benioff, the chief executive, highlighted the company's artificial-intelligence offering for customers, saying "the rise of autonomous A.I. agents is revolutionizing global labor, reshaping how industries operate and scale." The stock price of the company, which helps businesses manage customers, jumped 11 percent.
Marvell Technology leaped even more after delivering better results than expected, up 23.2 percent. Its chief executive, Matt Murphy, said the semiconductor supplier is seeing strong demand from A.I. and gave a forecast for profit in the coming quarter that topped analysts' expectations.
All the optimistic talk helped Nvidia, the company whose chips are powering much of the move into A.I., rally 3.5 percent. It was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&P 500 by far.
They helped offset an 8.9 percent drop for Foot Locker, which reported profit and revenue short of analysts' expectations.
The chief executive, Mary Dillon, said the company is taking a more cautious view, and it cut its forecasts for sales and profit this year. Ms. Dillon pointed to how keen customers are for discounts and how soft demand has been outside of Thanksgiving week and other key selling periods.
Retailers overall have offered mixed signals about how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain. Their spending has been one of the main reasons the U.S. economy has avoided a recession that seemed inevitable after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to crush inflation. But shoppers are now contending with still-high prices and a slowing job market.
This week's highlight for Wall Street will be Friday's jobs report from the U.S. government, which will show how many people employers hired and fired last month. A narrower report on Wednesday suggested employers in the private sector increased their payrolls by less last month than economists expected. Hiring in manufacturing was the weakest since the spring, according to Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. The report strengthened traders' expectations that the Fed will cut its main interest rate again in two weeks.
Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said on Wednesday that the central bank can afford to cut rates cautiously because inflation has slowed from a peak two years ago and the economy remains sturdy.
A separate report on Wednesday said health care, finance and other businesses in the U.S. services sector are continuing to grow, but not by as much as before and not by as much as economists expected. One respondent from the construction industry told the survey from the Institute for Supply Management that the Fed's rate cuts haven't pulled down mortgage rates as much as hoped.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.18 percent from 4.23 percent late Tuesday.
Gains for airline stocks helped offset that drop after JetBlue Airways said it saw stronger bookings for travel in November and December after the presidential election. JetBlue jumped 8.3 percent, while Southwest Airlines climbed 3.5 percent.
In stock markets abroad, South Korea's Kospi sank 1.4 percent after a night full of drama in Seoul.
Bitcoin climbed near $ 99,000 after Donald J. Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins, a cryptocurrency advocate, to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Shoppers Seem Willing to Bite On Discounts Over Weekend: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Data on spending this week shows consumers are being drawn to discounts. Online Black Friday sales picked up at a faster pace this year than in-store shopping, Mastercard reported.
For weeks, businesses have been sending consumers endless offers of discounts on all sorts of items. On this long weekend, consumers finally bit.
Data released on Saturday showed that Americans took advantage of big deals on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, opening their wallets, though they were selective about what they bought.
Shoppers spent $ 10.8 billion online on Friday, according to data on Saturday from Adobe Analytics. That's on top of $ 6.1 billion spent online on Thursday, around 9 percent more than the previous year.
Another metric from Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures retail sales across all forms of payment, found that online sales on Black Friday had increased by nearly 15 percent but that in-store sales had increased by only 0.7 percent, for an overall increase of 3.4 percent. It said that jewelry, electronics and apparel were the top purchases, with discounts playing a role in consumer decisions.
"I think it's the consumer being mindful about how they're using their dollar and purchasing power, knowing they have so many choices," said Michelle Meyer, chief economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute. She said that in-store spending had been strong going into the holiday weekend, but on Black Friday itself, it was "sluggish."
These numbers offer an early look at how the holiday shopping season has gone so far. The National Retail Federation is set to update its figures next week, and those numbers will give a fuller accounting.
Ahead of the holiday weekend, as retailers issued forecasts for the coming months, they painted a picture of shoppers who have grown choosy, holding off on large purchases after years of faster-than-usual price increases and with interest rates still high.
"Consumers have been waiting all of 2024 for this moment to buy the goods they want and need at a lower price, and they seem to be pleased with the discounts they're seeing this week," said Caila Schwartz, the director of consumer insights at Salesforce, which also tracks spending data.
According to real-time data from Shopify, a provider of software to retail businesses, the top product categories by volume among its clients on Friday included items like T-shirts, skin care and makeup products, while purchases of electronics were more muted.
Anjee Solanki, the national director of retail services and practice groups at Colliers U.S., a professional services and investment management company, said that toys, beauty items, small kitchen appliances and shoes were "winners," with discounts of 30 to 50 percent off the list price.
The National Retail Federation has projected that sales will grow 2.5 to 3.5 percent during the November and December shopping season compared with last year, but how those sales are split among retailers could be significant. Retailers that specialize in big-ticket purchases have struggled to attract price-conscious consumers, while those that offer cheaper and more essential items have thrived.
Target, for instance, which relies more on discretionary purchases than its rival Walmart, has performed more poorly in recent months than it had expected. On the company's most recent earnings call, its executives said that consumers were choosing cheaper items like candles and vases, eschewing televisions. At the same time, analysts say that businesses that emphasize budget items, like Walmart, have been better positioned.
But the preliminary numbers for overall industry sales indicated that some consumers appeared to be making the bigger purchases that they had been holding off on.
Ms. Schwartz said that Americans had been saying for months that they were waiting until Black Friday to start making "splurge purchases."
"The sales and order growth over the last few days implies that these shoppers stayed true to their word," Ms. Schwartz said in a statement.
Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Analytics, said that "bigger-than-expected discounts" drove higher spending, especially as consumers remained "very conscious of prices."
Over the past decade, Black Friday has transformed from a stand-alone day, where Americans hustled to snag the hottest new appliances and electronics at the lowest possible price, to a monthslong campaign of discounts. The ease of online shopping has meant fewer Americans go out to stores on Friday, even as it remains one of the busiest days of the year for retailers.
Proposed tariffs by President-elect Donald J. Trump may also be having an effect on consumer psychology, analysts say. Those tariffs may be spurring bigger-ticket purchases before businesses pass on heightened import costs.
Though it's difficult to predict the precise effect of these tariffs, particularly since they are still just proposals, they may be influencing how consumers think about holiday spending, said Lars Perner, an associate professor of clinical marketing at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.
"I would imagine that some people, worried about the massive tariffs -- especially on imports from China -- would take advantage of holiday bargains before costs could go up dramatically," Dr. Perner said.

Power Figure Who Elevated Harris Profile: [National Desk]

Full text: The alliance between Kamala Harris and Laurene Powell Jobs is a genuine friendship that has thrust the press-shy billionaire philanthropist into the political spotlight.
After Vice President Joe Biden swore in Kamala Harris as a United States senator in January 2017, they posed for a customary photo in the Capitol with her family. Then she asked her future boss for a favor: Would he indulge in one more photo?
"Come on, everybody," Ms. Harris said, waving in a dozen others. "My extended family is here."
The first member of Ms. Harris's entourage to approach Mr. Biden just happened to be one of the richest people in the world: Laurene Powell Jobs.
Ms. Powell Jobs, the philanthropist who controls a fortune worth over $ 11 billion, stood just behind Mr. Biden's right shoulder, joining Ms. Harris's best friend from kindergarten and others in her inner circle. As the photo was snapped and the group broke up, Mr. Biden grabbed a coveted 60 seconds with Ms. Powell Jobs -- asking about her son and talking about his ambitions for cancer research.
Few figures have cultivated a more consequential friendship with Ms. Harris, now the Democratic nominee for president, than Ms. Powell Jobs, who for decades was married to one of America's most famous entrepreneurs, Steve Jobs.
Over the past 20 years, she has become one of Ms. Harris's most essential confidantes, providing counsel and money, and helping to expand Ms. Harris's public profile. Now, in this year's presidential race, the wealthiest woman in Silicon Valley has emerged as a powerful player behind the scenes. She has quietly contributed millions of dollars to an organization backing Ms. Harris, according to three people briefed on the gifts.
She played a hidden but key role in helping usher Mr. Biden out of the race, which cleared the way for a Harris run.
And Ms. Powell Jobs, who is so close to the vice president that her staff refers to her simply as "L.P.J.," is positioned to have extraordinary influence, or at least access, in a potential Harris administration.
"Laurene has a gift for friendship, especially old friends -- she is tribally loyal," said David Bradley, who sold The Atlantic magazine to Ms. Powell Jobs's company, the Emerson Collective. "Kamala Harris falls within that ring of friends."
Silicon Valley roots
Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, found himself at an intimate dinner in Washington last fall, along with Ms. Powell Jobs, Ms. Harris and Doug Emhoff, Ms. Harris's husband.
The women, he recalled, seemed especially at ease. "It was the vice president's residence," he said, "but they were sitting on the sofa like longtime girlfriends."
Over fish and African vegetables, Mr. Walker said, they chatted about art and recounted stories of their recent travels to Africa.
"There was no mention of any political leaders," he said. "No one mentioned Trump. No one mentioned the president."
Politicians often use the word "friend" to describe patrons who can power their campaigns and careers. Neither Ms. Harris nor Ms. Powell Jobs, who both zealously guard their privacy, would comment for this story. But in interviews, three dozen people with insight into their bond described a genuine friendship built on a shared political philosophy, an interest in art and culture and their mutual trials as women in the public spotlight.
Ms. Harris, 59, and Ms. Powell Jobs, 60, rose to prominence together in the Bay Area: Ms. Powell Jobs donated $ 500 to Ms. Harris's first run for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. The next year, they attended the March for Women's Lives in Washington, D.C., part of a "posse" of female leaders from the Bay Area, recalled Andrea Dew Steele, who organized the group.
"She was helpful early on in Kamala's career," Ms. Dew Steele recalled.
The women spent the next two decades traveling among the same Silicon Valley elite. They have attended each other's family events: Ms. Powell Jobs was one of about 60 people to attend Ms. Harris's wedding to Mr. Emhoff in 2014, and Ms. Powell Jobs invited Ms. Harris to the wedding of her son, Reed, this year in Hawaii, which Mr. Emhoff attended. They even shared the same celebrity dermatologist.
Even as Ms. Harris's career took her to Sacramento and Washington, they have gone on personal trips together, with Ms. Harris at times flying on Ms. Powell Jobs's private plane. They have prioritized one-on-one meals when they've found themselves in the same city: They have been spotted together at Quince, the San Francisco hot spot, and were once seen chatting with Rupert Murdoch at the high-end restaurant Nobu Malibu.
Susie Tompkins Buell, a San Francisco philanthropist who is close to both women, recalled the look on Ms. Powell Jobs's face as Ms. Harris spoke at her swearing-in as attorney general in 2011.
"I've watched them appreciate each other in a room full of a lot of people -- Laurene looking so proudly at Kamala when she was speaking, and just seeing this great sense of appreciation and pride," she said. She has texted with Ms. Powell Jobs in recent weeks about how to support Ms. Harris's presidential bid. "I know she's just besides herself with joy."
'I vote for her'
In 2017, Ms. Powell Jobs consented to a rare interview onstage at a tech conference hosted by the journalist Kara Swisher, who would become a New York Times opinion writer. She brought Ms. Harris along and made the interview a twofer.
It was the beginning of the Trump administration, but Ms. Swisher was already looking ahead to the next election. When she jokingly asked Ms. Powell Jobs if she was planning to run for president in 2020, Ms. Powell Jobs quickly turned the question into an opportunity to promote Ms. Harris, then a newly elected senator from California.
"Well, one of us should," Ms. Powell Jobs replied. She pointed at Ms. Harris and said, "I vote for her."
Ms. Powell Jobs's re-emergence into public and political life in the years since her husband died of cancer, in 2011, has been cautious and deliberate. She began making bigger political donations and lobbying Washington, pressing President Barack Obama on education at a closed-door Q. and A. with other tech billionaires during his 2012 re-election campaign, according to a person who was in the room.
Ms. Powell Jobs was, like her late husband, an enigma -- but she had sweeping ambitions. Politicians began to seek her out. Michelle Obama invited her to sit in her box during Mr. Obama's State of the Union address in 2012. Hillary Clinton cultivated her, and Ms. Powell Jobs hosted a 20-person, $ 200,000-a-head event for Mrs. Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. She struck up a friendship with Kevin McCarthy, the former Republican speaker of the House.
And as Ms. Harris sought higher office, Ms. Powell Jobs hosted a series of fund-raisers for her, including several at her house and one in 2014 with fellow Silicon Valley royalty like Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce; the investor Ron Conway, her closest political confidant; and Sean Parker, the early Facebook executive. In 2016, she spent election night taking selfies with Ms. Harris at a party in Los Angeles, celebrating Ms. Harris's election to the Senate.
As a senator, Ms. Harris often visited Emerson Collective's offices in Washington to speak with Ms. Powell Jobs, her staff and the billionaire's friends like Yo-Yo Ma and the fashion designer Marc Ecko.
Still, the sprawl of Ms. Powell Jobs's empire, vast even among ambitious Silicon Valley billionaires, sometimes gets in the way. Ms. Powell Jobs's 2017 near-total purchase of The Atlantic has at times made her reluctant to jump more fully into politics. She has told other Democrats that as the de facto owner of a large media company -- Ms. Powell Jobs has even tried her hand at journalism, interviewing Ms. Harris for an event hosted by The Atlantic -- she should not be a full-fledged partisan actor, to the frustration of some on both her and Ms. Harris's teams. She declined to significantly help Ms. Harris's presidential bid in 2019.
The fateful debate
Ms. Powell Jobs has visited the Biden-Harris White House nine times, but she has not always loved the administration.
The first years of Ms. Harris's tenure as vice president were especially difficult, as she drew criticism for her efforts on illegal immigration and reports of unhappiness among her staff. She frequently leaned on Ms. Powell Jobs, confiding in her about the toll that the public scrutiny was taking, according to a person briefed on the relationship, and Ms. Powell Jobs pushed other Democrats to defend her more vigorously.
But Ms. Powell Jobs's relationship with Mr. Biden has been trickier. She has been a major shareholder in Apple and Disney, and has bristled at some Biden policy positions that she considers anti-tech. She expressed frustration over what she considered hostile rhetoric from the president about rich people and Silicon Valley.
Then came the June debate.
After Mr. Biden's disastrous performance against former President Donald J. Trump, Ms. Powell Jobs expressed to other major Democratic donors her deep concerns about Mr. Biden's ability to win the election. One of her top aides, David Simas, a former Obama staff member who oversees her political research, circulated focus-group and polling data to other donors that painted a dire portrait. Several said that Mr. Simas's research was influential in encouraging them to mobilize against Mr. Biden.
As Mr. Biden insisted that he would not leave the race, Ms. Harris quietly tried to survey her options and navigate the sensitive politics of the moment. Among those she turned to for counsel was Ms. Powell Jobs.
Just weeks later, Ms. Powell Jobs was at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, sitting at times in Ms. Harris's exclusive friends and family box and watching her companion formally accept the party's nomination for president.
A Harris administration role?
Ms. Harris and Ms. Powell Jobs have talked for decades about the challenges of being women in the public eye -- and now the billionaire could help elect the country's first female president.
Ms. Powell Jobs was not particularly involved in Mr. Biden's re-election campaign, but she has told friends recently that she was energized by Ms. Harris's ascension. She has joined calls with Harris campaign officials in recent weeks and told them that she was eager to host an intimate, pricey event for her, similar to the one she threw for Mrs. Clinton, although with time short and money flooding in, officials are skeptical that an event will come together.
Ms. Powell Jobs has spoken with other female leaders in technology and encouraged them to publicly support Ms. Harris. And her team has circulated to other megadonors a list of 17 recommended pro-Harris organizations to which they can donate, including the super PAC Future Forward, where one of her senior political aides is working. Ms. Powell Jobs prefers to make undisclosed contributions, and she has donated millions to Future Forward's dark-money vehicle, according to three people briefed on the donations.
Friends of Ms. Powell Jobs have long thought she might want to go into politics. Some have wondered whether, if Ms. Harris wins the election, Ms. Powell Jobs might want a formal role in the administration, such as secretary of education, one of her top issues. Others hope she will simply use her clout to try to influence Ms. Harris more informally, such as by pushing her to support tougher measures to fight climate change.
Either way, Marc Porter Magee, an education-reform advocate, predicted that Ms. Powell Jobs would emerge as an insider in a Harris administration.
"Laurene is one of a small number of philanthropists who has both made significant investments in educational innovation and is also actively engaged in Democratic politics," he said. "If Harris wins, she and her staff could emerge as important players in an administration that has yet to define its K-12 agenda."
Is the publicity-averse Ms. Powell Jobs even interested in a Washington career?
"I do live a life of service now, and I feel like I am getting good at it," Ms. Powell Jobs told an interviewer in 2022. "It's not my intention," she said, "but I would not necessarily shy away from another opportunity."

After Vice President Joe Biden swore in Kamala Harris as a United States senator in January 2017, they posed for a customary photo in the Capitol with her family. Then she asked her future boss for a favor: Would he indulge in one more photo?
“Come on, everybody,” Harris said, waving in a dozen others. “My extended family is here.”
The first member of Harris’ entourage to approach Biden just happened to be one of the richest people in the world: Laurene Powell Jobs.
Powell Jobs, the philanthropist who controls a fortune worth more than $11 billion, stood just behind Biden’s right shoulder, joining Harris’ best friend from kindergarten and others in her inner circle. As the photo was snapped and the group broke up, Biden grabbed a coveted 60 seconds with Powell Jobs — asking about her son and talking about his ambitions for cancer research.
Few figures have cultivated a more consequential friendship with Harris, now the Democratic nominee for president, than Powell Jobs, who for decades was married to one of America’s most famous entrepreneurs, Steve Jobs.
Over the past 20 years, she has become one of Harris’ most essential confidants, providing counsel and money, and helping to expand Harris’ public profile. Now, in this year’s presidential race, the wealthiest woman in Silicon Valley has emerged as a powerful player behind the scenes. She has quietly contributed millions of dollars to an organization backing Harris, according to three people briefed on the gifts.
She played a hidden but key role in helping usher Biden out of the race, which cleared the way for a Harris run.
And Powell Jobs, who is so close to the vice president that her staff refers to her simply as “LPJ,” is positioned to have extraordinary influence, or at least access, in a potential Harris administration.
“Laurene has a gift for friendship, especially old friends — she is tribally loyal,” said David Bradley, who sold The Atlantic magazine to Powell Jobs’ company, the Emerson Collective. “Kamala Harris falls within that ring of friends.”
Silicon Valley Roots
Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, found himself at an intimate dinner in Washington last fall, along with Powell Jobs, Harris and Doug Emhoff, Harris’ husband.
The women, he recalled, seemed especially at ease. “It was the vice president’s residence,” he said, “but they were sitting on the sofa like longtime girlfriends.”
Over fish and African vegetables, Walker said, they chatted about art and recounted stories of their recent travels to Africa.
“There was no mention of any political leaders,” he said. “No one mentioned Trump. No one mentioned the president.”
Politicians often use the word “friend’ to describe patrons who can power their campaigns and careers. Neither Harris nor Powell Jobs, who both zealously guard their privacy, would comment for this story. But in interviews, three dozen people with insight into their bond described a genuine friendship built on a shared political philosophy, an interest in art and culture and their mutual trials as women in the public spotlight.
Harris, 59, and Powell Jobs, 60, rose to prominence together in the Bay Area: Powell Jobs donated $500 to Harris’ first run for district attorney of San Francisco in 2003. The next year, they attended the March for Women’s Lives in Washington, D.C., part of a “posse” of female leaders from the Bay Area, recalled Andrea Dew Steele, who organized the group.
“She was helpful early on in Kamala’s career,” Dew Steele recalled.
The women spent the next two decades traveling among the same Silicon Valley elite. They have attended each other’s family events: Powell Jobs was one of about 60 people to attend Harris’ wedding to Emhoff in 2014, and Powell Jobs invited Harris to the wedding of her son, Reed, this year in Hawaii, which Emhoff attended. They even shared the same celebrity dermatologist.
Even as Harris’ career took her to Sacramento and Washington, they have gone on personal trips together, with Harris at times flying on Powell Jobs’ private plane. They have prioritized one-on-one meals when they’ve found themselves in the same city: They have been spotted together at Quince, the San Francisco hot spot, and were once seen chatting with Rupert Murdoch at the high-end restaurant Nobu Malibu.
Susie Tompkins Buell, a San Francisco philanthropist who is close to both women, recalled the look on Powell Jobs’ face as Harris spoke at her swearing-in as attorney general in 2011.
“I’ve watched them appreciate each other in a room full of a lot of people — Laurene looking so proudly at Kamala when she was speaking, and just seeing this great sense of appreciation and pride,” she said. She has texted with Powell Jobs in recent weeks about how to support Harris’ presidential bid. “I know she’s just beside herself with joy.”
‘I Vote for Her’
In 2017, Powell Jobs consented to a rare interview onstage at a tech conference hosted by journalist Kara Swisher, who would become a New York Times opinion writer. She brought Harris along and made the interview a twofer.
It was the beginning of the Trump administration, but Swisher was already looking ahead to the next election.

She struck up a friendship with Kevin McCarthy, the former Republican speaker of the House.

Dow Hits High, but Big Tech Pulls Down S&P 500 and Nasdaq: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/dow-hits-high-big-tech-pulls-down-s-amp-p-500/docview/3097327779/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed to a high, even as big tech companies weighed on the broader market, leading U.S. stock indexes to a mixed finish on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent on Monday, remaining within 0.9 percent of its record set in July. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.9 percent, pulled down by several technology companies that tend to tip the market because of their big values. Nvidia lost 2.2 percent, Microsoft fell 0.8 percent, Amazon dropped 0.9 percent, Meta Platforms slid 1.3 percent and Tesla lost 3.25 percent.
The Dow rose 0.2 percent, to 41,240.52, eclipsing its previous high set in mid-July. The average is less influenced by Big Tech, with only Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable "Magnificent Seven" stocks in the index. That helped limit the impact of the Big Tech decliners.
The price of U.S. crude oil jumped 3.5 percent after Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah traded heavy fire on Sunday, triggering potential supply worries.
Bond yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.82 percent from 3.80 percent late Friday.
The stock market is coming off a two-week winning streak that has helped keep the S&P 500 and Dow within striking distance of notching new highs. Monday's mixed market finish came at the start of a week featuring another full slate of corporate earnings and the government's latest inflation reading.
Monday started off with a surprisingly good report showing that orders for long-lasting goods from U.S. factories, including cars, jumped 9.9 percent in July. An update on consumer confidence is on tap for Tuesday and the U.S. will provide a revised estimate on Thursday of economic growth during the second quarter.
The semiconductor company Nvidia reports its latest financial results on Wednesday. It has been a big beneficiary of Wall Street's mania around artificial intelligence, becoming one of the stock market's most massive companies, with a total value topping $ 3 trillion. The stock is up more than 155 percent for the year.
Shares in other chipmakers also fell. Broadcom lost 4.1 percent, Advanced Micro Devices dropped 3.2 percent and Lam Research slid 3.4 percent.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 17.77 points to 5,616.84. The Dow rose 65.44 points to 41,240.52, and the Nasdaq dropped 152.03 points to close at 17,725.76.
Others companies reporting quarterly results this week include Kohl's, Chewy, Salesforce and Dollar General.
The key report for investors this week will come on Friday, when the government serves up its latest data on inflation with the PCE, or personal consumption and expenditures report, for July. It is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.
Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell strongly signaled on Friday that the central bank plans to start cutting its benchmark interest rate, which stands at a two-decade high. The Fed raised interest rates to tame inflation back to its target of 2 percent. The final push to the target has been elusive.
Inflation has been steadily easing and economists polled by FactSet expect the latest PCE data to show a 2.6 percent inflation reading. The PCE was as high as 7.1 percent in 2022.
The Fed has been trying to tame inflation by slowing economic growth, but not by so much that it causes a recession. The dynamics of its concerns have shifted.
"Recent commentary coming out of conversations with Fed officials shows they care more about the risk of the economy slowing," said Nathan Thooft, chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management.
Traders are forecasting a rate cut to come at the Fed's meeting in September. They expect the central bank to trim its main interest rate by at least 1 percentage point by the end of the year, according to data from CME Group.

The Onion, All Kidding Aside, Thinks Print Is the Future of Media: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The funniest writers at The Onion shuffled through dozens of news stories at a meeting last week, trying to discern which headline would make readers laugh harder.
"Next Up: 911 Operator Calmly Talks Woman Through Macarena," suggested one writer, as his co-workers cackled. Another: "JD Vance Doubles Down on Controversial Criticism of Childless Children."
The headlines -- all 52 of them -- were completely fake, possible fodder for the satirical news site. But the jokesters behind those stories are also hard at work on a genuine experiment in the media business, one so counterintuitive that it sounds as if it could have been published in The Onion.
This week, The Onion began distributing a print edition for the first time in more than a decade and will soon deliver it monthly to everyone who subscribes to its site. The move is a throwback to the publication's roots as a campus weekly in the late 1980s.
But it is also emblematic of a growing trend in the media industry -- trying new ways to attract and retain digital subscribers.
The Onion is no stranger to the difficulties that face the publishing business. Its headlines have tracked the tumult in the media industry over the last several years, even occasionally poking fun at itself:
The Onion: 'Mild-Mannered Reporter Suddenly Transforms Into Incredible Unemployed Man'
The print edition is part of a variety of perks that the company plans to offer online subscribers, who pay $ 5 a month, said Ben Collins, the chief executive of The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron. The company plans to offer invites to live events, access to The Onion's archive of physical papers and sponsorship of ambitious editorial projects, such as a video titled "The Perfect One-Pot, Six-Pan, 10-Wok, 25-Baking-Sheet Dinner," Mr. Collins said.
"Do you know how much 10 woks cost these days?" he asked. "It's not pretty."
The Onion hopes to begin turning a profit later this year with the help of those subscription add-ons, said Mr. Collins, whose company took over the publication in April.
At the same time, The Onion is reducing its reliance on certain kinds of advertising. A month ago, it stopped running digital ads from the company Taboola, a purveyor of attention-grabbing links. Most of the ads in this month's print edition -- for Ashley Madison, WeWork and Chick-fil-A -- are fake, but there are some genuine promotions for The Onion. One of the ads: "It's That Sweater You Clicked On Once. We Found a Way to Follow You Into Print Media, Too."
The Onion: 'Major Shift in Media Landscape Occurs Every 6 Seconds'
Over the past 10 years, The Onion has changed hands three times. It was bought by the Spanish-language television company Univision, the digital publisher G/O Media and, this year, Global Tetrahedron. Along the way, there have been layoffs, tense contract negotiations and even the sale of The Onion's sister site, The A.V. Club.
But its 15 staff members are hoping the worst is behind them. Under the owner of Global Tetrahedron, Jeff Lawson, a co-founder of the tech company Twilio, the publication has enjoyed a relatively calm period.
Mr. Lawson said he had started joking with friends about buying The Onion after Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce, bought Time magazine in 2018. In early 2024, Mr. Lawson was introduced to a group interested in buying The Onion, including Mr. Collins; Leila Brillson, a former TikTok executive; and Danielle Strle, a product development executive.
"I said, 'I have $ 600 -- who wants to help me buy this?"' Mr. Collins said. He said he was lucky to be introduced to Mr. Lawson, "the only regular person in Silicon Valley."
Mr. Lawson said he hoped to own The Onion for the rest of his life. The business could be turned around, he said, if it focused first on satisfying its paying customers.
Mr. Lawson said he hadn't discussed his purchase of The Onion with Elon Musk -- the Tesla chief executive, who at one point discussed a bid for the site -- despite their shared love of satire.
"Unbelievably, not all Silicon Valley people hang out in an evil mountainside lair," Mr. Lawson said.
The Onion: 'Americans Demand New Form of Media to Bridge Entertainment Gap While Looking From Laptop to Phone'
The Onion will hand out its new print edition next week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago -- where The Onion is based -- though Mr. Collins joked that the publication was not credentialed to cover the event.
The major influx of influential journalists will make it a perfect opportunity to debut the print edition, said Jordan LaFlure, The Onion's executive editor.
Mr. LaFlure said he hoped the print newspaper would reach a younger generation of consumers who had already begun to show some affinity for analog substitutes of digital products.
"I think for the same reason that 18-year-old kids are buying Taylor Swift on vinyl," Mr. LaFlure said, "we can introduce those same kids to the notion that a print publication is a much richer way to consume media."
The staff doesn't seem to share that enthusiasm for all publications. One of the front-page headlines in The Onion this week: "New York Times to Cease Publication."

The funniest writers at The Onion shuffled through dozens of news stories at a meeting last week, trying to discern which headline would make readers laugh harder.
“Next Up: 911 Operator Calmly Talks Woman Through Macarena,” suggested one writer, as his co-workers cackled. Another: “JD Vance Doubles Down on Controversial Criticism of Childless Children.”
The headlines — all 52 of them — were completely fake, possible fodder for the satirical news site. But the jokesters behind those stories are also hard at work on a genuine experiment in the media business, one so counterintuitive that it sounds as if it could have been published in The Onion.
This week, The Onion began distributing a print edition for the first time in more than a decade and will soon deliver it monthly to everyone who subscribes to its site. The move is a throwback to the publication’s roots as a campus weekly in the late 1980s.
But it is also emblematic of a growing trend in the media industry — trying new ways to attract and retain digital subscribers.
The Onion is no stranger to the difficulties that face the publishing business. Its headlines have tracked the tumult in the media industry over the past several years, even occasionally poking fun at itself:
The Onion: ‘Mild-Mannered Reporter Suddenly Transforms Into Incredible Unemployed Man’
The print edition is part of a variety of perks that the company plans to offer online subscribers, who pay $5 a month, said Ben Collins, the CEO of The Onion’s parent company, Global Tetrahedron. The company plans to offer invites to live events, access to The Onion’s archive of physical papers and sponsorship of ambitious editorial projects, such as a video titled “The Perfect One-Pot, Six-Pan, 10-Wok, 25-Baking-Sheet Dinner,” Collins said.
“Do you know how much 10 woks cost these days?” he asked. “It’s not pretty.”
The Onion hopes to begin turning a profit later this year with the help of those subscription add-ons, said Collins, whose company took over the publication in April.
At the same time, The Onion is reducing its reliance on certain kinds of advertising. A month ago, it stopped running digital ads from the company Taboola, a purveyor of attention-grabbing links. Most of the ads in this month’s print edition — for Ashley Madison, WeWork and Chick-fil-A — are fake, but there are some genuine promotions for The Onion. One of the ads: “It’s That Sweater You Clicked On Once. We Found a Way to Follow You Into Print Media, Too.”
The Onion: ‘Major Shift in Media Landscape Occurs Every 6 Seconds’
Over the past 10 years, The Onion has changed hands three times. It was bought by Spanish-language television company Univision, digital publisher G/O Media and, this year, Global Tetrahedron. Along the way, there have been layoffs, tense contract negotiations and even the sale of The Onion’s sister site, The A.V. Club.

At X's Helm, Playing a Game of Whac-A-Mole: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Linda Yaccarino, the C.E.O. of X, has worked hard to bring back advertisers and fix the platform's business. But its owner, Elon Musk, is always one whim away from undoing her work.
Late last year, Linda Yaccarino reached out to Don Lemon's agent with an offer.
Ms. Yaccarino, the chief executive of X, a powerhouse advertising executive who had been hired away from NBC about seven months earlier, pitched the agent on bringing the former CNN anchor's new web-based show to the social media platform, citing its massive reach, political influence and connections with advertisers. Soon after, Mr. Lemon became one of the first high-profile names to sign onto Ms. Yaccarino's plan to help save the company's sagging advertising business with video and TV-like programming.
Elon Musk, who owns X, agreed to be Mr. Lemon's first guest.
The interview was held at the Tesla headquarters in Austin, Texas, which, Mr. Musk quickly pointed out to Mr. Lemon, was "about three times larger than the Pentagon." The two men sat on white Eames-like swivel chairs, a small white table between them. Mr. Musk was in a black T-shirt, Mr. Lemon in a white spread-collar shirt and a dark blue sweater.
The interview started out awkwardly, with Mr. Musk acknowledging that he hadn't really watched Mr. Lemon when he anchored a 9 p.m. show on CNN. ("I've seen a few segments.") It grew increasingly contentious over the next hour, and Mr. Musk became visibly frustrated with questions about his politics and drug use. "It's pretty private," Mr. Musk said when Mr. Lemon asked him about his prescription for ketamine, which Mr. Musk had posted about on X in 2023.
Mr. Lemon brought up complaints of sexual harassment at Tesla and SpaceX, both run by Mr. Musk, then asked if he had advantages in society as a white man. Mr. Musk raised an eyebrow. "You keep putting words in my mouth," he objected. And when Mr. Lemon asked about the advertiser exodus from X, Mr. Musk shook his head: "Don, I have to say, choose your questions carefully. There's five minutes left." As the interview ended, Mr. Musk shot up from his chair, offering an abrupt handshake to the anchor.
The next day, he texted Mr. Lemon's agent: "Contract canceled."
A day after Mr. Musk called off the deal, Ms. Yaccarino called Mr. Lemon to find out what went wrong. She seemed confident she could patch things up between him and her boss. But Mr. Musk remained firm; Mr. Lemon had to be dismissed. The deal died -- and with it, yet another attempt by Ms. Yaccarino to chart a profitable course for the troubled site.
Time and again, Ms. Yaccarino has faced similar situations, as Mr. Musk is always one whim away from undoing her work. Ms. Yaccarino's task of repairing and remaking X's business over the past year has been complicated by Mr. Musk's seeming disregard for the advertising industry and his constant unraveling of her efforts, according to interviews with more than a dozen advertising executives, X employees, former colleagues and friends.
After the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, for instance, Ms. Yaccarino told several major advertisers that she and X would work to fight antisemitism. The next month, Mr. Musk approvingly replied to an antisemitic theory on the site.
On Nov. 18, Ms. Yaccarino called on advertisers to come back to X to show their solidarity with the social media platform's commitment to free speech. Shortly afterward, in a fit of petulance, and with Ms. Yaccarino sitting a few feet away, Mr. Musk went onstage at The New York Times's DealBook Summit and used an expletive -- three times -- to tell advertisers in the audience that they could take their business elsewhere.
It's almost like a game of corporate Whac-a-Mole, which Ms. Yaccarino is doing her best to master.
If Ms. Yaccarino is frustrated by Mr. Musk's actions, she isn't showing it, at least not publicly. By all accounts, she seems to have accepted that this is the way Mr. Musk operates (in that phone call to Mr. Lemon, she said X was "Elon's baby") and that they have enough of a shared vision for X that she can grit her teeth and bear it. Over and over, Ms. Yaccarino has defended Mr. Musk's actions behind the scenes.
"The mark of a good C.E.O. is not how many punches you can throw, but how many you can take. She is the Muhammad Ali of C.E.O.s," said Ari Emanuel, the chief executive of the entertainment agency Endeavor, which is an investor in X. Mr. Emanuel is friends with Mr. Musk and speaks regularly with Ms. Yaccarino about X.
The company's business has struggled in recent months, as advertisers remain hesitant. Since Mr. Musk took the company private, it no longer publicly reports its earnings, but Emarketer, a market research agency, estimated that last year, X lost about 52 percent of its U.S. advertising revenue, which dropped to $ 1.13 billion. The firm predicted X's losses would slow to a 2.5 percent decrease this year.
X executives told employees last month that 65 percent of advertisers had reactivated their campaigns, although they appeared to be spending less than they once did. Internal documents obtained by The New York Times show that, in the second quarter of this year, X earned $ 114 million in revenue in the United States, a 25 percent decline from the first quarter and a 53 percent decline from the previous year. The company aims to reach $ 190 million in U.S. revenue during the third quarter, bolstered by advertising associated with the Olympics, football and political campaigns, the documents said -- but that target would still set the company's quarterly earnings at 25 percent less than they were last year.
Throughout all this turmoil, Ms. Yaccarino seemingly remains resolute. "My job is to clear the path for you all to succeed and for X to become the world's platform," she said during a leadership meeting at X's San Francisco office in May, according to two people who attended.
Ms. Yaccarino, 60, has forged a bond with her 53-year-old boss, chatting often by text message, according to one of the people, who, like many interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details. Some of Mr. Musk's friends have counseled her on how she should interact with the willful billionaire, or even offered to act as an intermediary with him. More strikingly, some of her friends and former colleagues have begged her to quit.
"You have to know this about Linda: Quitting equals failure, and Linda cannot allow herself to fail," said Lou Paskalis, a longtime ad executive and friend who has publicly criticized her decision to work for Mr. Musk. "She is cashing in her sterling reputation to be Elon's chief apology officer."
Ms. Yaccarino and Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for interviews.
Rising Through the Ranks
Ms. Yaccarino grew up on Long Island in New York, where her father was an assistant police chief and her mother was a civil servant. Her twin sister became a nurse and now runs her own health care company, and their older sister was a director at Deutsche Bank before retiring.
Ms. Yaccarino attended Pennsylvania State University and met her husband, Claude Madrazo, shortly after graduating in 1985. The couple have two children, a son and daughter. (She hired her son, Matt Madrazo, to sell political ads at X.) She began her career at Turner Entertainment, where she worked in ad sales for nearly 20 years.
As she rose at Turner, her role expanded to include programming. She worked on the reboot of Conan O'Brien's show after he departed NBC for TBS in 2010, hammering out ad deals that incorporated sponsored products into the program and lining up Mr. O'Brien to appear in commercials, an early iteration of influencer marketing. When Turner secured the rights to "Sex and The City" from HBO, Ms. Yaccarino pitched it to brands as a "virtual original," arguing that many Americans would be seeing the show for the first time when it landed on cable, recalled David Levy, the former president of Turner.
"She was a great leader, people loved to work with her. She was demanding, no question. That was what made her great. She worked harder than anyone else, and clients liked to be with her," Mr. Levy said. "Linda was brash, out there, aggressive. And dominating."
Her success convinced Steve Burke, then the chief executive at NBCUniversal, to hire her in 2011. She forged relationships with top marketers and on-air celebrities like Paris Hilton.
To develop her personal brand, Ms. Yaccarino hired communications specialists. In flashy presentations at the upfronts, an annual advertising event, she positioned television as the antithesis to Big Tech. "No family has ever gathered around a news feed," she said onstage in 2018. "We're not in the likes business -- we're in the results business."
The next year, Mr. Burke at NBCUniversal started succession planning so that he could step back from his chief executive role. Eyeing an opportunity, Ms. Yaccarino gunned for a promotion, three people who worked with her said. But she didn't get it. Ms. Yaccarino next made the argument that Comcast cable ad sales should be added to her portfolio. Again, she was denied by NBC leadership.
Ms. Yaccarino was an adroit negotiator who kept revenue rising even as ratings and viewership declined, those former colleagues said. But some argued she wasn't detail oriented enough to run a business, something others close to her dismissed as sexism, noting that the male executives she worked with sometimes teased her about her outfits, a sore subject for Ms. Yaccarino. An NBC spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
In a 2018 interview at Davos, she recounted the performance review she received before leaving Turner, in which she said her boss wrote approvingly of her work, but then added, "I only wish she would stop using her high heels as a weapon."
The comment helped convince her it was time to leave the job, she said. "Today, you might put that under a byproduct of unconscious bias, because who would ever look at a man's heels to say that's why they are being aggressive or assertive or powerful."
Still, she was a fiercely competitive saleswoman who took pride in getting better deals than executives at other networks did. "There is probably no better person that Elon could have hired to restore advertising on X," Mr. Paskalis said.
In October 2022, Ms. Yaccarino was in discussions with Netflix about an advertising partnership with NBCUniversal. The streaming giant instead suggested she come run ad sales, she told two of her former colleagues. While the job talks never went far, co-workers said it prompted Ms. Yaccarino to consider a career change. Coincidentally, Mr. Musk was then in the process of acquiring Twitter for $ 44 billion.
Within weeks of his takeover, hate speech flooded the platform as users tested Mr. Musk's "free speech" pledge. At the time, Ms. Yaccarino was part of Twitter's "Influence Council," a group of advertisers advising the company on working with brands. The council, which was formed in 2015 under the former owners, joined a call with Mr. Musk to discuss advertiser worries, during which he promised a safe environment.
Some top ad agencies recommended clients pause spending on Twitter until Mr. Musk determined how to police offensive content. Ignoring that advice, Ms. Yaccarino contacted Mr. Musk to pledge NBCUniversal's continued advertising and to decry the pause in spending by others, two people familiar with the conversation said. She offered to help inform other marketers that their fears were overblown and convince them of the power of the platform.
Mr. Musk soon laid off more than 75 percent of the company's employees, including most who kept watch for problematic posts. He changed the platform's rules and reinstated hundreds of previously banned accounts. Hate speech on the site surged, according to researchers tracking it, and more advertisers left.
By December, stock prices at Tesla, where Mr. Musk is chief executive, were plummeting. Investors questioned whether Mr. Musk was too distracted with Twitter to oversee the carmaker. On Dec. 20, Mr. Musk announced he was seeking a C.E.O. "foolish enough to take the job" to replace him at his social media company.
Mr. Musk and Ms. Yaccarino were in touch in early 2023 about NBC Universal running ads on X during the Super Bowl, and then started speaking more regularly. Ms. Yaccarino invited him to appear at the POSSIBLE advertising conference in Miami that April. "You challenge legacy, you challenge habits," she told Mr. Musk during an onstage interview.
He asked advertisers to return. "If somebody has something hateful to say, it doesn't mean you should give them a megaphone," Mr. Musk said. "They should still be able to say it -- but Twitter shouldn't amplify it."
On May 11, Mr. Musk posted that he had selected a chief executive. It was Ms. Yaccarino.
Ms. Yaccarino, who was in the middle of preparing for another upfronts presentation, hadn't yet told her NBCUniversal colleagues about the job offer, and began receiving text messages asking if she was Mr. Musk's pick. She rushed home from the company's studios.
Many of her longtime peers in the advertising world were shocked that Ms. Yaccarino accepted the job -- they feared she would tarnish her reputation by associating herself with Mr. Musk. But several colleagues who worked with her at X said she and Mr. Musk were more alike than their public personas might suggest. They share a fervent belief that their responsibilities range beyond running a viable business into rescuing the principle of free speech, a paranoia of sabotage from employees and associates, and a willingness to pursue legal action against critics.
Goodbye Twitter, Hello X
When Ms. Yaccarino took the helm on June 6, 2023, she confronted an immediate crisis: Mr. Musk's unconventional cost-cutting methods had resulted in a stack of unpaid rent, utility and software bills. She brought her most trusted deputy, a communications executive named Joe Benarroch, with her from NBCUniversal to help with the mess. (In a move that surprised many, Ms. Yaccarino abruptly fired Mr. Benarroch last month, having him escorted out of X's New York office.)
In her early days, Ms. Yaccarino renegotiated a cheaper contract with Google Cloud, which helped host Twitter's services. She resumed payments for databases and software that helped the company detect and remove child sexual exploitation material. And, at one of the company's international offices, she settled an unpaid heating bill. Before that, employees wore jackets indoors and tried to heat the space using a kitchen pizza oven.
She found a cadence with Mr. Musk, overseeing sales and partnerships while he controlled technology. They both weighed in on decisions about moderating content, although Mr. Musk made the final calls. Still, advertisers were spending in spits and starts.
Ms. Yaccarino met with several advertisers and researchers in June 2023 to reveal her plan for protecting brands from unsavory content -- tools which would allow advertisers to ensure that their posts did not appear next to specific keywords. X also planned to begin sharing ad revenue with popular users on the platform.
After the meeting, Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, asked in an email if he could present research on the rise in hate speech on the site. He also expressed concern that the new tools wouldn't protect advertisers, since ad dollars could still be funneled to hateful content creators through the revenue-sharing program.
"The challenge you face will soon become an even more acute concern when you implement your plans to 'revenue share,"' Mr. Ahmed wrote. "This will present a real moral challenge to advertisers who know that the money they give you goes directly to people like Andrew Tate and a rogue's gallery of homophobes, racists and snake oil salesmen." (Mr. Tate, a manosphere influencer who is facing criminal accusations over sexual misconduct, has more than 9.5 million followers on X.)
Ms. Yaccarino's team didn't reply to Mr. Ahmed's email. He later went on to publish research showing that hate speech and misinformation were rising on the platform.
Within weeks, Ms. Yaccarino suggested to Mr. Musk that Twitter sue the C.C.D.H. The resulting lawsuit, filed in late July, claimed that the C.C.D.H. had harmed the company's advertising business and that the group used improper methodology to gather its findings. (The suit was dismissed in March; X has appealed.)
In July 2023, Mr. Musk renamed Twitter as X. Although he had spoken publicly about wanting to turn the company into X, an "everything app," he announced the rebranding abruptly on social media without warning Ms. Yaccarino that it was coming, a person familiar with the matter said. Ms. Yaccarino, who learned about the name change from Mr. Musk's online posts, later said it signified the creation of an entirely new company.
Groups including the Anti-Defamation League were pressuring Mr. Musk to remove antisemitic content from X. Mr. Musk introduced Ms. Yaccarino to Jonathan Greenblatt, the A.D.L.'s director. "We had previously had what I would characterize as a good relationship," Mr. Greenblatt said of his connection to Mr. Musk.
During their discussion, Ms. Yaccarino pledged to crack down on hate speech. "Linda and I had a very cordial and constructive conversation," Mr. Greenblatt recalled. At the behest of an X policy team member, Mr. Greenblatt said in a post on X that the conversation was "frank + productive" and that he would give "credit if the service gets better ... and reserve the right to call them out until it does."
The post incited an immediate backlash. Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist livestreamer, and others campaigned for Mr. Musk to ban the A.D.L. from X. A hashtag calling for a ban spread rapidly, and Mr. Musk replied to several posts about it, then threatened to sue the A.D.L.
Mr. Greenblatt quickly struck back. "I am not daunted. I am not deterred. I am not frightened. I am going to continue to ferociously fight antisemitism," the A.D.L. director said.
The episode lent credence to the theory that Mr. Musk was boosting hate speech and that his C.E.O. was powerless to stop him. Ms. Yaccarino worked to undo the damage, setting a meeting at One World Trade Center with Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue and chief content officer of Condé Nast. The company spends tens of millions of dollars on advertising on X a year.
Ms. Wintour told Ms. Yaccarino that she had worked well with Mr. Greenblatt, implying that the feud with the A.D.L. would need to stop, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Ms. Yaccarino was reassuring: X wouldn't tolerate antisemitism, she promised.
Condé Nast kept advertising, and the A.D.L. later resumed spending, too.
On Sept. 28, Ms. Yaccarino arrived in Laguna Niguel, Calif., to speak at CODE, an annual tech and digital media summit. But as she arrived in the green room at the Ritz Carlton, she was blindsided by the news that a former Twitter trust and safety executive, Yoel Roth, had been added as a last-minute speaker at the conference.
Mr. Roth had quit the company in the wake of Mr. Musk's takeover and penned an editorial in The New York Times that sharply questioned some of the actions being taken by the new owner. Mr. Musk responded by engaging with an online harassment campaign against Mr. Roth that accused the former executive of inappropriate conduct. Mr. Roth warned Ms. Yaccarino from the stage that Mr. Musk might someday turn on her, too.
Julia Boorstin, a CNBC anchor who was scheduled to interview Ms. Yaccarino, apologized backstage for the sudden change of plans and coaxed her not to cancel her appearance. When they took the stage that afternoon, both appeared rattled. The tense interview that unfolded shocked the audience -- Ms. Yaccarino stumbled over basic company stats and fixated on Mr. Roth's earlier interview, a dramatic fumble after her many skilled presentations to advertisers at previous upfronts.
When Ms. Boorstin asked for her response to Mr. Roth, Ms. Yaccarino said, "Chuckles. Chuckling." But then she continued to dispute his claims about the safety of the platform. When Ms. Boorstin tried to redirect her to talking about X, Ms. Yaccarino complained: "Yoel had 25 minutes to talk."
Her appearance quickly spread on social media, all but drowning out her optimistic assertion that X would be profitable by early 2024. On the site itself, observers called it a "dumpster fire" and a "train wreck."
Afterward in the green room, tensions boiled over. Ms. Yaccarino confronted Ms. Boorstin, then rushed to the white Tesla waiting outside to whisk her away, Ms. Boorstin trailing behind in tears.
The disastrous interview capped Ms. Yaccarino's most tumultuous month on the job. Afterward, she retreated, canceling another public appearance at a Wall Street Journal conference and rehearsing endlessly for congressional testimony she was set to present in January.
A new threat arose as Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, and violent images from the resulting conflict spread rapidly on X. Ms. Yaccarino held daily meetings with X staffers grappling with content moderation in the politically fraught environment. But, on Nov. 15, Mr. Musk yet again seemed to undermine Ms. Yaccarino's efforts by endorsing the "great replacement" theory, an antisemitic conspiracy theory that minorities are replacing white European populations.
"You have said the actual truth," he replied to a user who posted it on X. Making matters worse, the advocacy group Media Matters for America released research on Nov. 16 showing ads on X adjacent to neo-Nazi posts.
'Get Comfortable'
On Nov. 18, during a conference call, several longtime advertising executives spoke to Ms. Yaccarino about their concerns with Mr. Musk's seeming embrace of antisemitism and encouraged her to resign, two people familiar with the call said. She had a duty to her team, she responded, and she did not think Mr. Musk's comment was out of line.
In a meeting with X sales employees days later, Ms. Yaccarino said the conference call amounted to sabotage, trying to disrupt plans for her daughter's upcoming wedding. "I am quite sure that that was not a coincidence," she told her colleagues.
Later that month, Mr. Musk admitted that endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory had been a mistake. But then came that expletive-ridden screed against advertisers at The Times's DealBook Conference, again bedeviling Ms. Yaccarino's efforts to calm the waters.
For once, Ms. Yaccarino seemingly had enough.
That evening, she and one of Mr. Musk's trusted confidants called him, making it clear that his onstage outburst had not been helpful. Ms. Yaccarino insisted that Mr. Musk had to smooth things by attending a dinner that night hosted by WPP, a giant advertising holding company. At first, Mr. Musk resisted, arguing he did not want to beg for money, two people said.
Ms. Yaccarino remained firm: Mr. Musk had to attend the dinner, she told him. He finally agreed.
Attendees welcomed Mr. Musk, and he ended up in a friendly chat with Mark Read, the chief executive of WPP, giving Ms. Yaccarino a rare chance to demonstrate her ability to influence Mr. Musk when it was crucial that she do so.
A few months later, as part of the technology conference CES in Las Vegas, a private dinner attracted more than 40 people, including curious marketing executives from Salesforce, the National Football League and the computer company Lenovo. Ms. Yaccarino, who hosted, had a message: "Get comfortable." Mr. Musk's vision of X as an anything-goes platform without strict content moderation wasn't going to change, she said.
Of course, X would police hate speech and child exploitation, she assured the marketers. But Twitter, which was governed by a mandate of ensuring "healthy conversations" and policed its users' toxic speech, was in the past.
"I was left with a strong impression that she is very much in charge of running the business-side operation," said Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner for the Federal Communications Commission who attended the dinner. "She's really articulating this vision that X can be a place for robust, wide open debate."
The Biden Announcement
If advertisers hoped Ms. Yaccarino might waver in her support of Mr. Musk's "anything goes" vision, the recent developments in the 2024 presidential campaign put an end to all that.
In late April, Ms. Yaccarino told colleagues that she would team up with the cable channel NewsNation to host a live-streamed presidential debate on X. Ms. Yaccarino later shifted to a town hall format that would allow former President Donald J. Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to respond to questions from X users. No date has yet been set, but Mr. Musk has been eager for X to play a role in the presidential race.
In the last few weeks, he has made clear his full-throated support of Mr. Trump. Roughly 30 minutes after the former president was shot and injured at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, Mr. Musk backed his bid for the White House. "I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery," Mr. Musk wrote on X. (His political leaning seems to dovetail with Ms. Yaccarino's -- she served on a presidential commission during Mr. Trump's last term and currently follows several Melania Trump fan accounts on X.)
The internal documents about X's revenue show that Ms. Yaccarino hopes to net $ 8 million in political advertising this quarter. If she succeeds, it would represent a marked increase from the company's political earnings when it was still Twitter -- the company earned less than $ 3 million from political advertisers during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, the last cycle before it banned political advertising.
And Mr. Musk seems to be backing up his words with the kind of influence that his enormous wealth can buy. A super PAC created by Mr. Musk and some of his closest allies has committed to spending tens of millions of dollars over the next few months to elect Mr. Trump.
As for X itself, the onslaught of political news has reminded the world of its potential, as when President Biden used the social media platform to announce he was dropping out of the presidential race.
That post from his official account -- which got 106 million views over the subsequent 24 hours -- gave Ms Yaccarino an opportunity for a victory lap. "X is where history happens," she boasted in a repost of Mr. Biden's announcement.
But what Ms. Yaccarino failed to mention -- or was perhaps unaware of -- was that Mr. Biden's announcement had been posted almost simultaneously on the rival sites Instagram, Threads and Facebook.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Late last year, Linda Yaccarino reached out to Don Lemon’s agent with an offer.
Yaccarino, the CEO of X, a powerhouse advertising executive who had been hired away from NBC about seven months earlier, pitched the agent on bringing the former CNN anchor’s new web-based show to the social media platform, citing its massive reach, political influence and connections with advertisers. Soon after, Lemon became one of the first high-profile names to sign onto Yaccarino’s plan to help save the company’s sagging advertising business with video and TV-like programming.
Elon Musk, who owns X, agreed to be Lemon’s first guest.
The interview was held at the Tesla headquarters in Austin, Texas — which, Musk quickly pointed out to Lemon, was “about three times larger than the Pentagon.” The two men sat on white Eames-like swivel chairs, a small white table between them. Musk was in a black T-shirt, Lemon in a white spread-collar shirt and a dark blue sweater.
The interview started out awkwardly, with Musk acknowledging that he hadn’t really watched Lemon when he anchored a 9 p.m. show on CNN. (“I’ve seen a few segments.”) It grew increasingly contentious over the next hour, and Musk became visibly frustrated with questions about his politics and drug use. “It’s pretty private,” Musk said when Lemon asked him about his prescription for ketamine, which Musk had posted about on X in 2023.
Lemon brought up complaints of sexual harassment at Tesla and SpaceX, both run by Musk, then asked if he had advantages in society as a white man. Musk raised an eyebrow. “You keep putting words in my mouth,” he objected. And when Lemon asked about the advertiser exodus from X, Musk shook his head: “Don, I have to say, choose your questions carefully. There’s five minutes left.” As the interview ended, Musk shot up from his chair, offering an abrupt handshake to the anchor.
The next day, he texted Lemon’s agent: “Contract canceled.”
A day after Musk called off the deal, Yaccarino called Lemon to find out what went wrong. She seemed confident she could patch things up between him and her boss. But Musk remained firm; Lemon had to be dismissed. The deal died — and with it, yet another attempt by Yaccarino to chart a profitable course for the troubled site.
Time and again, Yaccarino has faced similar situations, as Musk is always one whim away from undoing her work. Yaccarino’s task of repairing and remaking X’s business over the past year has been complicated by Musk’s seeming disregard for the advertising industry and his constant unraveling of her efforts, according to interviews with more than a dozen advertising executives, X employees, former colleagues and friends.
After the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, Yaccarino told several major advertisers that she and X would work to fight antisemitism. The next month, Musk approvingly replied to an antisemitic theory on the site.
On Nov. 18, Yaccarino called on advertisers to come back to X to show their solidarity with the social media platform’s commitment to free speech. Shortly afterward, in a fit of petulance, and with Yaccarino sitting a few feet away, Musk went onstage at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit and used an expletive — three times — to tell advertisers in the audience that they could take their business elsewhere.
It’s almost like a game of corporate Whac-A-Mole, which Yaccarino is doing her best to master.
If Yaccarino is frustrated by Musk’s actions, she isn’t showing it, at least not publicly. By all accounts, she seems to have accepted that this is the way Musk operates (in that phone call to Lemon, she said X was “Elon’s baby”) and that they have enough of a shared vision for X that she can grit her teeth and bear it. Over and over, Yaccarino has defended Musk’s actions behind the scenes.
“The mark of a good CEO is not how many punches you can throw, but how many you can take. She is the Muhammad Ali of CEOs,” said Ari Emanuel, the CEO of the entertainment agency Endeavor, which is an investor in X. Emanuel is friends with Musk and speaks regularly with Yaccarino about X.
The company’s business has struggled in recent months, as advertisers remain hesitant. Since Musk took the company private, it no longer publicly reports its earnings, but Emarketer, a market research agency, estimated that last year, X lost about 52% of its U.S. advertising revenue, which dropped to $1.13 billion. The firm predicted X’s losses would slow to a 2.5% decrease this year.
X executives told employees last month that 65% of advertisers had reactivated their campaigns, although they appeared to be spending less than they once did. Internal documents obtained by the Times show that, in the second quarter of this year, X earned $114 million in revenue in the United States, a 25% decline from the first quarter and a 53% decline from the previous year. The company aims to reach $190 million in U.S. revenue during the third quarter, bolstered by advertising associated with the Olympics, football and political campaigns, the documents said — but that target would still set the company’s quarterly earnings at 25% less than they were last year.
Throughout all this turmoil, Yaccarino seemingly remains resolute. “My job is to clear the path for you all to succeed and for X to become the world’s platform,” she said during a leadership meeting at X’s San Francisco office in May, according to two people who attended.
Yaccarino, 60, has forged a bond with her 53-year-old boss, chatting often by text message, according to one of the people, who, like many interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details. Some of Musk’s friends have counseled her on how she should interact with the willful billionaire or even offered to act as an intermediary with him. More strikingly, some of her friends and former colleagues have begged her to quit.
“You have to know this about Linda: Quitting equals failure, and Linda cannot allow herself to fail,” said Lou Paskalis, a longtime ad executive and friend who has publicly criticized her decision to work for Musk. “She is cashing in her sterling reputation to be Elon’s chief apology officer.”
Yaccarino and Musk did not respond to requests for interviews.
Rising Through the Ranks
Yaccarino grew up on Long Island in New York, where her father was an assistant police chief and her mother was a civil servant. Her twin sister became a nurse and now runs her own health care company, and their older sister was a director at Deutsche Bank before retiring.
Yaccarino attended Pennsylvania State University and met her husband, Claude Madrazo, shortly after graduating in 1985. The couple have a son and a daughter. (She hired her son, Matt Madrazo, to sell political ads at X.) She began her career at Turner Entertainment, where she worked in ad sales for nearly 20 years.
As she rose at Turner, her role expanded to include programming. She worked on the reboot of Conan O’Brien’s show after he departed NBC for TBS in 2010, hammering out ad deals that incorporated sponsored products into the program and lining up O’Brien to appear in commercials, an early iteration of influencer marketing. When Turner secured the rights to “Sex and the City” from HBO, she pitched it to brands as a “virtual original,” arguing that many viewers would be seeing the show for the first time when it landed on cable, recalled David Levy, the former president of Turner.
“She was a great leader; people loved to work with her,” Levy said. “She was demanding, no question. That was what made her great. She worked harder than anyone else, and clients liked to be with her. Linda was brash, out there, aggressive. And dominating.”
Her success persuaded Steve Burke, then CEO at NBCUniversal, to hire her in 2011. She forged relationships with top marketers and on-air celebrities like Paris Hilton.
To develop her personal brand, Yaccarino hired communications specialists. In flashy presentations at the upfronts, an annual advertising event, she positioned television as the antithesis to Big Tech. “No family has ever gathered around a news feed,” she said onstage in 2018. “We’re not in the likes business; we’re in the results business.”
The next year, Burke at NBCUniversal started succession planning so that he could step back from his CEO role. Eyeing an opportunity, Yaccarino gunned for a promotion, three people who worked with her said. But she didn’t get it. She next argued that Comcast cable ad sales should be added to her portfolio. Again, she was denied by NBC’s leaders.
Yaccarino was an adroit negotiator who kept revenue rising even as ratings and viewership declined, those former colleagues said. But some argued she wasn’t detail-oriented enough to run a business, something others close to her dismissed as sexism, noting that the male executives she worked with sometimes teased her about her outfits, a sore subject for Yaccarino. An NBC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
In a 2018 interview at Davos, she recounted the performance review she received before leaving Turner, in which she said her boss wrote approvingly of her work, but then added, “I only wish she would stop using her high heels as a weapon.”
The comment helped convince her it was time to leave the job, she said. “Today, you might put that under a byproduct of unconscious bias, because who would ever look at a man’s heels to say that’s why they are being aggressive or assertive or powerful.”
Still, she was a fiercely competitive salesperson who took pride in getting better deals than executives at other networks did. “There is probably no better person that Elon could have hired to restore advertising on X,” Paskalis said.
In October 2022, Yaccarino was in discussions with Netflix about an advertising partnership with NBCUniversal. The streaming giant instead suggested she come run ad sales, she told two of her former colleagues. While the job talks never went far, co-workers said it prompted Yaccarino to consider a career change. Coincidentally, Musk was then in the process of acquiring Twitter for $44 billion.
Within weeks of his takeover, hate speech flooded the platform as users tested Musk’s “free speech” pledge. At the time, Yaccarino was part of Twitter’s “Influence Council,” a group of advertisers advising the company on working with brands. The council, which was formed in 2015 under the former owners, joined a call with Musk to discuss advertiser worries, during which he promised a safe environment.
Some top ad agencies recommended clients pause spending on Twitter until Musk determined how to police offensive content. Ignoring that advice, Yaccarino contacted Musk to pledge NBCUniversal’s continued advertising and to decry the pause in spending by others, two people familiar with the conversation said. She offered to help inform other marketers that their fears were overblown and convince them of the power of the platform.
Musk soon laid off more than 75% of the company’s employees, including most who kept watch for problematic posts. He changed the platform’s rules and reinstated hundreds of previously banned accounts. Hate speech on the site surged, according to researchers tracking it, and more advertisers left.
By December, stock prices at Tesla, where Musk is CEO, were plummeting. Investors questioned whether Musk was too distracted with Twitter to oversee the carmaker. On Dec. 20, Musk announced he was seeking a CEO “foolish enough to take the job” to replace him at his social media company.
Musk and Yaccarino were in touch in early 2023 about NBC Universal running ads on X during the Super Bowl, then started speaking more regularly. Yaccarino invited him to appear at the POSSIBLE advertising conference in Miami that April. “You challenge legacy; you challenge habits,” she told Musk during an onstage interview.
He asked advertisers to return. “If somebody has something hateful to say, it doesn’t mean you should give them a megaphone,” Musk said. “They should still be able to say it — but Twitter shouldn’t amplify it.”
On May 11, Musk posted that he had selected a CEO. It was Yaccarino.
Yaccarino, who was in the middle of preparing for another upfronts presentation, hadn’t yet told her NBCUniversal colleagues about the job offer, and she began receiving text messages asking if she was Musk’s pick. She rushed home from the company’s studios.
Many of her longtime peers in the advertising world were shocked that Yaccarino accepted the job; they feared she would tarnish her reputation by associating herself with Musk. But several colleagues who worked with her at X said she and Musk were more alike than their public personas might suggest. They share a fervent belief that their responsibilities range beyond running a viable business into rescuing the principle of free speech, a paranoia of sabotage from employees and associates, and a willingness to pursue legal action against critics.
Goodbye Twitter, Hello X
When Yaccarino took the helm June 6, 2023, she confronted an immediate crisis: Musk’s unconventional cost-cutting methods had resulted in a stack of unpaid rent, utility and software bills. She brought her most trusted deputy, a communications executive named Joe Benarroch, with her from NBCUniversal to help with the mess. (In a move that surprised many, Yaccarino abruptly fired Benarroch last month, having him escorted out of X’s New York office.)
In her early days, Yaccarino renegotiated a cheaper contract with Google Cloud, which helped host Twitter’s services. She resumed payments for databases and software that helped the company detect and remove child sexual exploitation material. And at one of the company’s international offices, she settled an unpaid heating bill. Before that, employees wore jackets indoors and tried to heat the space using a kitchen pizza oven.
She found a cadence with Musk, overseeing sales and partnerships while he controlled technology. They both weighed in on decisions about moderating content, although Musk made the final calls. Still, advertisers were spending in fits and starts.
Yaccarino met with several advertisers and researchers in June 2023 to reveal her plan for protecting brands from unsavory content — tools which would allow advertisers to ensure that their posts did not appear next to specific keywords. X also planned to begin sharing ad revenue with popular users on the platform.
After the meeting, Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, asked in an email if he could present research on the rise in hate speech on the site. He also expressed concern that the new tools wouldn’t protect advertisers, since ad dollars could still be funneled to hateful content creators through the revenue-sharing program.
“The challenge you face will soon become an even more acute concern when you implement your plans to ‘revenue share,’” Ahmed wrote. “This will present a real moral challenge to advertisers who know that the money they give you goes directly to people like Andrew Tate and a rogue’s gallery of homophobes, racists and snake oil salesmen.” (Tate, a manosphere influencer who is facing criminal accusations over sexual misconduct, has more than 9.5 million followers on X.)
Yaccarino’s team didn’t reply to Ahmed’s email. He later went on to publish research showing that hate speech and misinformation were rising on the platform.
Within weeks, Yaccarino suggested to Musk that Twitter sue the CCDH. The resulting lawsuit, filed in late July, claimed that the CCDH had harmed the company’s advertising business and that the group used improper methodology to gather its findings. (The suit was dismissed in March; X has appealed.)
In July 2023, Musk renamed Twitter as X. Although he had spoken publicly about wanting to turn the company into X, an “everything app,” he announced the rebranding abruptly on social media without warning Yaccarino that it was coming, a person familiar with the matter said. Yaccarino, who learned about the name change from Musk’s online posts, later said it signified the creation of an entirely new company.
Groups including the Anti-Defamation League were pressuring Musk to remove antisemitic content from X. Musk introduced Yaccarino to Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL’s director. “We had previously had what I would characterize as a good relationship,” Greenblatt said of his connection to Musk.
During their discussion, Yaccarino pledged to crack down on hate speech. “Linda and I had a very cordial and constructive conversation,” Greenblatt recalled. At the behest of an X policy team member, Greenblatt said in a post on X that the conversation was “frank + productive” and that he would give “credit if the service gets better ... and reserve the right to call them out until it does.”
The post incited an immediate backlash. Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist livestreamer, and others campaigned for Musk to ban the ADL from X. A hashtag calling for a ban spread rapidly, and Musk replied to several posts about it, then threatened to sue the ADL.
Greenblatt quickly struck back. “I am not daunted,” he said. “I am not deterred. I am not frightened. I am going to continue to ferociously fight antisemitism.”
The episode lent credence to the theory that Musk was boosting hate speech and that his CEO was powerless to stop him. Yaccarino worked to undo the damage, setting a meeting at One World Trade Center with Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue and chief content officer of Condé Nast. The company spends tens of millions of dollars on advertising on X a year.
Wintour told Yaccarino that she had worked well with Greenblatt, implying that the feud with the ADL would need to stop, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Yaccarino was reassuring: X wouldn’t tolerate antisemitism, she promised.
Condé Nast kept advertising, and the ADL later resumed spending, too.
On Sept. 28, Yaccarino arrived in Laguna Niguel, California, to speak at CODE, an annual tech and digital media summit. But as she arrived in the green room at the Ritz Carlton, she was blindsided by the news that a former Twitter trust and safety executive, Yoel Roth, had been added as a last-minute speaker at the conference.
Roth had quit the company in the wake of Musk’s takeover and wrote an editorial in the Times that sharply questioned some of the actions being taken by the new owner. Musk responded by engaging with an online harassment campaign against Roth that accused the former executive of inappropriate conduct. Roth warned Yaccarino from the stage that Musk might someday turn on her, too.
Julia Boorstin, a CNBC anchor who was scheduled to interview Yaccarino, apologized backstage for the sudden change of plans and coaxed her not to cancel her appearance. When they took the stage that afternoon, both appeared rattled. The tense interview that unfolded shocked the audience; Yaccarino stumbled over basic company stats and fixated on Roth’s earlier interview, a dramatic fumble after her many skilled presentations to advertisers at previous upfronts.
When Boorstin asked for her response to Roth, Yaccarino said, “Chuckles. Chuckling.” But then she continued to dispute his claims about the safety of the platform. When Boorstin tried to redirect her to talking about X, Yaccarino complained, “Yoel had 25 minutes to talk.”
Her appearance quickly spread on social media, all but drowning out her optimistic assertion that X would be profitable by early 2024. On the site itself, observers called it a “dumpster fire” and a “train wreck.”
Afterward in the green room, tensions boiled over. Yaccarino confronted Boorstin, then rushed to the white Tesla waiting outside to whisk her away, Boorstin trailing behind in tears.
The disastrous interview capped Yaccarino’s most tumultuous month on the job. Afterward, she retreated, canceling another public appearance at a Wall Street Journal conference and rehearsing endlessly for congressional testimony she was set to present in January.
A new threat arose as Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, and violent images from the resulting conflict spread rapidly on X. Yaccarino held daily meetings with X staff members grappling with content moderation in the politically fraught environment. But on Nov. 15, Musk yet again seemed to undermine Yaccarino’s efforts by endorsing the “great replacement” theory, an antisemitic conspiracy theory that minorities are replacing white European populations.
“You have said the actual truth,” he replied to a user who posted it on X. Making matters worse, the advocacy group Media Matters for America released research Nov. 16 showing ads on X adjacent to neo-Nazi posts.
‘Get Comfortable’
On Nov. 18, during a conference call, several longtime advertising executives spoke to Yaccarino about their concerns with Musk’s seeming embrace of antisemitism and encouraged her to resign, two people familiar with the call said. She had a duty to her team, she responded, and she did not think Musk’s comment was out of line.
In a meeting with X sales employees days later, Yaccarino said the conference call amounted to sabotage, trying to disrupt plans for her daughter’s upcoming wedding. “I am quite sure that that was not a coincidence,” she told her colleagues.
Later that month, Musk admitted that endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory had been a mistake. But then came that expletive-ridden screed against advertisers at the Times’ DealBook Summit, again bedeviling Yaccarino’s efforts to calm the waters.
For once, Yaccarino seemingly had enough.
That evening, she and one of Musk’s trusted confidants called him, making it clear that his onstage outburst had not been helpful. Yaccarino insisted that Musk had to smooth things by attending a dinner that night hosted by WPP, a giant advertising holding company. At first, Musk resisted, arguing he did not want to beg for money, two people said.
Yaccarino remained firm: Musk had to attend the dinner, she told him. He finally agreed.
Attendees welcomed Musk, and he ended up in a friendly chat with Mark Read, the CEO of WPP, giving Yaccarino a rare chance to demonstrate her ability to influence Musk when it was crucial that she do so.
A few months later, as part of the technology conference CES in Las Vegas, a private dinner attracted more than 40 people, including curious marketing executives from Salesforce, the NFL and the computer company Lenovo. Yaccarino, who hosted, had a message: “Get comfortable.” Musk’s vision of X as an anything-goes platform without strict content moderation wasn’t going to change, she said.
Of course, X would police hate speech and child exploitation, she assured the marketers. But Twitter, which was governed by a mandate of ensuring “healthy conversations” and policed its users’ toxic speech, was in the past.
“I was left with a strong impression that she is very much in charge of running the business-side operation,” said Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner for the Federal Communications Commission who attended the dinner. “She’s really articulating this vision that X can be a place for robust, wide-open debate.”
The Biden Announcement
If advertisers hoped Yaccarino might waver in her support of Musk’s “anything goes” vision, the recent developments in the 2024 presidential campaign put an end to all that.
In April, Yaccarino told colleagues that she would team up with the cable channel NewsNation to host a livestreamed presidential debate on X. Yaccarino later shifted to a town hall format that would allow former President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to respond to questions from X users. No date has yet been set, but Musk has been eager for X to play a role in the presidential race.
In the past few weeks, he has made clear his full-throated support of Trump. Roughly 30 minutes after the former president was shot and injured at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13, Musk backed his bid for the White House. “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” Musk wrote on X. (His political leaning seems to dovetail with Yaccarino’s; she served on a presidential commission during Trump’s term and follows several Melania Trump fan accounts on X.)
The internal documents about X’s revenue show that Yaccarino hopes to net $8 million in political advertising this quarter. If she succeeds, it would represent a marked increase from the company’s political earnings when it was still Twitter; the company earned less than $3 million from political advertisers during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, the last cycle before it banned political advertising.
And Musk seems to be backing up his words with the kind of influence that his enormous wealth can buy. A super political action committee created by Musk and some of his closest allies has committed to spending tens of millions of dollars over the next few months to elect Trump.
As for X itself, the onslaught of political news has reminded the world of its potential, as when President Joe Biden used the social media platform to announce he was dropping out of the presidential race.
That post from his official account — which got 106 million views over the subsequent 24 hours — gave Yaccarino an opportunity for a victory lap. “X is where history happens,” she boasted in a repost of Biden’s announcement.
But what Yaccarino failed to mention — or was perhaps unaware of — was that Biden’s announcement had been posted almost simultaneously on the rival sites Instagram, Threads and Facebook.

Tech Sector Propels Idea For Cash Aid: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For the last couple of years, the tech community has tested no-strings-attached payments of $ 500 or $ 1,000 a month to those in dire need. Some of these experiments have happened in the heart of Silicon Valley, where a one-bedroom apartment rents for $ 3,000 a month and a modest house is often an unaffordable luxury.
Silicon Valley's backing of these efforts has propelled the idea of a guaranteed income -- also known as cash transfers, unconditional cash and, in its most utopian form, universal basic income -- into the mainstream. But a bipartisan political consensus around the movement is fracturing even though the data seems to show that the programs are effective.
In recent months, the Texas attorney general went to court to prevent public funds from being used in a basic income program in Houston. Republicans in Iowa, Idaho and South Dakota banned similar programs. A ban in Arizona was vetoed by the governor.
The movement has scored a few victories, too. A proposal for a statewide basic income program is likely to be on the ballot in Oregon this fall. The measure would give $ 750 to each state resident annually, funded by a 3 percent tax on corporations with revenue over $ 25 million.
It is a critical moment for guaranteed income, which has been touted by the OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, the Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, the Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff and others.
On Monday, the results from the biggest direct income program to date, the Unconditional Income Study, will be released. The study was the idea of Mr. Altman, who has emerged as the chief cheerleader of a boom in artificial intelligence that, he says, will sweep away all that came before it. Anyone whose job can be done by A.I. software might need a guaranteed income by and by.
"It's impossible to truly have equality of opportunity without some version of guaranteed income," Mr. Altman said in 2016 when he announced the effort to gather data about a policy that had not been rigorously tested. Critics wondered if recipients would blow the funds on lottery tickets and booze.
Dozens of pilot programs that took fewer years than the Unconditional Income Study have since answered that question. Basic income is not a panacea, and it does not solve the problem of unaffordable housing, proponents said, but the payments have helped to stabilize families who live on the edge, preventing them from tumbling off.
While they welcomed Mr. Altman's study, the issue for members of the basic income community has shifted to establishing the programs on a wider scale. The time for research, they say, is over.
"This country is on fire, Mr. Altman," said Jennifer Loving, who runs Destination: Home, a nonprofit that administers basic-income pilot programs in Silicon Valley. "Some people in America are becoming rich, and many, many more are becoming poor. What is your responsibility in bridging that divide rather than making it worse?"
Mr. Altman, who is one of those becoming rich, declined to be interviewed before his report is released. Ms. Loving has a few ideas for what he and other tech leaders should do then.
"I'd like to see Silicon Valley use its access to power to lobby for guaranteed income so the federal government will do it at scale," she said. "The government is ultimately responsible, but tech must be a partner."
Others think Silicon Valley has a more forceful role to play. Technology companies have created trillions of dollars of wealth over the last quarter century. If A.I. fulfills its hype, it will make trillions more while pushing down wages or eliminating many jobs altogether.
"Although all wealthy people and corporations should support a universal basic income, the tech industry has special responsibilities," said Karl Widerquist, a philosophy professor at Georgetown University in Qatar who has been a co-author and an editor of books on the topic. "They're using our data to create their products and haven't paid us back. And they're the ones saying they'll disrupt the economy and put people out of work."
A handful of tech people have played outsize roles in bringing basic income this far. Mr. Dorsey made a $ 15 million commitment to fund programs at the height of the pandemic. Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, has also been a prominent promoter. He helped to start the Basic Income Lab at Stanford University in 2017 and has funded several pilot programs.
"I talk to people about philanthropy and how to make change in the world, but not many are tech people," Mr. Hughes said, adding that he hasn't been in Silicon Valley in years, and the people there don't seek him out.
Michael Tubbs is a former mayor of Stockton, Calif., which started a guaranteed income pilot in 2019, and the founder of a group called Mayors for a Guaranteed Income. "I've approached dozens of folks in Silicon Valley," he said. "I get polite interest and no movement."
In Santa Clara County, Calif., which includes the communities of Palo Alto, Mountain View and Cupertino -- the heart of Silicon Valley -- a public-private partnership of local governments and nonprofits like Destination: Home have nine pilot programs either running or being developed, with 950 people getting around $ 1,000 a month. About a third of the $ 26 million budget comes from the tech community, including Google.org, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and, indirectly, Cisco and Apple.
The budget for Mr. Altman's study was $ 60 million. He hired Elizabeth Rhodes, a scholar with a joint doctorate in social work and political science, to run the effort, set up an affiliate called OpenResearch to house it and spent $ 14 million of his own money to fund it.
Another $ 10 million came from OpenAI, $ 15 million from Mr. Dorsey's public fund for global Covid relief and $ 6.5 million from Sid Sijbrandij, a founder of the GitLab open source software platform. The rest came from foundations, federal grants and personal and anonymous donations. (The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement.)
In 2019, after some preliminary work, OpenResearch began enrolling 3,000 people in Texas and Illinois who had annual incomes of less than $ 28,000. A third received $ 1,000 a month; the others, who functioned as a control group, got $ 50. The program lasted three years.
Among the topics the experiment aimed to investigate was how unconditional cash shapes behavior, including its ability to affect stress levels and raise hopes for a better future. With increased financial security, some people might take a lower-paying job they like better or increase their participation in society by, say, volunteering. Others could go back to school or sign up for additional training.
Mr. Benioff, who co-founded the software company Salesforce in 1999, has long been critical of the tech community's philanthropic efforts. "Silicon Valley is good at building products and building companies and hiring lots of people, but it has a long way to go on social responsibility," he said in a text message.
In 2019, Mr. Benioff and his wife, Lynne, gave $ 30 million to fund the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco, which is studying basic income programs. He said basic income programs should be led by the government, although he also said any new programs would be "in direct conflict with the huge deficits and entitlements our government is already supporting."
Told that he was simultaneously arguing that Silicon Valley should do more and that it was really the government's job but that the government was overburdened, Mr. Benioff responded by texting a link to the Wikipedia page for capitalism.
Silicon Valley's zeal for all things A.I., just like its enthusiasm a few years ago for all things related to crypto and the blockchain, is capitalism unleashed. A few years ago, none of the top tech companies had market capitalizations of more than $ 1 trillion. Now, on the strength of A.I., Microsoft is worth $ 3.4 trillion; Google, $ 2.3 trillion; and the chipmaker Nvidia, $ 3.1 trillion.
Some people in the basic income movement are worried that it might become "a Trojan horse" for A.I., as Juliana Bidadanure, the former director of the Stanford Basic Income Lab, puts it.
"Is Silicon Valley pushing basic income as a way to make the state smaller? To replace all the other safety nets? A way to accelerate A.I.?" Ms. Bidadanure asked. "Personally, I think that unemployment due to A.I. is one important reason to build a robust floor through a universal basic income. But it is one reason among many."
Another reason basic income backers may not be able to rely on Silicon Valley is that the tech industry's support may prove fickle. Mr. Musk said in 2018 that "universal income will be necessary over time if A.I. takes over most human jobs." But in November he said: "We won't have universal basic income. We'll have universal high income." He didn't explain the difference.
In a podcast interview in May, Mr. Altman said he wondered "if the future looks more like universal basic compute than universal basic income."
In other words, people will get computing time rather than cash, and Silicon Valley -- or perhaps just OpenAI -- would take dominion everywhere.

Recent Market Activity Betting on a Trump Win: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Donald Trump's running mate is pro-labor, a fan of crypto and the F.T.C.'s Lina Khan, and says Big Tech is too powerful.
A new wave Republican
Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance as his running mate and a possible successor to lead the "Make America Great Again" movement.
Much will be made of Vance's light political résumé -- he was elected to the Senate only two years ago. He's also been scathing about Trump in the past, having called him an "idiot" and himself a "Never Trump guy." But Vance says he's a convert, becoming one of Trump's biggest backers and adopting a similarly populist approach to the economy and business.
Vance's biography appeals to left-behind voters -- and investors. The 39-year-old served in Iraq and later went to Yale Law School, where he met his wife, Usha Vance. (She resigned from her role as a trial lawyer at Munger Tolles & Olson after Vance joined the ticket.) Vance rose to national prominence after publishing the best-selling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy." He worked at Mithril Capital Management, a venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, and Steve Case's Revolution. He also started his own fund with backing from Thiel, Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen.
Silicon Valley helped get him on the ticket. Vance is close to the libertarian wing of the tech industry. Thiel gave millions to his Ohio Senate campaign in 2022 and Vance is reportedly close to David Sacks, the venture capitalist who has hosted a Trump fund-raiser at his home and spoke at the Republican National Convention on Monday.
DealBook examined Vance's links to business, and his views on the economy and industry:
Vance has been tough on regulation, and has backed Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair. Some tech investors celebrated having a former V.C. on the ticket. But Vance has said Big Tech is too powerful and called for Google to be broken up. He's also backed some of the Biden administration's efforts to constrain the industry. While many Republicans and business leaders have attacked Khan, Vance has said she is "one of the few people in the Biden administration who I think is doing a pretty good job."
Vance is pro labor. He says the postwar economy has relied too heavily on cheaper labor, a tactic that undercuts wages for American workers and has been exploited by big business. He's argued that employers' zeal for cheap labor has helped lead to a surge in unauthorized immigration to the U.S. and that consumers have become addicted to products made in low-wage countries. Those factors have aggravated America's foreign trade deficit and hit domestic manufacturing, he's said.
Vance isn't sold on the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. Last year, during an exchange with Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, Vance said dollar dominance was good for Americans' purchasing power but a "tax on American producers." Like Trump, he is supportive of crypto and is reportedly working on legislation that would change how the U.S. regulates digital assets.
Vance is all in for Big Oil. He has expressed skepticism about the role of humans in causing climate change, and has attacked the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided incentives for the green transitions. Instead, he called for more drilling for shale oil in Ohio.
He's seen as another Republican who has distanced himself from the pro-globalization wing of the party. "Vance is a leader of the post-financial crisis Republican generation," Matt Stoller, research director at the American Economic Liberties Project, told DealBook, and is trying to reorient how the party thinks about economic policy.
Yet Vance's ideological approach, and his positive comments about Khan, worry some in business. "Trump populism and Vance populism are not the same," one big bank lobbyist told The Financial Times.
In other election news: The Democratic National Committee is moving to push President Biden toward the nomination, as he returns to campaigning and reiterated in an interview with NBC News that he wouldn't withdraw.
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Markets grow hopeful for more rate cuts. Jay Powell, the Fed chair, indicated on Monday that the central bank could lower borrowing costs before inflation falls to a 2 percent target. The dovish signal comes as traders see room for the Fed to cut three times this year; Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs's chief economist, asked in an investor note whether that should start this month.
Macy's stock tumbles after the retailer calls off sale talks. Shares in the retailer fell nearly 12 percent on Monday after the company said it had broken off discussions with the investment firms Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, citing uncertainty over financing. That puts more focus on Macy's turnaround plan, which includes closing stores.
Sequoia is said to offer its investors a way to cash out of Stripe. The venture capital firm plans to buy up to $ 861 million worth of shares in the payment processor at a $ 70 billion valuation, Axios reports. The deal is meant to give investors more liquidity (a big issue for many private investment firms), given that Sequoia has been invested in Stripe for nearly 14 years and the payments company appears unlikely to go public anytime soon.
General Motors tamps down expectations for electric-vehicle production. Mary Barra, the car maker's C.E.O., said that the company wouldn't have the production capacity to make one million E.V.s at the end of 2025, an acknowledgment it will fall short of a stated target. It's the latest sign of a slowdown in the E.V. market's growth, though Barra added that demand will eventually pick up.
Musk offers money and words to back Trump
Days after Elon Musk publicly endorsed Donald Trump for president, it now appears that the tech billionaire is prepared to offer financial support as well.
Musk is likely to donate a significant amount to America PAC, a pro-Trump group whose backers already include a number of Musk's Silicon Valley allies, The Times and others report. It's another sign that the Tesla chief intends to take a more active role in seeking Trump's victory.
Musk plans to give about $ 45 million a month, according to The Wall Street Journal. (Earlier this year, one leader of America PAC told a friend that an unnamed donor was likely to give as much as $ 160 million, The Times reports.) Musk had previously said that he wouldn't give to either Trump or Biden or a Republican super PAC.
Such a donation would shatter records, eclipsing the $ 50 million that the billionaire Timothy Mellon gave to a different pro-Trump super PAC.
That said, Musk responded to The Journal's story on his X social network with an illustration of wildebeests with human legs bearing the caption "FAKE GNUS."
America PAC has a bevy of high-profile backers. One key fund-raiser is Joe Lonsdale, the venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir who is one of Musk's close friends, people close to the organization told The Times.
Others include Antonio Gracias, a director at SpaceX and a former board member at Tesla; Ken Howery, a former Musk ally at PayPal; Doug Leone and Shaun Maguire, investors at Sequoia Capital; the Winklevoss twins; and Joe Craft, a coal magnate.
The super PAC stands to become a major political force. It collected about $ 8.8 million in the second quarter alone, and spent $ 15 million in recent weeks. Being able to tap even a fraction of Musk's estimated $ 252 billion fortune could give it formidable resources to organize support for the Trump campaign.
In other donation news: The billionaire financier Ken Griffin gave $ 10 million to Republicans' Congressional Leadership Fund, bringing his total giving to G.O.P. super PACs in this cycle to $ 25 million.
"A French wealth tax would increase French export of good entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley! Please go for it!"
-- Vinod Khosla , the venture capitalist, taking a swipe at speculation that French politicians will reinstate a wealth tax as part of negotiations to form a governing coalition in Parliament.
The Trump trade
The S&P 500 is up more than 18 percent this year, fueled by investor fervor for artificial intelligence and the hopes that the Fed will start cutting interest rates.
The calculation of a potential Donald Trump return to the White House could be another catalyst, analysts say.
Market watchers are calling it the return of "the Trump trade." This implies that Trump 2.0 would mean lower taxes, deregulation, increased oil drilling and more fiscal spending. "Equities saw a clear rotation into stocks that stand to benefit from Trump's policies," Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note on Tuesday.
The big winners on Monday included crypto stocks -- and digital assets like Bitcoin -- and oil majors. Trump Media, the former president's social media company that seems to ride the wave of Trump's political fortunes, also rose more than 30 percent.
Here's where investors put their money:
GEO Group and CoreCivic, two of the nation's largest publicly traded private prison operators, had their strongest days this year. The former gained more than 9 percent as investors weigh whether Trump's tough-on-crime campaign messaging will turn into policy that would bolster the sector.
The best performing sectors in the S&P 500 on Monday were energy and financials. The former, which includes Chevron and Exxon Mobil, climbed nearly 1.6 percent even as oil prices fell.
Coinbase, the crypto exchange, had its best day since March, gaining more than 10 percent, and Bitcoin nearly hit $ 65,000 before sinking. Trump appears to be warming to crypto as the industry gives millions to his campaign. The Republican Party platform is bullish too, vowing: "We will defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control."
Climate-related stocks were among the losers. "Trump has been openly hostile to environmental and climate regulation and the companies that might benefit from them," Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told DealBook. "Investors in those more volatile companies did not wait around to assess the probabilities of a Trump victory."
Worth noting: The S&P 500 is up roughly 48 percent since President Biden's inauguration day, one of the best market runs of the past century. Investors have concerns about both candidates, including that Biden would raise taxes that might sap corporate profits, and Trumponomics could mean a raft of inflationary tariffs that could hamper growth.

Microsoft's Bundling of Teams Is Antitrust Breach, E.U. Says: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech giant has been accused of stifling competition by packaging its video conferencing app with other tools like Word and Excel.
European Union regulators on Tuesday charged Microsoft with breaking antitrust rules by bundling its Teams video conferencing and collaboration software with a suite of other productivity tools, giving it an unfair advantage over rivals.
Regulators said Microsoft's packaging of Teams with other well-established software tools in Office 365 and Microsoft 365, which includes programs like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook, amounted to an illegal abuse of market dominance that rival companies like Zoom and Slack could not match. Regulators said businesses essentially had little choice but to take Teams if they wanted other software made by Microsoft.
The charges are just the latest in a barrage of announcements by the European Union in recent months in its effort to crack down on the world's largest tech platforms. On Monday, regulators accused Apple of violating competition rules because of its App Store policies. Amazon, Google, Meta, TikTok and X are also facing investigations related to their business practices and services.
The Microsoft case has its roots in the Covid-19 pandemic, when videoconferencing and collaboration tools like Zoom, Slack and Teams became essential for remote workforces. In 2020, Slack, now owned by Salesforce, complained to regulators that Microsoft's bundling of Teams with other productivity software was anticompetitive, setting off the initial E.U. investigation.
E.U. regulators said Microsoft had an unfair "distribution advantage" by not giving customers a choice of whether to buy Teams when purchasing other software. Rivals makers of videoconferencing tools also face challenges making their services work with other Microsoft software, regulators said.
"The conduct may have prevented Teams' rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers," the European Commission, the European Union's executive branch conducting the investigation, said in a statement.
The charges brought on Tuesday are one step in a long process. Microsoft can now respond to the complaint, but if the two sides do not reach an agreement, the company could face a fine of up to 10 percent of its annual global revenue.
The case has parallels to the antitrust charges brought decades ago by the U.S. Justice Department against Microsoft for bundling Internet Explorer inside its Windows operating system, a case that was eventually resolved.
On Tuesday, Microsoft said it had taken steps to resolve the dispute. Last year, Microsoft agreed to sell Teams separately from Office products.
"Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the commission's remaining concerns." Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, said in a statement.
The European Commission said Microsoft's changes were "insufficient" and called for more changes to be made to "restore competition," without specifying what those changes should be.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ilya Sutskever's new start-up, Safe Superintelligence, aims to build A.I. technologies that are smarter than a human but not dangerous.
Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist who in November joined other board members to force out Sam Altman, the company's high-profile chief executive, has helped found a new artificial intelligence company.
The new start-up is called Safe Superintelligence. It aims to produce superintelligence -- a machine that is more intelligent than humans -- in a safe way, according to the company spokeswoman Lulu Cheng Meservey.
Dr. Sutskever, who has said he regretted moving against Mr. Altman, declined to comment. The news was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
Dr. Sutskever, 38, left OpenAI last month and announced at the time that he would be starting a new project but did not provide details. Ms. Meservey declined to name who is funding the company or how much it has raised. She said that as it builds safe superintelligence, the company will not release other products.
Dr. Sutskever founded the company alongside Daniel Gross, who worked on A.I. at Apple, and Daniel Levy, who worked with Dr. Sutskever at OpenAI. Dr. Sutskever's title at the new company will be chief scientist but he describes his role, according to Ms. Meservey, as "responsible for revolutionary breakthroughs."
In November 2022, OpenAI captured the world's imagination with the release of ChatGPT, an online chatbot that could answer questions, write term papers, generate computer code and even mimic human conversation. The tech industry rapidly embraced what it called generative artificial intelligence: technologies that can generate text, images and other media.
Many experts believe these technologies are poised to remake everything from email programs to internet search engines and digital assistants. Some believe this transformation will have as big an impact as the web browser or the smartphone.
(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
Mr. Altman became the face of the movement toward generative A.I. as he met with lawmakers, regulators and investors around the world and testified before Congress. In November, Dr. Sutskever and three other OpenAI board members unexpectedly ousted him, saying they could no longer trust him with the company's plan to one day create a machine that can do anything the human brain can do.
Days later, after hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Dr. Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Mr. Altman. Mr. Altman returned as chief executive after he and the board agreed to replace two board members with Bret Taylor, a former Salesforce executive, and Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary. Dr. Sutskever effectively stepped down from the board.
Last year, Dr. Sutskever helped create what was called a Superalignment team inside OpenAI that aimed to ensure that future A.I. technologies would not do harm. Like others in the field, he had grown increasingly concerned that A.I. could become dangerous and perhaps even destroy humanity.
Jan Leike, who ran the Superalignment team alongside Dr. Sutskever, has also resigned from OpenAI. He has since been hired by OpenAI's competitor Anthropic, another company founded by former OpenAI researchers.

Lawmakers Question Microsoft Executive About Company's Presence in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Brad Smith testified before a House committee a year after Chinese hackers infiltrated Microsoft's technology and penetrated government networks.
Republican lawmakers questioned a senior Microsoft executive on Thursday about the company's presence in China, about a year after Chinese hackers used the tech giant's systems to launch a devastating hack of federal government networks.
Several members of the House Committee on Homeland Security asked Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, in an hourslong hearing how a critical contractor for the U.S. government like Microsoft could maintain a commercial business in China, which Mr. Smith said accounted for about 1.4 or 1.5 percent of the company's sales.
"Is it really worth it?" asked Representative Carlos Gimenez, a Republican from Florida.
Mr. Smith argued that Microsoft's business in China served American interests by protecting the trade secrets of Microsoft's American customers operating there and learning from what's going on in the rest of the world.
He added that Microsoft had denied Chinese government requests to turn over sensitive information. "I will tell you that there are days when questions are put to Microsoft, and they come across my desk, and I say, 'No,"' he said.
The hearing was a response to a scathing March report by the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Safety Review Board. The report detailed how "a cascade of security failures at Microsoft" allowed a hacking team called Storm-0558, which the report said was an espionage group affiliated with the Chinese government, to infiltrate Microsoft's email systems in May and June last year.
The report criticized Microsoft for having "a corporate culture that deprioritized both enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management" and said the company's cybersecurity practices were critical national security because "Microsoft's products and services are ubiquitous."
The hackers somehow obtained a digital key -- what the report called "cryptographic crown jewels" -- for Microsoft's security mechanisms that let them forge the credentials of other users. They compromised the accounts of 22 organizations and more than 500 individuals around the world, including Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo and the U.S. ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns. More than 60,000 emails were downloaded just from the computer network of the State Department, which discovered the breach.
The intrusion "should never have happened," the report said. It said Microsoft still did not even know how the hackers had obtained the digital key. It also chided Microsoft for making inaccurate public statements about the hack in the fall.
Microsoft has walked a delicate line in China. It has closed some businesses, such as the LinkedIn professional social network, but offers cloud computing services in China and houses engineering teams and a prized research lab there as well.
Mr. Smith said at the hearing that Microsoft had been shrinking its engineering presence in China and last month offered to relocate 700 or 800 employees who "were going to need to move out of China in order to keep their job."
The company's top executives, including Mr. Smith and the chief executive, Satya Nadella, have debated the future of the research lab and instituted guardrails that restrict researchers from politically sensitive work, The New York Times reported in January.
Mr. Smith pledged an urgent security effort inside Microsoft through what he called "the single largest cybersecurity engineering project in the history of digital technology."
Despite the tough report on Microsoft's security lapses, lawmakers at the hearing did not question Mr. Smith aggressively and instead focused on ways the government and private sector could work together.
"This is not a gotcha hearing," Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee's ranking Democrat, said in his opening remarks.
Mr. Smith stunned lawmakers when he described the scale of the challenge. He said Microsoft detected more than 300 million attacks a day on its customers.
Microsoft in January disclosed a separate hack, by a group sponsored by Russian intelligence, that the report did not cover.
In November, Microsoft announced a top-to-bottom overhaul of its security practices, its biggest security initiative in two decades, and in May said it would tie the compensation of its top executives to the overhaul's progress.
Mr. Smith said the company's board had approved a plan to tie a third of the individual performance bonuses for senior executives to cybersecurity. He also said all Microsoft employees would be evaluated on cybersecurity in their twice-a-year performance reviews.
Microsoft's competitors have pounced on its vulnerability. NetChoice, a trade group whose backers include Google, Amazon and Meta, released a poll of voters critiquing the government's reliance on Microsoft. NetChoice and several other trade groups backed by competitors sent letters to Biden administration officials calling for the government to use a wider variety of technology vendors.
A public relations firm that lists Google as a client regularly emails reporters when negative stories about Microsoft's hacks appear, at times offering up experts to speak with. This week, the business software company Salesforce sent a comment to reporters promoting its security culture.
Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, told investors in late April that security would be critical for customers that are choosing which A.I. services to use.
"If you just pay attention to what's been happening over the last year or two," he said, "not all the providers have the same track record."

Mistral Says It Has Raised $640 Million For A.I. Race: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Created by alumni from Meta and Google, Mistral is just a year old and has already raised more than $ 1 billion in total from investors, leading to eye-popping valuations.
Mistral, a French artificial intelligence start-up, said on Tuesday that it had raised 600 million euros, or about $ 640 million, from investors, a sign of robust interest in a company seen as Europe's most promising rival to OpenAI and other Silicon Valley A.I. developers.
Mistral is now valued at €5.8 billion, according to a person familiar with the investment, an eye-popping sum for a company founded just one year ago by alumni from Meta and Google. The company's valuation has roughly tripled since December, when it raised €385 million.
Investors in the latest round included the venture capital firms General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners, as well as Nvidia, Samsung, Salesforce, Cisco, IBM and BNP Paribas.
Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, investors have poured money into generative A.I. technology, which can answer questions in humanlike prose, create images and write software code. Two weeks ago, Elon Musk raised $ 6 billion for his start-up, xAI. OpenAI has raised roughly $ 13 billion from Microsoft, while another California start-up, Anthropic, has raised more than $ 7.3 billion.
Mistral has positioned itself as a European alternative to the larger American tech giants and boasts that its products, like the chatbot Le Chat, are strong in a wider range of languages, including English. In contrast to firms like OpenAI and Anthropic, Mistral subscribes to the view that A.I. software should be open source, meaning that the programming codes should be available for anyone to download, copy, tweak and repurpose. Meta has also made its A.I. code open source.
In a sign of A.I.'s growing geopolitical significance, President Emmanuel Macron and others in the French government have given the company their full-throated support. Mr. Macron has called Mistral a sign of "French genius" and invited the company's chief executive, Arthur Mensch, to dinner at the presidential palace.
On Tuesday, Mr. Mensch said in a statement that the latest investment would help keep the company independent and fuel its expansion.

Inside the Spectacular Flop Of a Bold A.I. Device: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Days before gadget reviewers weighed in on the Humane Ai Pin, a futuristic wearable device powered by artificial intelligence, the founders of the company gathered their employees and encouraged them to brace themselves. The reviews might be disappointing, they warned.
Humane's founders, Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri, were right. In April, reviewers brutally panned the new $ 699 product, which Humane had marketed for a year with ads and at glitzy events like Paris Fashion Week. The Ai Pin was "totally broken" and had "glaring flaws," some reviewers said. One declared it "the worst product I've ever reviewed."
About a week after the reviews came out, Humane started talking to HP, the computer and printer company, about selling itself for more than $ 1 billion, three people with knowledge of the conversations said. Other potential buyers have emerged, though talks have been casual and no formal sales process has begun.
Humane retained Tidal Partners, an investment bank, to help navigate the discussions while also managing a new funding round that would value it at $ 1.1 billion, three people with knowledge of the plans said.
The developments amount to a face-plant by Humane, which had positioned itself as a top contender among a wave of A.I. hardware makers. The San Francisco company had raised $ 240 million from powerful Silicon Valley investors, including Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, and Marc Benioff, Salesforce's chief executive, who valued the start-up at $ 1 billion based on its enormous ambition and promise. Humane spent five years building a device to disrupt the smartphone -- only to flounder.
As of early April, Humane had received around 10,000 orders for the Ai Pin, a small fraction of the 100,000 that it hoped to sell this year, two people familiar with its sales said. In recent months, the company has also grappled with employee departures and changed a return policy to address canceled orders. On Wednesday, it asked customers to stop using the Ai Pin charging case because of a fire risk associated with its battery.
Its setbacks are part of a pattern of stumbles across the world of generative A.I., as companies release unpolished products. Over the past two years, Google has introduced and pared back A.I. search abilities that recommended people eat rocks, Microsoft has trumpeted a Bing chatbot that hallucinated and Samsung has added A.I. features to a smartphone that were called "excellent at times and baffling at others."
In an interview, Ms. Bongiorno and Mr. Chaudhri, who are married, declined to comment on a possible sale or fund-raising for Humane. They said their ambitions for the Ai Pin had not changed, but they acknowledged that there was a difference between testing a device and actually using it.
"You don't know everything before you launch," Ms. Bongiorno said. Given the product reviews, Mr. Chaudhri said, they "definitely wish that we were able to resolve some of those things a little bit differently."
HP didn't respond to requests for comment.
This account of Humane is based on interviews with 23 current and former employees, advisers and investors, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter or feared retaliation. Bloomberg earlier reported on the start-up's potential sale.
Many current and former employees said Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno preferred positivity over criticism, leading them to disregard warnings about the Ai Pin's poor battery life and power consumption. A senior software engineer was dismissed after raising questions about the product, they said, while others left out of frustration.
Mr. Chaudhri said his company, which had 250 employees at its peak, encouraged workers to offer feedback. The departures were a natural consequence of transitioning from creating a new device to sustaining it after its release, which he said appealed to "a different type of person."
Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno, who both worked at Apple, started Humane in 2019. They set out to create a lapel pin that clips to clothing with a magnet. The device gives users access to an A.I.-powered virtual assistant that can send messages, search the web or take photos. It is complemented by a laser that projects text onto the palm of a user's hand for tasks like skipping a song while playing music. It also has a camera, a speaker and cellular service.
From the beginning, current and former employees said, the Ai Pin had issues, which reviewers later picked apart.
One was the device's laser display, which consumed tremendous power and would cause the pin to overheat. Before showing the gadget to prospective partners and investors, Humane executives often chilled it on ice packs so it would last longer, three people familiar with the demonstrations said. Those employees said such measures could be common early in a product development cycle.
When employees expressed concerns about the heat, they said, Humane's founders replied that software improvements reducing power use would fix it. Mr. Chaudhri, who led design, wanted to keep the gadget's sleek design, three people said.
The device's battery was not big enough to last long. Test units ran out of power within hours, current and former employees said. Humane decided to provide customers with a backup battery and charging case, which increased the product's price more than $ 100, two employees said.
The problems contributed to Humane's pushing back the date when it would ship the device to April from October, employees said.
Some employees tried persuading the founders not to launch the Ai Pin because it wasn't ready, three people said. Others repeatedly asked them to hire a head of marketing. The role remained vacant before the product's release.
In October, Time magazine named the Ai Pin one of the best inventions of 2023. The next month, Humane revealed the product's details, promoting it in commercials.
But orders were slower than expected, three people said, leading Humane to reduce plans to produce more of the devices. Ms. Bongiorno declined to comment on sales.
In January, Humane laid off about 10 employees. A month later, a senior software engineer was let go after she questioned whether the Ai Pin would be ready by April. In a company meeting after the dismissal, Mr. Chaudhri said the employee had violated policy by talking negatively about Humane, two attendees said.
Ms. Bongiorno said the company couldn't comment on individual employees.
The founders said they had spoken with several reviewers as they evaluated the device and responded to questions about their experiences, which included concerns about the Ai Pin's temperature and inaccurate responses to some requests.
On April 11, reviews in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Verge blasted the Ai Pin's shortcomings. Marques Brownlee, a tech reviewer on YouTube with 19 million subscribers, headlined his review "The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed ... for Now."
After the reviews, Ms. Bongiorno said, "we pulled the team together and we said: 'OK, look, this is going to be painful. We're going to have to lean into painful feedback."'
Ms. Bongiorno and Mr. Chaudhri said Humane had since worked on the device's issues. The start-up has added more voice navigation options to the device, as well as sound effects, to make it easier to use. The updates include integrating OpenAI's newest chatbot system, GPT-4o, and one that is set to improve battery life by 25 percent and cut the device's response time to two seconds.
Those updates have addressed the questions raised by reviewers, the founders said. Ms. Bongiorno referred to the reviews and feedback as "a gift that we've been given."
Businesses are interested in the device, she added. Within 48 hours of its launch, more than 1,000 companies -- including in retail, medicine and education -- reached out to discuss potentially working together or building software for the pin, Ms. Bongiorno said.
Humane also signed wireless carrier deals to expand the Ai Pin to South Korea and Japan.
Some discussions, including with HP, turned into talks about a potential sale, as well as licensing Humane's technology, three people with knowledge of the situation said. The conversations led Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno to hire Tidal Partners, an investment bank that had advised Cisco on its recent $ 28 billion acquisition of the cybersecurity business Splunk.
Those talks have continued as Humane dealt with its discovery that a battery supplier had provided components that could pose a fire risk. On Wednesday, it asked customers to stop using their charging case accessory while it worked to find a new vendor.
Humane had enough money to release its device, people close to the company said, but was trying to raise more.
"We just want to build," Ms. Bongiorno said.
Mr. Chaudhri added, "We have to look at how best we fund that."

Humane retained Tidal Partners, an investment bank, to help navigate the discussions while also managing a new funding round that would value it at $1.1 billion, three people with knowledge of the plans said.
The developments amount to a face-plant by Humane, which had positioned itself as a top contender among a wave of AI hardware makers. The San Francisco company had raised $240 million from powerful Silicon Valley investors, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who valued the startup at $1 billion based on its enormous ambition and promise. Humane spent five years building a device to disrupt the smartphone — only to founder.
As of early April, Humane had received about 10,000 orders for the Ai Pin, a small fraction of the 100,000 that it hoped to sell this year, two people familiar with its sales said. In recent months, the company has also grappled with employee departures and changed a return policy to address canceled orders. On Wednesday, it asked customers to stop using the Ai Pin charging case because of a fire risk associated with its battery.
Its setbacks are part of a pattern of stumbles across the world of generative AI as companies release unpolished products. Over the past two years, Google has introduced and pared back AI search abilities that recommended people eat rocks, Microsoft has trumpeted a Bing chatbot that hallucinated, and Samsung has added AI features to a smartphone that were called “excellent at times and baffling at others.”
In an interview, Bongiorno and Chaudhri, who are married, declined to comment on a possible sale or fundraising for Humane. They said their ambitions for the Ai Pin had not changed, but they acknowledged that there was a difference between testing a device and actually using it.
“You don’t know everything before you launch,” Bongiorno said. Given the product reviews, Chaudhri said, they “definitely wish that we were able to resolve some of those things a little bit differently.”
HP didn’t respond to requests for comment.
This account of Humane is based on interviews with 23 current and former employees, advisers and investors, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter or feared retaliation. Bloomberg earlier reported on the startup’s potential sale.
Many current and former employees said Chaudhri and Bongiorno preferred positivity over criticism, leading them to disregard warnings about the Ai Pin’s poor battery life and power consumption. A senior software engineer was dismissed after raising questions about the product, they said, while others left out of frustration.
Chaudhri said his company, which had 250 employees at its peak, encouraged workers to offer feedback. The departures were a natural consequence of transitioning from creating a new device to sustaining it after its release, which he said appealed to “a different type of person.”
Chaudhri and Bongiorno, who both worked at Apple, started Humane in 2019. They set out to create a lapel pin that clips to clothing with a magnet. The device gives users access to an AI-powered virtual assistant that can send messages, search the web or take photos. It is complemented by a laser that projects text onto the palm of a user’s hand for tasks such as skipping a song while playing music. It also has a camera, a speaker and cellular service.
From the beginning, current and former employees said, the Ai Pin had issues, which reviewers later picked apart.
One was the device’s laser display, which consumed tremendous power and would cause the pin to overheat. Before showing the gadget to prospective partners and investors, Humane executives often chilled it on ice packs so it would last longer, three people familiar with the demonstrations said. Those employees said such measures could be common early in a product development cycle.
When employees expressed concerns about the heat, they said, Humane’s founders replied that software improvements reducing power use would fix it. Chaudhri, who led design, wanted to keep the gadget’s sleek design, three people said.
The device’s battery was not big enough to last long. Test units ran out of power within hours, current and former employees said. Humane decided to provide customers with a backup battery and charging case, which increased the product’s price more than $100, two employees said.
The problems contributed to Humane’s pushing back the date when it would ship the device to April from October, employees said.
Some employees tried persuading the founders not to launch the Ai Pin because it wasn’t ready, three people said. Others repeatedly asked them to hire a head of marketing. The role remained vacant before the product’s release.
In October, Time magazine named the Ai Pin one of the best inventions of 2023. The next month, Humane revealed the product’s details, promoting it in commercials.
But orders were slower than expected, three people said, leading Humane to reduce plans to produce more of the devices. Bongiorno declined to comment on sales.
In January, Humane laid off about 10 employees. A month later, a senior software engineer was let go after she questioned whether the Ai Pin would be ready by April. In a company meeting after the dismissal, Chaudhri and Bongiorno said the employee had violated policy by talking negatively about Humane, two attendees said.
Bongiorno said the company couldn’t comment on individual employees.
The founders said they had spoken with several reviewers as they evaluated the device and responded to questions about their experiences, which included concerns about the Ai Pin’s temperature and inaccurate responses to some requests.
On April 11, reviews in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Verge blasted the Ai Pin’s shortcomings. Marques Brownlee, a tech reviewer on YouTube with 19 million subscribers, headlined his review “The Worst Product I’ve Ever Reviewed … for Now.”
After the reviews, Bongiorno said, “we pulled the team together, and we said, ‘OK, look, this is going to be painful. We’re going to have to lean into painful feedback.’”
Bongiorno and Chaudhri said Humane had since worked on the device’s issues. The startup has added more voice navigation options to the device, as well as sound effects, to make it easier to use. The updates include integrating OpenAI’s newest chatbot system, GPT-4o, and one that is set to improve battery life by 25% and cut the device’s response time to two seconds.
Those updates have addressed the questions raised by reviewers, the founders said. Bongiorno referred to the reviews and feedback as “a gift that we’ve been given.”
Businesses are interested in the device, she added. Within 48 hours of its launch, more than 1,000 companies — including in retail, medicine and education — reached out to discuss potentially working together or building software for the pin, Bongiorno said.
Humane also signed wireless carrier deals to expand the Ai Pin to South Korea and Japan.
Some discussions, including with HP, turned into talks about a potential sale, as well as licensing Humane’s technology, three people with knowledge of the situation said. The conversations led Chaudhri and Bongiorno to hire Tidal Partners, which had advised Cisco on its recent $28 billion acquisition of cybersecurity business Splunk.
Those talks have continued as Humane dealt with its discovery that a battery supplier had provided components that could pose a fire risk. On Wednesday, it asked customers to stop using their charging case accessory while it worked to find a new vendor.
Humane had enough money to release its device, people close to the company said, but was trying to raise more.
“We just want to build,” Bongiorno said.
Chaudhri added, “We have to look at how best we fund that.”

Big Tech Stumbles Drag Indexes Lower Despite Widespread Rises: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Most U.S. stocks rose Thursday, but indexes nevertheless stumbled because of sharp drops for some influential technology giants. Salesforce dropped to its worst day in nearly 20 years.
The S&P 500 sank 31.47 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,235.48, even though the majority of stocks within the index and across Wall Street were higher. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 330.06, or 0.9 percent, to 38,111.48, and the Nasdaq composite lost 183.50, or 1.1 percent, to 16,737.08.
Salesforce, which helps businesses manage their customers, lost nearly a fifth of its value after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The cloud-based software company also gave forecasts for revenue in the current quarter and fiscal year that fell short of Wall Street's. Shares tumbled 19.7 percent.
Kohl's fell even more, 22.9 percent, after reporting a surprise loss for the latest quarter when analysts were expecting to see a profit. The retailer said sales fell from a year earlier as customers pulled back on clearance items. It cut its forecasts for sales this year because of the stumble.
And Nvidia finally ran out of momentum after blowing past analysts' expectations in its latest profit report, which fed more fuel into Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Nvidia sank 3.8 percent for its first drop since soaring more than 20 percent following its profit report last week. The chip company was an even heavier weight on the S&P 500 than Salesforce.
Helping to support the market were better-than-expected profit reports from a range of companies. Best Buy topped forecasts even though its revenue fell short last quarter, and its stock rose 13.4 percent. Foot Locker ran 15 percent higher after likewise reporting better-than-expected profit despite ringing up sales shy of analysts' forecasts.
Stocks also broadly got a boost from easing Treasury yields in the bond market. That helped most stocks on Wall Street to climb, and the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index rallied 1 percent.
The drop in yields offered relief after they had climbed earlier this week on worries about tepid demand for Treasury bonds following several U.S. government auctions. Higher yields put downward pressure on all kinds of investments.
Yields fell Thursday after a couple reports showed the U.S. economy isn't quite as strong as expected. The hope on Wall Street is that the economy can cool down, but not by too much, so that the Federal Reserve can hit a precise landing where it gets high inflation under control without causing a bad recession.
One report showed more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected, though the number of layoffs still remains low compared with history. Another suggested the overall U.S. economy's growth may not have been quite as strong as earlier thought.
A slowdown in the economy could give the Federal Reserve more confidence that inflation is sustainably heading down to its 2 percent target. That in turn could convince it to cut the federal funds rate, which has been sitting at the highest level in more than two decades.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.55 percent from 4.62 percent late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell to 4.92 percent from 4.98 percent.
The more important data point will likely arrive Friday, when the U.S. government offers the latest monthly update on a gauge of inflation that the Federal Reserve prefers to use. That report "could dominate market sentiment until next Friday's jobs report," according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.
Until then, the tail end of earnings reporting season could offer the main drivers for the market. Profits have largely been better than expected for the start of 2024.

Full text: In November, Ilya Sutskever joined three other OpenAI board members to force out Sam Altman, the chief executive, before saying he regretted the move.
Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist who in November joined three other board members to force out Sam Altman, the company's high-profile chief executive, before saying he regretted the move, is leaving the San Francisco A.I. company.
Dr. Sutskever's departure, which the company announced in a blog post on Tuesday, closes another chapter in a story that stunned Silicon Valley and that raised questions about whether Mr. Altman and his company were prepared to lead the tech industry into the age of artificial intelligence.
After returning to OpenAI just five days after he was ousted, Mr. Altman reasserted his control and continued its push toward increasingly powerful technologies that worried some of his critics. Dr. Sutskever remained an OpenAI employee, but he never returned to work.
"This is an emotional day for all of us," Mr. Altman said in an interview. "OpenAI would not exist without him and certainly was shaped by him."
In a statement, Dr. Sutskever said: "I have made the decision to leave OpenAI. The company's trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous, and I'm confident that OpenAI will build A.G.I. that is both safe and beneficial." A.G.I., or artificial general intelligence, is an as-yet-unbuilt technology that can do anything the brain can do.
Dr. Sutskever, 38, added that he was starting a new project, but did not elaborate.
A key OpenAI researcher, Jakub Pachocki, will replace Dr. Sutskever as chief scientist at the company, which is valued at more than $ 80 billion, according to a recent fund-raising deal.
On Monday, OpenAI unveiled a new version of its ChatGPT chatbot that can receive and respond to voice commands, images and videos, joining tech giants like Google and Apple in a race toward a new kind of talking digital assistant.
Founded in 2015 by Mr. Altman, Elon Musk and several young researchers, including Dr. Sutskever, OpenAI has long been at the forefront of A.I. research. Dr. Sutskever's involvement provided the company with instant credibility. As a graduate student at the University of Toronto, he had been part of an A.I. breakthrough involving neural networks -- the technology that has driven the field's progress over the last decade.
In late 2022, OpenAI wowed the world with the release of ChatGPT, an online chatbot that could answer questions, write poetry, generate computer code and chat a lot like people. The tech industry quickly embraced what is called generative artificial intelligence -- technologies that can generate text, images and other media on their own.
The result of more than a decade of research inside companies like OpenAI and Google, generative A.I. is poised to remake everything from email programs to internet search engines and digital assistants.
Mr. Altman became a spokesman for the shift toward generative A.I., testifying before Congress and meeting with lawmakers, regulators and investors around the world. In November, OpenAI's board of directors unexpectedly ousted him, saying he could no longer be trusted with the company's plan to eventually create artificial general intelligence.
The OpenAI board had six people: three founders and three independent members. Dr. Sutskever voted with the three outsiders to remove Mr. Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board, saying -- without providing specifics -- that Mr. Altman had not been "consistently candid in his communications."
Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president and another co-founder, resigned from the company in protest. So did Dr. Pachocki.
Days later, as hundreds of OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Dr. Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Mr. Altman and effectively stepped down from the board, leaving three independent members in opposition to Mr. Altman.
Mr. Altman returned as chief executive after he and the board agreed to replace two members with Bret Taylor, a former Salesforce executive, and Lawrence Summers, a former U.S. Treasury secretary. Mr. Altman regained his board seat several months later, as the board expanded to seven people.
Last year, Dr. Sutskever helped create a Super Alignment team inside OpenAI to explore ways of ensuring that future versions of the technology would not do harm. Like others in the field, he had grown increasingly concerned that A.I. could become dangerous and perhaps even destroy humanity.
Jan Leike, who ran the Super Alignment team alongside Dr. Sutskever, has also resigned from OpenAI. His role will be taken by John Schulman, another company co-founder.
In the weeks leading up to Mr. Altman's ouster, Dr. Pachocki, who helped oversee the creation of GPT-4, the technology at the heart of ChatGPT, was promoted to director of research at the company. After occupying a position below Dr. Sutskever, he was elevated to a position alongside him, two people familiar with the moves said.
After Mr. Altman was reinstated, Dr. Sutskever did not return to work. Mr. Altman indicated that he was hoping to negotiate his return, but ultimately that was not possible.
Dr. Pachocki has effectively served as chief scientist since November. After Dr. Sutskever recruited him and others to join OpenAI, he was among the key researchers on several of the company's most important projects, including, most notably, GPT-4.
"I am grateful to Ilya," Dr. Pachocki said in an interview. "We have different and in many ways complementary styles of leadership."
Mr. Altman said he talked with Dr. Sutskever on Tuesday. "He has pushed us -- and will continue to push us -- to, as he says, feel the A.G.I.," Mr. Altman said.

Relationships Can Be Tricky. Would Software Help Out?: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Some couples are using professional project-management software to maintain their relationships. Why does it bother other people?
Ben Lang didn't expect to get so much hate just for being organized. For the past three years, he and his wife, Karen-Lynn Amouyal, have been using Notion, a popular software tool, to optimize their household and relationship. His version of the tool, commonly used by businesses to manage complex projects, functions like a souped-up Google Doc, with sections for a grocery list, to-do lists and details of upcoming trips.
More unusual is a section Mr. Lang, a venture capital investor who previously worked at Notion, created about principles ("what's important to us as a couple"). Another section, called "Learnings," outlines things the couple have discovered about each other, such as their love languages and Myers-Briggs test results. There's a list of friends they want to set up on dates. They also maintain a log of memories from their date nights. Mr. Lang, 30, was so proud of the creation that last month, he started promoting a template of the setup to others. "My wife and I use Notion religiously to manage our day-to-day life," he wrote on X. "I turned this into a template, let me know if you'd like to see it!"
The internet responded with a venomous outrage. "People have told me my wife is cheating on me, people have told me I have a dead body in my basement, people have told me I'm autistic," he said.
But his approach isn't entirely unusual, especially among people who work in the tech industry and want to manage their personal lives the same way they manage their professional lives. For a class of young workers, it's only rational to apply the tools of the corporate world to their relationships and families. Businesses have goals and systems for achieving them, the thinking goes. They get things done.
Anastasia Alt, 35, uses Kanban boards -- a visual tracking system where tasks progress from left to right -- in Trello, a project management tool, for "literally everything." This includes work at Yana Sleep, her e-commerce start-up, but also planning trips and events with her partner. The two of them also have a dedicated Slack work space, named after a mash-up of their surnames with a logo created using the artificial intelligence software Midjourney. She acknowledged, in jest, that some of her systems were "a little psychopathic," but said she's always been an optimizer.
Ms. Alt said the Slack work space has emotional benefits for her relationship, too: freeing up their text messages and in-person conversations for the fun stuff.
"I'm glad, when the workday is over, that I don't need to address 20 minutes' worth of semi-urgent logistical items before diving into eating takeout food and hanging out with our dogs," she said. "Sitting in person and hashing out a schedule together is less high-quality time than sitting in person and, you know, telling jokes."
A #gratitude channel, where the couple posts messages of appreciation or acknowledgment of what the other person is doing, has become a repository of memories she likes to look back on, almost like a photo album, she said.
Lessons From Business
Relationships are work, but no one wants to admit it.
But this particular flavor of life hacking often causes observers to collectively recoil. It threatens to take the romance and spontaneity out of life, in their view. It feels cold.
"There is a phenomenon whereby the more you try to manage your life, the more you risk squeezing the vibrancy out of it," said Oliver Burkeman, author of "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals."
And yet, the crushing overwhelm of modern life, with daily to-do lists and schedules and notifications and digital logistics can feel so never-ending that any solution offering to optimize even the tiniest task -- or most meaningful relationship -- looks like a lifeline worth grasping for.
Emily Oster, a parenting expert and economist, rose to popularity by promoting a data-based approach to managing pregnancy, including in her latest book "The Unexpected." She also wrote a book in 2021 called "The Family Firm," which advises using a "business process" to make family decisions about, for instance, extracurriculars or getting your kid a phone. Some critics have attacked her approach for the same reasons they recoil from a Notion template for married couples -- it can feel detached.
Dr. Oster said the problem is not systems like hers -- it's not having difficult conversations about priorities and principles. Her spreadsheets and other tools are designed to set people up for the lives they want, she said.
"Surfacing conflict on purpose is something we don't generally like to do," she said. "It's hard to do at work, also, but it's even harder to do with someone you want go to sleep with at night."
Dr. Oster said the lesson she takes from the business world to her personal life is to make thoughtful, deliberate decisions. "I don't think there is a limit to how far you can take that," she said.
She's not alone in that thinking. Even amid the backlash to Mr. Lang's template, more than 2,400 people liked it enough to download a copy, with an option to pay up to $ 25.
'They Are Craving a Solution'
Claire Kart, 40, was among those who bought the template, in part, she said, because she was amused by all the jokes about it. But also, with two kids under the age of 3, the allure of a better, more productive, more organized way of life at home was irresistible.
Ms. Kart, a marketing executive at a cryptocurrency start-up, already has some optimization systems in place with her husband, a start-up founder. They use Google's Keep app for a shared grocery list and Google calendars to manage their schedule. She has elaborately color-coded Google Sheets for Christmas gifts and vacation planning. (She calls herself the family's chief creative officer, as well as chief investment officer. Her husband is the chief financial officer and chief technology officer.)
Ms. Kart said systems like hers were necessary for splitting up household management duties. One person can keep everything in their head, she said, but "dividing and co-owning that work" leads to "coordination friction."
Like Ms. Alt, she believes the systems free up their limited in-person time for more meaningful conversations. "Using that really rare time to talk about a grocery list feels lonely," she said.
Since her second child was born a little over a year ago, Ms. Kart and her husband have been "cutting scope," she said, using a project management phrase for doing less. "We're in survival mode," she said. "Just cooking dinner feels like a win."
Mr. Lang's template could help, she said. The only problem so far? She's been too busy to set it up.
A smaller subset of people have always used tech tools in their personal lives, but the practice has spread in recent years. Mei Lin Ng, the co-founder of the family tech start-up, Hearth, said that one reason past attempts to create technology for the family have failed was that consumers weren't as open to it. Her company's product, a 27-inch screen that families can mount in their homes to display schedules, assign chores and help kids with morning and bedtime routines that became available last year, is being adopted by digitally native millennials.
"Consumers are really, really ready for something like this," she said. "They are craving a solution."
After Ms. Alt told her friend and fellow optimizer, Ryan Matzner, about her couples' Slack, he immediately started his own. It was a bit of an uphill battle to get his fiancée, Kate McKenzie, on board -- she is a medical school student and preferred analog tools like a paper planner -- but they're now using Trello, Slack and a shared Google calendar to plan their wedding.
Mr. Matzner, 39, co-founder of a product development agency called Fueled, realized that he had been avoiding responding to text messages from Ms. McKenzie because their thread had turned into a to-do list full of tasks.
So they dumped all their administrative tasks into Slack, which has expanded beyond wedding planning into regular life with more than 40 channels including #house-parties, #travel and #ludwig-the-car.
Being hyper-organized and efficient is a natural outgrowth of having a very active work and social life, Mr. Matzner said. He sends calendar invites the minute he makes plans and saves new friends into his contacts with their city -- searchable anytime he's in town -- as well as a note if they'd be fun to invite to a dinner party. He wishes someone would build a "personal C.R.M." (customer relationship management, the kind of system sold by companies like Salesforce), since none of the options he's tried are entirely satisfying.
Being the organized person in a relationship can lead to friction. Kate Reznykova, 27, a venture capital investor, used to frequently field random queries like, "How do we log into our internet?" from her partner throughout the day, which tested her patience. She recently started using Mr. Lang's Notion template to establish a "shared source of truth" for such questions. "If I get a text, I say, 'Go to the page, it's all there,"' she said.
Mr. Lang was amused by the attention his template got online. There were memes about divorce rates spiking in San Francisco, about "offboarding" one's wife and about requiring your partner to submit a "purchase order approval form" to spend money. He posted his own joke version, with quarterly objectives and annual reviews for relationships.
He and Ms. Amouyal used Notion to plan their wedding -- a life event that, anecdotally, seems to turn many couples into project managers -- and decided to keep it going after their honeymoon. The most hated part of his template, the date night log, was simply a way to follow all the marriage advice he kept hearing, he said. Everyone told him how important it was to keep the connection strong as life gets busier and more complicated. Why not create a journal of all the fun things they've done together? The outsized reaction was a surprise.
"I thought a few people would respond and think it's cute," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Natalie Joy sent Nick Viall a direct message on Instagram in 2019, she said she had no idea about his run on reality TV. About a year after meeting in person, their casual arrangement got serious.
Nick Joseph Viall is used to his dating life being on public display. From 2014 to 2017, he appeared in four seasons of the "Bachelor" franchise: two seasons of "The Bachelorette," one season of "Bachelor in Paradise" and, finally, "The Bachelor."
That's all experience that has helped inform his relationship podcast, "The Viall Files," and his 2022 book, "Don't Text Your Ex Happy Birthday: And Other Advice on Love, Sex and Dating."
But his relationship with Natalie Joy, whom he began dating in 2019, remained out of the public eye for several years. On April 27, the couple exchanged vows on an animal farm in Savannah, Ga.
They met in September 2019, when one of Mr. Viall's Instagram photos popped up on Ms. Joy's Explore page. She thought he was attractive, so she decided to send him a cheeky message: "You're unreal."
Though he doesn't usually respond to DMs, Ms. Joy, 25, stood out, he said, adding that he thought she was "a very beautiful woman" and was "intrigued." They started talking on the phone and texting, but they weren't sure if they would ever actually cross paths in person. At the time, Mr. Viall, 43, was living in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, and Ms. Joy was living in Savannah, where she grew up.
In October 2019, Mr. Viall traveled to New York for a work engagement. (He had been an account executive at Salesforce before first appearing on "The Bachelorette" in 2014 and eventually transitioning to author, podcast host and media personality.)
Ms. Joy, who had lived in New York for two years after dropping out of high school at 15 to pursue a modeling career, flew to New York as well. The plan was to meet him in person while also catching up with old friends.
They met at what was then called the Williamsburg Hotel, had dinner and drinks and walked around Brooklyn. She had such a great time that she spent the whole weekend with him and ended up "ghosting" her friends, she said.
Neither expected much from their weekend together. "Here I was meeting a girl who lives in Savannah," Mr. Viall said. "She's meeting some guy who lives in L.A. That's not necessarily a recipe for starting a relationship per se."
But he was surprised by how much they connected, and he wanted her to meet two of his closest friends: Sharleen Joynt, a contestant on the 18th season of "The Bachelor," and her husband, Andy Levine. Mr. Viall has known the couple since 2015, and they ultimately ended up leading the wedding ceremony on Saturday.
"I really value their opinion, and they're pretty honest friends, so I was curious about what they thought of Natalie," Mr. Viall said. "And they loved her instantly."
Ms. Joynt and Mr. Levine remember meeting Ms. Joy over dinner at Ferns, a restaurant in the East Village. Mr. Viall had been their "go-to third wheel," Ms. Joynt said. They had been an established group of three. But Ms. Joy "was such an effortless addition to our group," Ms. Joynt said.
About a week later, Ms. Joy accepted an invitation to visit him in Los Angeles. They lounged on the beach in Venice, walked along the boardwalk, and enjoyed each other's company. They indulged in the day-to-day activities. "It didn't really matter what we did," Ms. Joy said.
For the next 10 months, Mr. Viall and Ms. Joy met in Los Angeles, New York or Savannah about once a month.
At first, Ms. Joy leaned into the casual nature of their relationship and decided to just have fun with him. She was being realistic, she said, knowing that they lived far from each other. But as time progressed, she wanted something more serious.
About four months after they started seeing each other, she told him that. "Nick politely declined," Ms. Joy said. He had been single for a while and was hesitant to enter a relationship. (As for their age difference, Mr. Viall has said that it initially "was something I was self-conscious about.")

Nevertheless, Mr. Viall still wanted to spend time with her. "Every time she left, I just always would miss her," he said.
When the pandemic struck in March 2020, Ms. Joy flew to Los Angeles and stayed with Mr. Viall for a week. It was the most time they had spent together -- that week they really got to know each other. "Up to that point, it was always like a weekend here and a weekend there," Mr. Viall said.
After a week, she decided to return to Savannah, where her family was and where she was working as a surgical technologist for a reconstructive surgeon at Georgia Institute for Plastic Surgery. "I remember being bummed out," Mr. Viall said.
Ms. Joy was standing her ground. She set boundaries and made sure she wasn't investing too much time and energy into Mr. Viall, because she knew she wanted a relationship, and he was not offering that to her. But she had a feeling that he would eventually come around.
"I feel like the reason I stuck around for so long is because I genuinely always knew it was him, and I just knew he would come around at some point," Ms. Joy said. "Every time I was with him, I felt at home. I felt super safe and protected."
She didn't wait around for him, though, and she continued to date other people.
One day that summer, he FaceTimed her as she was getting ready for a date, and he asked her what she was getting ready for. She told him the truth. "I didn't have the right to get mad," Mr. Viall said. "I was more frustrated with myself. And I respected her for sticking to her guns."
Ms. Joy became less and less available -- answering his calls less often and responding to his texts slower.
"I wasn't fully giving her everything she deserved at the time," Mr. Viall said. "She wasn't going to stick around for something that was less conventional. Which I obviously always respected about her and, you know, made me really have to think long and hard about what was important to me."
"I finally realized that even though I had my fears -- you can always think of reasons not to do something that you're worried about -- that wasn't worth losing her," Mr. Viall added. "And so I kind of got over my insecurities or fears."
While she was on a trip to Puerto Rico in July 2020 with her sister, he texted her and asked if they could talk. He wanted to work it out. And he told her that he loved her.
After her trip, Ms. Joy visited him in Los Angeles, and the two became exclusive. Around the same time, Mr. Viall was looking for houses in L.A.
"I remember him telling me, 'I'm looking at these houses, and I'm picturing you in them with me,"' Ms. Joy said. She moved into his new home in Valley Village in November 2020.
"In Natalie's presence, Nick is more relaxed," Ms. Joynt said. The couple did their first joint interview in July 2021 on Ms. Joynt and Mr. Levine's podcast "Dear Shandy."
"It was really sacred to him," Ms. Joynt said about their relationship. "Once you make something public, there's a lot out of your control. And I think it speaks to how precious he saw this relationship, that he wanted to keep it as private as he did."
Ms. Joynt added that she and Mr. Levine had met other women Mr. Viall had dated. And they had heard about many others. But, "most of them never got past the starting point." (Mr. Viall had become engaged on his season of "The Bachelor," but the engagement ended later that year.)
In January 2023, Mr. Viall proposed by organizing a fake movie screening for Tom Hanks's film "A Man Called Otto." He convinced her they would be attending by making a fake flier with details including the address and dress code, and booked a venue in Venice, Create Studios. Mr. Viall even hired extras who stood in line with her to enter the venue. When she entered, though, the floor was decorated with 200 candles, and a big screen in the back of the room began playing a prerecorded video of Mr. Viall speaking to the camera.
"Thank you for falling in love with me and making me feel safe enough to fall in love with you," Mr. Viall said in the video, while crying. "I know when we first met, I was a tough nut to crack. It probably felt like it was tough to get me to open up. So thank you so much for being patient with me."
"Look up by the stairs," Mr. Viall said in the video. There he was in the flesh, walking down the staircase to propose.
In February, the couple welcomed their daughter, River Rose Viall. Mr. Viall, who grew up in Milwaukee, graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a bachelor's degree in accounting and supply chain management. In addition to his podcast, which is under his media company, Envy Media, Mr. Viall is a host and relationship expert on the unscripted show, "Patti Stanger: The Matchmaker."
Ms. Joy, who returned to high school and graduated, received a degree in surgical technology from Savannah Technical College. She currently works as a surgical technologist for Dr. Mehryar Ray Taban, an ocular facial surgeon based in Beverly Hills. She is also a regular on "The Viall Files."
On April 27, the couple were wed before 164 guests at Magnolia Farm and Stables, an animal farm in Savannah owned by Ms. Joy's sister. Mr. Levine, who was ordained through the American Marriage Ministries for the occasion, led the ceremony, with Ms. Joynt taking part.
The theme of the wedding was "Vogue on the farm," Mr. Viall said. "Very posh, very elegant, but it's on an animal farm," Ms. Joy added.
JoJo Siwa, Josh Peck, the actor formerly of "Drake & Josh," and Katie Maloney from "Vanderpump Rules" were among the guests. Ms. Joy wore a gown by Macye Wysner of Cinq, while Mr. Viall was gifted a tuxedo by Hugo Boss for the ceremony.
The couple had a "country chic" welcome party the Friday before the wedding, leaning into Ms. Joy's Southern roots with a mechanical bull, a vat of boiled peanuts and lots of cowboy hats, suede, fringe and denim.
The theme was unrelated to the current cowboy hype: "I've rode horses for a while. That farm has been in my family for a while," Ms. Joy said. "Natalie's always been a bit of a country girl," Mr. Viall added.

New A.I. Technology Generates Blueprint To Edit Human DNA: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Generative A.I. technologies can write poetry and computer programs or create images of teddy bears and videos of cartoon characters that look like something from a Hollywood movie.
Now, new A.I. technology is generating blueprints for microscopic biological mechanisms that can edit your DNA, pointing to a future when scientists can battle illness and diseases with even greater precision and speed than they can today.
Described in a research paper published on Monday by a Berkeley, Calif., startup called Profluent, the technology is based on the same methods that drive ChatGPT, the online chatbot that launched the A.I. boom after its release in 2022. The company is expected to present the paper next month at the annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.
Much as ChatGPT learns to generate language by analyzing Wikipedia articles, books and chat logs, Profluent's technology creates new gene editors after analyzing enormous amounts of biological data, including microscopic mechanisms that scientists already use to edit human DNA.
These gene editors are based on Nobel Prize-winning methods involving biological mechanisms called CRISPR. Technology based on CRISPR is already changing how scientists study and fight illness and disease, providing a way of altering genes that cause hereditary conditions, such as sickle cell anemia and blindness.
Previously, CRISPR methods used mechanisms found in nature -- biological material gleaned from bacteria that allows these microscopic organisms to fight off germs.
"They have never existed on Earth," said James Fraser, a professor and chair of the department of bioengineering and therapeutic sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, who has read Profluent's research paper. "The system has learned from nature to create them, but they are new."
The hope is that the technology will eventually produce gene editors that are more nimble and more powerful than those that have been honed over billions of years of evolution.
On Monday, Profluent also said that it had used one of these A.I.-generated gene editors to edit human DNA and that it was "open sourcing" this editor, called OpenCRISPR-1. That means it is allowing individuals, academic labs and companies to experiment with the technology for free.
A.I. researchers often open source the underlying software that drives their A.I. systems, because it allows others to build on their work and accelerate the development of new technologies. But it is less common for biological labs and pharmaceutical companies to open source inventions like OpenCRISPR-1.
Though Profluent is open sourcing the gene editors generated by its A.I. technology, it is not open sourcing the A.I. technology itself.
The project is part of a wider effort to build A.I. technologies that can improve medical care. Scientists at the University of Washington, for instance, are using the methods behind chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and image generators like Midjourney to create entirely new proteins -- the microscopic molecules that drive all human life -- as they work to accelerate the development of new vaccines and medicines.
(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, on claims of copyright infringement involving artificial intelligence systems that generate text.)
Generative A.I. technologies are driven by what scientists call a neural network, a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing vast amounts of data. The image creator Midjourney, for example, is underpinned by a neural network that has analyzed millions of digital images and the captions that describe each of those images. The system learned to recognize the links between the images and the words. So when you ask it for an image of a rhinoceros leaping off the Golden Gate Bridge, it knows what to do.
Profluent's technology is driven by a similar A.I. model that learns from sequences of amino acids and nucleic acids -- the chemical compounds that define the microscopic biological mechanisms that scientists use to edit genes. Essentially, it analyzes the behavior of CRISPR gene editors pulled from nature and learns how to generate entirely new gene editors.
"These A.I. models learn from sequences -- whether those are sequences of characters or words or computer code or amino acids," said Profluent's chief executive, Ali Madani, a researcher who previously worked in the A.I. lab at the software giant Salesforce.
Profluent has not yet put these synthetic gene editors through clinical trials, so it is not clear if they can match or exceed the performance of CRISPR. But this proof of concept shows that A.I. models can produce something capable of editing the human genome.
Still, it is unlikely to affect health care in the short term. Fyodor Urnov, a gene editing pioneer and scientific director at the Innovative Genomics Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, said scientists had no shortage of naturally occurring gene editors that they could use to fight illness and disease. The bottleneck, he said, is the cost of pushing these editors through preclinical studies, such as safety, manufacturing and regulatory reviews, before they can be used on patients.
But generative A.I. systems often hold enormous potential because they tend to improve quickly as they learn from increasingly large amounts of data. If technology like Profluent's continues to improve, it could eventually allow scientists to edit genes in far more precise ways. The hope, Dr. Urnov said, is that this could, in the long term, lead to a world where medicines and treatments are quickly tailored to individual people even faster than we can do today.
"I dream of a world where we have CRISPR on demand within weeks," he said.
Scientists have long cautioned against using CRISPR for human enhancement because it is a relatively new technology that could potentially have undesired side effects, such as triggering cancer, and have warned against unethical uses, such as genetically modifying human embryos.
This is also a concern with synthetic gene editors. But scientists already have access to everything they need to edit embryos.
"A bad actor, someone who is unethical, is not worried about whether they use an A.I.-created editor or not," Dr. Fraser said. "They are just going to go ahead and use what's available."

A.I. David From Europe Eyes Goliaths: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mistral, a French start-up considered a promising challenger to OpenAI and Google, is getting support from European leaders who want to protect the region's culture and politics.
Arthur Mensch, tall and lean with a flop of unkempt hair, arrived for a speech last month at a sprawling tech hub in Paris wearing jeans and carrying a bicycle helmet. He had an unassuming look for a person European officials are counting on to help propel the region into a high-stakes match with the United States and China over artificial intelligence.
Mr. Mensch, 31, is the chief executive and a founder of Mistral, considered by many to be one of the most promising challengers to OpenAI and Google. "You have become the poster child for A.I. in France," Matt Clifford, a British investor, told him onstage.
A lot is riding on Mr. Mensch, whose company has shot into the spotlight just a year after he founded it in Paris with two college friends. As Europe scrambles to get a foothold in the A.I. revolution, the French government has singled out Mistral as its best hope to create a standard-bearer, and has lobbied European Union policymakers to help ensure the firm's success.
Artificial intelligence will be built rapidly into the global economy in the coming decade, and policymakers and business leaders in Europe fear that growth and competitiveness will suffer if the region does not keep up. Behind their worries is a conviction that A.I. should not be dominated by tech giants, like Microsoft and Google, that might forge global standards at odds with the culture and politics of other countries. At stake is the bigger question of which artificial intelligence models will wind up influencing the world, and how they should be regulated.
"The issue with not having a European champion is that the road map gets set by the United States," said Mr. Mensch, who just 18 months ago was working as an engineer at Google's DeepMind lab in Paris, building A.I. models. His co-founders, Timothée Lacroix and Guillaume Lample, also in their 30s, held similar positions at Meta.
In an interview at Mistral's spartan, whitewashed offices facing the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris, Mr. Mensch said it "wasn't safe to trust" U.S. tech giants to set ground rules for a powerful new technology that would affect millions of lives.
"We can't have a strategic dependency," he said. "That's why we want to make a European champion."
Europe has struggled to produce meaningful tech companies since the dot-com boom. As the United States turned out Google, Meta and Amazon, and China produced Alibaba, Huawei and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, Europe's digital economy failed to deliver, according to a report by France's Artificial Intelligence Commission. The 15-member committee -- which includes Mr. Mensch -- warned that Europe was lagging on A.I., but said it had the potential to take a lead.
Mistral's generative A.I. technology allows businesses to launch chatbots, search functions and other A.I.-driven products. It has surprised many by building a model that rivals the technology developed at OpenAI, the U.S. start-up that ignited the A.I. boom in 2022 with the ChatGPT chatbot. Named after a powerful wind in France, Mistral has rapidly gained ground by developing a more flexible and cost-efficient machine-learning tool. Some big European firms are beginning to use its technology, including Renault, the French auto giant, and BNP Paribas, the financial services company.
The French government is giving Mistral its full-throated support. President Emmanuel Macron has called the company an example of "French genius" and had Mr. Mensch for dinner at the Élysée presidential palace. Bruno Le Maire, the country's finance minister, frequently praises the company, while Cédric O, the former France digital minister, is an adviser to Mistral and owns shares in the start-up.
The French government's backing is a sign of A.I.'s growing importance. The United States, France, Britain, China, Saudi Arabia and many other countries are trying to strengthen their domestic capabilities, setting off a technological arms race that is influencing trade and foreign policy, as well as global supply chains.
Mistral has emerged as the strongest European contender in the global battle. Yet many question whether the company can keep up with large American and Chinese competitors and develop a sustainable business model. In addition to the considerable technological challenges of building a successful A.I. company, the computing power needed is staggeringly expensive. (France says its cheap nuclear power can meet the energy demand.)
OpenAI has raised $ 13 billion, and Anthropic, another San Francisco firm, has raised more than $ 7.3 billion. Mistral has so far raised roughly 500 million euros, or $ 540 million, and earns "several million" in recurring revenue, Mr. Mensch said. But in a sign of Mistral's promise, Microsoft took a small stake in February, and Salesforce and the chipmaker Nvidia have backed the start-up.
"This could be one of the best shots that we have in Europe," said Jeannette zu Fürstenberg, the managing director of General Catalyst and a founding partner of La Famiglia, two venture capital firms that invested in Mistral. "You basically have a very potent technology that will unlock value."
Mistral subscribes to the view that A.I. software should be open source, meaning that the programming codes should be available for anyone to copy, tweak or repurpose. Supporters say allowing other researchers to see the code will make systems safer and fuel economic growth by speeding its use among businesses and governments for applications like accounting, customer service and database searches. This week, Mistral released the latest version of its model online for anyone to download.
OpenAI and Anthropic, by contrast, are keeping their platforms closed. Open source is dangerous, they argue, because it has the potential to be co-opted by for bad purposes, like spreading disinformation -- or even creating destructive A.I.-powered weapons.
Mr. Mensch dismissed such concerns as the narrative of "a fear-mongering lobby" that includes Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which he said were seeking to cement their dominance by persuading policymakers to enact rules that would squash rivals.
A.I.'s biggest risk, Mr. Mensch added, is that it will spur a workplace revolution, eliminating some jobs while creating new ones that will require retraining. "It's coming faster than in the previous revolutions," he said, "not in 10 years but more like in two."
Mr. Mensch, who grew up in a family of scientists, said he was fascinated by computers from a young age, learning to program when he was 11. He played video games avidly until age 15, when he decided he could "do better things with my time." After graduating from two elite French universities, École Polytechnique and École Normale Supérieure, he became an academic researcher in 2020 at France's prestigious National Center for Scientific Research. But he soon pivoted to DeepMind, an A.I. lab acquired by Google, to learn about the industry and become an entrepreneur.
When ChatGPT burst onto the scene in 2022, Mr. Mensch teamed up with his university friends, who decided that they could do the same or better in France. At the company's airy work space, a corps of sneaker-wearing scientists and programmers now tap busily at keyboards, coding and feeding digital text culled from the internet -- as well as reams of 19th-century French literature, which is no longer subject to copyright law -- into the company's large language model.
Mr. Mensch said he felt uncomfortable with Silicon Valley's "very religious" fascination with the concept of artificial general intelligence, the point when, tech leaders like Elon Musk and Sam Altman believe, computers will overtake the cognitive ability of humans, with potentially dire consequences.
"The whole A.G.I. rhetoric is about creating God," he said. "I don't believe in God. I'm a strong atheist. So I don't believe in A.G.I."
A more imminent threat, he said, is the one posed by American A.I. giants to cultures around the globe.
"These models are producing content and shaping our cultural understanding of the world," Mr. Mensch said. "And as it turns out, the values of France and the values of the United States differ in subtle but important ways."
With his growing clout, Mr. Mensch has stepped up his calls for lighter regulation, warning that restrictions will damage innovation. Last fall, France successfully lobbied in Brussels to limit regulation of open-source A.I. systems in the European Union's new Artificial Intelligence Act, a victory that helps Mistral maintain a rapid development pace.
"If Mistral becomes a big technical power," said Mr. O, the former digital minister who led the lobbying effort, "it's going to be beneficial for all of Europe."

A Novel A.I. Innovation, but It Is Not Yet Very Useful: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: On a recent afternoon, I held a bagel in front of me and said: "Look and tell me if this is healthy."
A monotone voice responded that the bagel was unhealthy because it was high in carbohydrates, which could contribute to weight gain.
I wasn't talking to a tech bro obsessed with the ketogenic diet. This was the Ai Pin, a $ 700 tiny computer featuring a virtual assistant pulling data from OpenAI (the research firm behind the ChatGPT chatbot), Google, Microsoft and others to answer questions and perform tasks.
Shaped like a lapel pin that may be a throwback to "Star Trek," it attaches to your clothing with magnets and is supposed to offload tasks you would normally do with a smartphone, like taking notes, searching the web and shooting photos. Instead of a screen, the pin shines a green laser on your hand to show text. The device includes a camera, speaker and cellular connection.
The novel design of the Ai Pin, which was made by the start-up Humane, generated buzz when it was unveiled late last year. Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, and companies including Microsoft and Salesforce have placed a bold bet -- to the tune of $ 240 million in funding for Humane -- that artificially intelligent hardware like the Ai Pin will become the next big thing after the smartphone. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft last year for using copyrighted news articles without permission to train chatbots.)
Humane said its goal with the Ai Pin was to offer technology that would help people avoid screens and maintain eye contact.
I liked the chic aesthetic and concept of the pin. It was occasionally helpful, like when it suggested items to pack for my recent trip to Hawaii. But as I wore it for two weeks, it presented glaring flaws. Often, its responses were off-putting, like with the bagel, or wrong, like when it said the square root of 49 was 49. Also, The Times's photo shoot of the Ai Pin ended prematurely when the device overheated and shut down.
I wouldn't pay $ 700 for this pin -- let alone the $ 24-a-month subscription required to use its data services, including its T-Mobile cellular plan. But consider my curiosity piqued.
Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, Humane's husband-and-wife founders, who worked at Apple, said updates issued through its servers would address many of the glitches I had encountered, including heat issues and shoddy math.
"It's a journey, and we are just at the start," Ms. Bongiorno said. "The first version is never the entirety of the vision."
Here's how my experience wearing the Ai Pin went.
Getting Started
Since the Ai Pin lacks a screen, users set up their accounts and other settings on Humane's website. To unlock the device with a passcode, hold out your hand to project a green laser onto your palm. Pulling your hand outward increases the number while pulling it inward decreases it, and you select each digit by pinching two fingers on the same hand.
The laser can be used to tweak other settings, like connecting to a Wi-Fi network, and it can show a text transcription of the virtual assistant's answers. Humane said the laser was intended to be used for no longer than nine minutes, but for me, it lasted about three before the Ai Pin complained it was too hot and shut down.
A Virtual Assistant
Beyond unlocking the pin with the laser, you'll control the Ai Pin mostly with finger taps and your voice. The advantage of pinning a virtual assistant to my shirt became clear when I was moving around and thinking about the many things I had to do.
With one finger held down on the Ai Pin, I could summon the assistant and ask it to add tasks to my to-do list. This feature shined when I was packing for my vacation to Hawaii and adding items to my packing list, including T-shirts and swim trunks. When I asked the pin to suggest other items to pack for my trip there, it recommended a hat, sunscreen and other relevant items. Very cool.
However, the Ai Pin was less helpful in some other situations. When I was in Hawaii last week, I struggled to remember the name of a food truck near my hotel serving loco moco, so I asked the assistant to look it up for me. It said no such food truck could be found, leading me to search on my phone instead.
A Language Interpreter
An important feature on the Ai Pin is the ability to translate a conversation into another language in real time. With one finger held down on the pin, I could set a language to translate to, such as Mandarin. When I held two fingers down on the pin and spoke a phrase in English, the Ai Pin said it in Mandarin, and vice versa.
I tested this with several other languages, including Spanish, French and Indonesian. I confirmed that the interpreter was usually correct, though with converting English into Mandarin, it incorrectly translated "good morning" into "da jia hao," which means "hello, everyone."
Would You Look at That?
Humane is including a feature called Vision on the Ai Pin, which is labeled "beta" to signal that it is unfinished. The device uses its camera and A.I. to analyze your surroundings and give information about what you are looking at. This is what led to my quirky experience with a bagel, which only got weirder when I asked more questions.
I asked the pin how to make the bagel more delicious, and it proceeded to explain how to make bagels from scratch. Eventually, I asked the pin to come up with suggestions for sandwiches that could be made with the bagel. It generated a long list of ideas, including chickpea salad sandwiches, sloppy Joes and cucumber sandwiches with green chutney.
On vacation, I visited a botanical garden and asked the pin to identify a flower. "The flower is yellow with red stripes on the inside," the pin said. This was correct, but it didn't answer my question.
"It's a Solandra maxima," my wife said. She had taken a photo of the flower with her phone and uploaded it into a Google Images search. I felt sheepish.
Humane said it was working constantly to improve the Vision feature.
The Phone Stuff
Similar to a smartphone, the Ai Pin has its own phone number and cellular data connection to place phone calls and play music, and its camera can be used to shoot photos and videos.
Here is where the Ai Pin especially underdelivered. For something designed to make you spend less time on your phone, it isn't better than a smartphone at any of those tasks. Photos and videos taken with the camera look poorly lit and blurry. To place a phone call, you can ask the assistant to call someone in your address book, but to dial a new number, you dictate the digits. For music, the device currently works only with Tidal, an unpopular music streaming service.
Ms. Bongiorno said the Ai Pin let her take more candid photos without a screen getting in the way. But to me, this was a disadvantage. Without a viewfinder, photos looked poorly framed.
Bottom Line
While the Ai Pin was occasionally useful and impressive, it was wrong, unhelpful or inefficient enough times to drive me back to my phone.
Gary Marcus, an A.I. entrepreneur, said the mistakes the Ai Pin made, like with the bagel, were the result of so-called hallucinations, the tendency for A.I. to guess and make things up when it can't find the right answer. That's a problem that remains unsolved in many A.I. technologies including ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.
Ms. Bongiorno acknowledged that hallucinations were happening with Gemini, the technology behind the Ai Pin's Vision feature. She added that the technology would improve rapidly with user feedback and that the company had already finessed the pin's reaction to bagels.
Mr. Marcus said no company yet had A.I. technology that was sophisticated enough to make a virtual assistant answer questions reliably.
"It's almost like a broken watch being right twice a day," he said. "It's right some of the time, but you don't know which part of the time, and that greatly diminishes its value."
Yet there is a kernel of an idea worth preserving. I liked having an assistant on my shirt when it was actually helpful. I'll pin my hopes on future iterations of the product -- perhaps a cheaper one that lacks a camera and a laser.

Microsoft Unbundles Teams Ahead of Regulators: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech giant is unbundling Teams from its Office software suite, as it faces mounting scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic.
Microsoft unbundles, again
Microsoft is separating Teams, its popular video and chat app, from its Office software suite in markets around the world, broadening a split that began in the European Union last fall.
It appears to be the latest effort by the software giant to head off investigations by global antitrust enforcers as regulators examine the power of Big Tech.
Rivals have complained about the Teams-Office bundle for years. Microsoft first added the video and document collaboration program to its business software suite in 2017, and saw Teams's popularity soar after the coronavirus pandemic unleashed a boom in hybrid and remote working.
At the height of the lockdown in 2020, Slack filed a complaint with the European Commission accusing Microsoft of anticompetitive behavior by bundling Teams with Office. (Three months later, Slack agreed to sell itself to Salesforce for $ 27.7 billion.) And last summer, Eric Yuan, the C.E.O. of Zoom, called on the F.T.C. to follow the E.U. in investigating the Teams-Office tie-up.
It's unclear if Microsoft's decision will help it avoid an E.U. fine, which could cost the company up to 10 percent of global revenue. The company told Reuters that the move "addresses feedback from the European Commission by providing multinational companies more flexibility when they want to standardize their purchasing across geographies."
It comes as tech behemoths are facing investigations by regulators worldwide. Last month, the Justice Department sued Apple over its tight control of the iOS operating system, while Google is awaiting a judge's verdict in a U.S. lawsuit over its search monopoly.
And Microsoft has drawn scrutiny over its investments in A.I. start-ups like OpenAI and the French company Mistral.
The move is reminiscent of Microsoft's unbundling of Windows in the 2000s, after a bruising antitrust battle with the Justice Department over the tech company's efforts to shut rivals out of its platform.
But it's unclear how consequential this breakup will be. Shares in Microsoft rose on Monday despite the news, as analysts questioned whether the move would mean much for the tech giant's bottom line. Data from the research firm Sensor Tower showed that use of Teams stayed relatively stable even after the program was cleaved out of Office in the E.U.
That suggests rivals may not experience a surge in new customers. (Shares in Zoom fell nearly 1 percent on Monday.) "Teams is so embedded into workflows that I don't think this has that same impact," Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters.
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Donald Trump posts a $ 175 million bond to avert seizure of his assets. In securing the bond for his civil fraud case, the former president avoided paying a $ 454 million penalty while he appeals the judgment. Separately, shares in Trump Media & Technology Group plunged 21 percent on Monday, after the parent company of the Truth Social online platform disclosed just $ 4 million in revenue for last year.
Disney is said to be winning its proxy fight against the financier Nelson Peltz. The entertainment giant's slate of board nominees has secured the backing of big shareholders, including BlackRock and T. Rowe Price, ahead of the company's annual meeting on Wednesday. More than half of Disney's voting shares have been accounted for, but a big question is how the company's unusually high percentage of individual shareholders will vote.
A regulator is reportedly scrutinizing investments by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street in U.S. banks. The F.D.I.C. is examining whether the big money managers are maintaining a sufficiently passive role in managing their stakes, according to The Wall Street Journal. Such firms are exempt from current rules that require regulatory approval to own more than 10 percent of a bank -- if they don't exert influence on management or boards.
A $ 4.1 billion bet on sports
One of the biggest players in the booming business of sports just got bigger: The private equity firm Arctos Partners has raised another $ 4.1 billion to do more deals.
The fund-raising shows investor appetite for sports deals is growing as competition ramps up between private equity firms and Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
Arctos is one of the busiest sports deal makers. Since its founding in 2019, the firm has invested in Formula One, basketball, baseball and soccer clubs. They include the Utah Jazz and Fenway Sports Group.
Sports deals are booming on the back of the skyrocketing value for media rights. John Malone's Liberty Media, which owns F1, said on Monday that it had bought MotoGP, the motorcycle racing championship, for €4.2 billion ( $ 4.5 billion).
The deal follows a record year for sports M.& A., with transaction values up 27 percent to roughly $ 25 billion in 2023, according to Bloomberg calculations. That included big investments by Arctos in the Qatar-owned French soccer club Paris Saint-Germain and the Aston Martin F1 team.
Sovereign investors are the big new players. Saudi Arabia is pouring billions into soccer and golf, and may be looking at tennis next. And Qatar last year bought a stake in the owner of Washington's professional basketball and hockey teams.
Arctos sees itself as part of a new wave of long-term deal makers that treat teams like an asset class. As sports leagues have loosened their rules to allow for institutional investors, firms like Blue Owl and Dynasty Equity say they are committed to long-term investments that aren't tied to economic volatility.
"We're not a control buyer. And we're not a leveraged buyout fund," Ian Charles, an Arctos co-founder, told DealBook.
Arctos played down the rising competition. Charles told DealBook that sports leagues put heavy restrictions on allowing state-backed investment, if they allow them at all. He declined to say whether Arctos had raised money from sovereign wealth funds, though the company said in a statement that its latest fund-raising round included pension funds and "global wealth platforms."
The latest report card for Bridgewater's post-Dalio era
Ray Dalio gave up day-to-day management of Bridgewater Associates 18 months ago. Since then, Nir Bar Dea, his successor atop the giant hedge fund, has been under pressure to show that one of the world's most successful investment firms can maintain its dominance.
Results from the first three months of 2024 suggest that Bridgewater is performing well. But can changes to how the firm is run keep it in the top tier of industry performers?
Its flagship Pure Alpha fund is up 15.9 percent year to date, according to a notice sent to investors on Monday that DealBook has reviewed. That's up more than sevenfold over the Bloomberg Macro Hedge Fund Index, which tracks funds with a similar strategy.
Pure Alpha is now up 38.4 percent, net of fees, since the creation of Bridgewater's investment committee in August 2020.
The hard part is maintaining that performance. For much of 2022 and 2023, Pure Alpha has performed well -- only to tumble precipitously at the end of each of those years. Bridgewater as a whole lost $ 2.6 billion last year, one of just two top-tier firms to lose money, according to the research firm LCH Investments.
That continued a string of poor performance in the 2010s that tarnished Bridgewater's reputation as a profit machine. (It also raised questions about Dalio's famously idiosyncratic and brutally blunt management style, including baseball cards that featured ratings of each worker based on colleagues' assessments of them.)
Bar Dea has sought to make Bridgewater more flexible in how it arrives at investment decisions, Bloomberg reports. That includes increasing the number of people who review those moves and pledges to embrace artificial intelligence.
Will that be enough to keep clients happy? Some unidentified investors told Bloomberg that they were considering cutting ties if the firm didn't pick up its performance.
That said, Bar Dea is reportedly planning to shrink Pure Alpha and return more money to clients -- a move that could make the fund more nimble.
"The Western world urgently needs a significant increase in productivity growth as the burden of rising government debt and entitlement spending strains almost every major economy."
-- Ken Griffin . The Citadel founder used his annual letter to investors to warn about his growing worries on debt and share his view that the economy will grow only modestly this year as the Fed tries to bring down inflation to its 2 percent target.
Is A.I. actually boosting productivity?
Investor enthusiasm around artificial intelligence has added trillions in market value to a select few tech companies. But its broader economic impact has been harder to measure.
Economists are divided on the A.I. productivity conundrum. On earnings calls, business leaders have been more eager to share with Wall Street how they plan to use the technology in their operations. But whether these tools will achieve widespread productivity gains for the economy is less clear.
"The enthusiasm about large language models and ChatGPT has gone a bit overboard," the Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon told The Times. Others are more hopeful, including Erik Brynjolfsson at Stanford University, who has bet Gordon $ 400 that productivity will take off this decade.
While that wager catches the attention of some in academia, a parade of companies is putting the technology to use:
Walmart has built a generative A.I. chat bot for internal use that answers common H.R. questions including "Do I have dental insurance?"
Abercrombie & Fitch has turned to generative A.I. to brainstorm ideas for clothing designs and to write blurbs for its website and app.
Ben & Jerry's put cameras that use A.I. into the freezers at grocery stores to alert the company and its distributors when a location was running low on a particular ice cream flavor.
Will such use cases impact workers? David Autor, a labor economist at M.I.T. whose work has focused on how technology can erode earning potential, argues it might not be all bad news. The technology could help people with less expertise to do more valuable work, lifting the middle class. Critics are unconvinced.
In other A.I. news: OpenAI introduced a new tool that mimics human voices with high accuracy, showing how the technology is quickly expanding beyond text, but it could also pose a new misinformation threat.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The investor Josh Kushner and his wife, Karlie Kloss, have struck a deal with Barry Diller's media company to revive it as a regular print title.
Kushner and Kloss take over Life magazine
Life, the iconic photography-focused chronicler of the 20th century, has taken on many forms, including a weekly magazine, a website and the occasional special issue.
Now, it is set to resume regular print publication, thanks to a deal between Barry Diller's IAC and Josh Kushner, the venture capitalist whose Thrive Capital is one of the biggest investors in OpenAI, and his wife, the entrepreneur and model Karlie Kloss.
Kushner and Kloss are buying the publication rights to Life from Dotdash Meredith, the print and digital publisher. The deal is being done through Bedford Media, the media start-up that Kloss leads as C.E.O. (The price wasn't disclosed.)
Life was once a central part of American culture, featuring the work of renowned photographers like Robert Capa and writing by top authors. (Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea" first appeared in its pages.)
But its popularity plunged after the 1970s, with the magazine largely being reduced to light reading and celebrity news. In 2008, it became an online archive with occasional newsstand editions.
The backstory: Kushner approached Diller about resurrecting Life about eight months ago, DealBook hears. His pitch was that the magazine could be resurrected in print and online -- as well as in newer iterations like events and collaborations with brands and major studios.
"Life's legacy lies in its ability to blend culture, current events and everyday life -- highlighting the triumphs, challenges and unique perspectives that define us," Kushner said in a statement.
Dotdash Meredith will remain involved: It owns the rights to Life's vast photo and content archive, and will continue to publish special single-topic print editions.
It's the latest high-profile effort to resurrect a legacy publication during a tough time for the media industry. Old-school publishers like Condé Nast and newer ones like Vox and Vice have struggled amid a downturn in advertising.
But Kushner, who will serve as Life's publisher, and Kloss are betting that they have a more focused approach that will succeed. "We see Life as an uplifting and unifying voice in a chaotic media landscape," Kloss said.
The two have already purchased other famous titles. When Bedford was formed last year, it bought the style magazine i-D from Vice. And in 2020, Kloss organized an investor consortium to buy the high-end fashion magazine W.
What's next: Bedford will begin hiring senior editorial staff for Life, which is tentatively set to resume regular publishing early next year.
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Disney ends its legal fight with Ron DeSantis over its Florida special tax district. The entertainment giant and the state's governor agreed to cooperate on new growth plans for the 25,000-acre area that encompasses Walt Disney World. It was a surprising end to a bitter fight that saw DeSantis and his allies take over the district and Disney fight back with quiet efforts to lock in its own development plans.
Amazon invests $ 2.75 billion more into Anthropic. The funding brings the tech giant's total stake in Anthropic, a buzzy artificial intelligence start-up, to $ 4 billion. It's the latest sign of tech giants' eagerness to pour money into promising A.I. technology. Meanwhile, Salesforce reportedly paid more than $ 20 million to license Albert Einstein's image to promote its A.I. efforts.
Deal making roars back in the first quarter. About $ 690.2 billion worth of mergers were announced in the first three months, up 30 percent from the same time last year, according to LSEG. But that growth was driven largely by mega transactions like Capital One's $ 35 billion bid for Discover Financial Services: The number of announced deals was down 31 percent year on year.
How much time will Bankman-Fried serve?
Sam Bankman-Fried is set to be sentenced today, with prosecutors requesting that the FTX founder spend decades in prison and defense lawyers arguing for just a few years.
The 32-year-old's fate will hinge on how Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Southern District of New York weighs how much damage he caused to investors and customers, and how many of them will get their money back.
Prosecutors want Bankman-Fried to serve up to 50 years. The onetime poster child of the crypto industry was found guilty in November of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy after being charged with stealing billions of dollars to fund a lavish lifestyle and his own investments.
In a court filing this month, prosecutors called the fraud "historic," pointing to the magnitude of losses and the tens of thousands of potential victims, including unsophisticated retail investors.
Bankman-Fried's lawyers are calling for leniency. They have asked for a sentence of no more than six and a half years and accused the government of pursuing a "medieval" punishment of an "exceptionally brilliant" young man with much to offer society.
They have also pointed to claims by FTX's lawyers that customers would eventually be repaid. The net harm to customers, lenders and investors, they said, is "zero."
FTX's current leader blasted those claims. John Ray told Judge Kaplan this month that recovering the money wasn't guaranteed and would take work by his team. It was "categorically, callously, and demonstrably false" to say that no harm was caused, he added.
Victim restitution won't guarantee a lighter sentence. "It's a crime to defraud people," Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, told DealBook. "And the sheer scale of the fraud here was large." He expects a sentence of 20 to 30 years.
Mark Kornfeld of the law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney agreed that Bankman-Fried's role in victims regaining their money may not matter much. "He's not the one making them whole," he told The Financial Times.
A cheat sheet for tomorrow's inflation report
As the S&P 500 heads into the last trading day of the quarter, the index is closing in on a fifth straight monthly gain. Driving that are hopes that the Fed will start cutting interest rates as early as June.
But new inflation data could still derail that momentum. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which is closely watched in Washington, tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.
Economists expect another hot number. The question is, how hot? Especially strong data could prod the Fed to delay lowering borrowing costs, and affect the number of cuts this year.
Here's what to watch for:
Headline P.C.E. for February is expected to show a 2.5 percent year-on-year gain, a slight increase from the January report.
Core P.C.E., which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, is forecast to come in at 2.8 percent on an annualized basis, roughly in line with the previous month.
Analysts will watch for signs that services inflation -- spending on things like airfare, health care and rent -- has begun to ease. Consumer spending in these areas has remained high in recent months.
Fed hawks are weighing in ahead of the report. Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, said in a speech yesterday that the central bank should hold off on cutting rates until he sees "at least a couple months of better inflation data." (The title of his talk: "There's Still No Rush.")
Investors sold off Treasury notes after Waller's comments. But the futures market this morning is still penciling in three rate cuts this year, more or less in line with the Fed's most recent forecast.
"If the leadership doesn't execute a beautiful deleveraging, China will have a Japanese-style lost decade with Marxist characteristics."
-- Ray Dalio , the founder of Bridgewater Associates. In a lengthy post on LinkedIn, the hedge fund billionaire agreed with President Xi Jinping of China about an imminent century of extraordinary change and offered suggestions to help Beijing deal with its economic problems.
The A.I. lobby wants to talk about China
As policymakers try to figure out how to regulate the fast-growing artificial intelligence industry, Silicon Valley has ramped up its lobbying efforts to shape the debate.
Its latest tactic? Tapping into growing worries about China.
The Biden administration is doubling down on China's tech threat. That's evident by recent moves, such as signaling its support for legislation that could see TikTok banned in the U.S.
China is producing more top researchers, though the U.S. has a big lead on investments and breakthroughs.
Silicon Valley is trying to capitalize on the mood. On May 1, tech leaders -- including Palantir's Alex Karp, Sequoia Capital's Roelof Botha and Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures -- are expected to attend a conference in Washington with dozens of lawmakers, like Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana.
Jacob Helberg, an adviser to Palantir and a member of a congressional commission on China's threats to national security, is organizing the event.
For tech companies, Washington's focus on China could be good for business. "The other side of slowing down China is minimal friction and regulation for U.S. companies," Amba Kak, a former senior adviser on A.I. to the F.T.C., told The Times.
The event comes as the industry is ramping up its lobbying efforts. More than 350 organizations reported lobbying the federal government on A.I. issues during the first nine months of 2023, spending a total of $ 569 million on the effort, according to OpenSecrets.
But a Facebook co-founder is reportedly making a different case. Dustin Moskovitz, a major Democratic donor, met with President Biden last month to share his own arguments about A.I. safety, according to Puck.
Moskovitz and others have warned that "mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority." His nonprofit group, Open Philanthropy, has advocated regulations like software export controls and licensing requirements for certain A.I. models.

With Lackluster Growth, Dating Apps Are in Need of a Spark: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As online dating became as easy as swiping a finger across your phone screen, the companies who own apps like Tinder and Bumble became Wall Street darlings. But about a decade later, those platforms are now struggling to live up to expectations, and investors have grown frustrated and eager for something new.
Match Group and Bumble -- which make up nearly the entire industry by market share -- have lost more than $ 40 billion in market value since 2021. Even in an age when the apps are a staple on people's smartphones, the two companies are laying off workers and reporting lackluster revenue growth.
Both companies have recently brought on leaders who have vowed to experiment with new features, hoping to capture the growth investors crave. But they face one critical obstacle: Not enough young people are willing to pay for subscriptions to dating apps -- partly because younger daters are increasingly looking to platforms like Snapchat and TikTok to make connections -- and it's not clear what will change that.
Match Group and Bumble generate the bulk of their revenue -- about $ 4.2 billion for both companies last year -- by selling subscriptions, with smaller income streams from advertising. But they're struggling to grow those sales. Match Group was able to keep revenues steady last year only by raising its prices.
As far as investors are concerned, the businesses need to convince more young users to pay.
"Wall Street loves subscription models because it gives them the comfort of recurring revenues," said Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Securities.
By paying, users can unlock features like unlimited swipes and the ability to see who has swiped on them. But for many people, that's not enough: Unlike other paid subscription services, like Spotify or Netflix, dating apps can't guarantee that you'll find what you're looking for.
"It feels really different to pay for access to people," said Kathryn D. Coduto, a Boston University professor who studies dating apps. "Paying for it makes it feel a little skeezy."
In the United States, 30 percent of adults, and over half of adults under 30, use dating apps, according to a survey by Pew Research Center that was released last year. About a third of dating app users reported paying for them, with men and higher-income adults more likely to pay than others, the survey found.
Millennials, the nation's largest generation, were prime dating age when Tinder first rolled out, but more and more of them have married in recent years, a decision that usually results in people quitting the apps. Now the primary users are from Gen Z, a younger -- and smaller -- demographic with less disposable income. That generational shift poses a challenge for the dating app industry.
Mandy Wang, an 18-year-old student at New York University, said she preferred to meet people in person or through a direct message on platforms like Instagram or Snapchat. Dating apps are for casual use, "like a game," she said.
"People use dating apps, but I don't know anyone who pays for it," Ms. Wang said. In fact, she said that she would consider it an "ick" if she learned somebody was paying for a subscription.
Jess Carbino, a former sociologist for Tinder who is now a consultant and dating coach, said younger people "still feel a desire to use online dating apps, but they're not necessarily experiencing a sense of urgency to find a partner."
"I think what we're seeing is purely a demographic shift," Dr. Carbino said.
Match Group and Bumble declined to comment on their plans to draw in more paying users, pointing to public statements made by their executives.
Bumble's chief executive, Lidiane Jones, told analysts last month that the company would be revamping the app to appeal to more users, particularly younger ones, by adding "personalization and flexibility" to the experience.
Bumble's larger competitor, Match Group, was an early player in the online dating market, starting with Match.com in 1995. The company acquired Tinder in 2017 and Hinge in 2018, kicking off a period of growth that caught investors' attention.
Tinder is the largest brand in Match Group's portfolio and the most popular dating app in the United States. It shook up the industry landscape in 2012 when it introduced a swipe feature, which is now ubiquitous in dating apps. But the swipe's novelty has worn off, and Tinder has lost momentum. The number of paid users on the app was down nearly 10 percent in 2023.
Tinder's struggles, and those of the broader dating app industry, are in part because the format is substantially the same as it has been for more than a decade, said Zach Morrissey, an analyst at Wolfe Research, a financial research firm. But the way people date may have shifted.
"This is a space where product innovation has been relatively muted in recent years," he said.
That's starting to hurt. Bumble, which went public in 2021, initially jumped in value but after a steady slide its stock is now about a quarter of its I.P.O. price. Match Group's stock price reached a high of $ 169 in 2021. It now sits at $ 34, about a fifth of its peak value.
Match Group and Bumble have made some changes recently to convince investors that they can spin things around, but it's unclear what will solve their problems. "There's not an obvious silver bullet that they need to address," Mr. Morrissey said.
Both companies have had some leadership shake-ups: In January, Ms. Jones joined Bumble, and Match Group promoted Faye Iosotaluno, the former chief operating officer of Tinder, to be the app's chief executive.
Bumble announced last month that the company was laying off about a third of its work force in the first half of this year. It also lowered its revenue forecast for the first quarter, below Wall Street expectations.
"The demand for connection and love continues to be really strong -- two billion single people around the globe," Ms. Jones told analysts in February. "Yet the products that are bearing the set of experiences to create those connections are not serving users the way that they want to."
Match Group's chief executive, Bernard Kim, told analysts in a Jan. 31 earnings call that this year Tinder was "adopting a fast-fail mentality, a strategy that prioritizes rapid experimentation and testing." Mr. Kim took over the company in 2022 after previously serving as president of Zynga, the maker of mobile games like Farmville.
He said that the company would attract more paying users through marketing and that it was adjusting its products in various ways, including introducing new à la carte premium features.
Match Group has also expanded its offerings, like a service for L.G.B.T.Q. dating, called Archer, and one marketed toward Latinos, called Chispa. Revenue from those products was down 4 percent in 2023.
Mr. Kim said that Tinder was reimagining the swipe feature altogether and would be rolling out new functions this year. The platform is also pushing for more users to get verified, a move that's aimed at improving safety and helping women feel more comfortable using the app.
The activist investor Elliott Management, which previously led shake-ups at Salesforce and Pinterest, took a $ 1 billion stake in Match Group in January, a sign that Wall Street sees an opportunity for growth.
Elliott declined to comment on its discussions with Match Group. Mr. Kim told analysts that he and the firm had "collaborative dialogue."
Despite the challenges, the dating industry isn't going anywhere, said Ken Gawrelski, an analyst at Wells Fargo.
"Dating, overall, and love, more generally, is a core human behavior," he said. "So it's hard to believe that changes materially. But the way we date, or the way we find matches, is very much an issue in this discussion."

That’s starting to hurt. Bumble, which went public in 2021, initially jumped in value but after a steady slide its stock is now about a quarter of its initial public offering price. Match Group’s stock price reached a high of $169 in 2021. It now sits at $34, about one-fifth of its peak value.
Match Group and Bumble have made some changes recently to convince investors that they can spin things around, but it’s unclear what will solve their problems. “There’s not an obvious silver bullet that they need to address,” Morrissey said.
Both companies have had some leadership shake-ups: In January, Jones joined Bumble, and Match Group promoted Faye Iosotaluno, the former chief operating officer of Tinder, to be the app’s CEO.
Bumble announced last month that the company was laying off about one-third of its workforce in the first half of this year. It also lowered its revenue forecast for the first quarter, below Wall Street expectations.
“The demand for connection and love continues to be really strong — 2 billion single people around the globe,” Jones told analysts in February. “Yet the products that are bearing the set of experiences to create those connections are not serving users the way that they want to.”
Match Group’s CEO, Bernard Kim, told analysts in a Jan. 31 earnings call that this year Tinder was “adopting a fast-fail mentality, a strategy that prioritizes rapid experimentation and testing.” Kim took over the company in 2022 after previously serving as president of Zynga, the maker of mobile games including Farmville.
He said that the company would attract more paying users through marketing and that it was adjusting its products in various ways, including introducing new a la carte premium features.
Match Group has also expanded its offerings, like a service for LGBTQ+ dating, called Archer, and one marketed toward Latinos, called Chispa. Revenue from those products was down 4% in 2023.
Kim said that Tinder was reimagining the swipe feature altogether and would be rolling out new functions this year. The platform is also pushing for more users to get verified, a move that’s aimed at improving safety and helping women feel more comfortable using the app.
Elliott Management, an activist investor that previously led shake-ups at Salesforce and Pinterest, took a $1 billion stake in Match Group in January, a sign that Wall Street sees an opportunity for growth.
Elliott declined to comment on its discussions with Match Group. Kim told analysts that he and the firm had “collaborative dialogue.”
Despite the challenges, the dating industry isn’t going anywhere, said Ken Gawrelski, an analyst at Wells Fargo.
“Dating, overall, and love, more generally, is a core human behavior,” he said. “So it’s hard to believe that changes materially. But the way we date, or the way we find matches, is very much an issue in this discussion.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Altman, whose sudden firing and rehiring in the fall shocked Silicon Valley, was among several new additions to the board announced on Friday.
The conclusion of an investigation into the chaotic firing of Sam Altman from OpenAI more than three months ago represented a resounding victory for the high-profile chief executive as he moves to reassert control of the artificial intelligence company he helped to create.
OpenAI, in a news conference on Friday, said that Mr. Altman, who returned to OpenAI just five days after he was pushed out in November, did not do anything that justified his removal and would regain the one role at the company that still eluded him: a seat on the company's board of directors.
Mr. Altman's ouster stunned Silicon Valley and imperiled the future of one of the tech industry's most influential start-ups. It also called into question whether OpenAI -- with or without Mr. Altman in charge -- was ready to carry the banner for the tech industry's rabid focus on artificial intelligence.
When he returned to OpenAI in November, Mr. Altman did not regain his board seat while agreeing to an investigation of his behavior and the board's actions. Two members who voted for his removal agreed to step down; their replacements, from outside the company, oversaw the investigation by the law firm, WilmerHale. Bret Taylor, chairman of OpenAI's board, said during the news conference that the highly anticipated report about the episode was finished, but the company did not release the report.
The company said that the law firm's report found that OpenAI's board acted within its broad discretion to terminate Mr. Altman, but also found that his conduct did not mandate removal.
"The special committee recommended and the full board expressed their full confidence in Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman," Mr. Taylor said, referring to Greg Brockman, the company president who quit in protest after Mr. Altman was removed. "We are excited and unanimous in our support for Sam and Greg."
OpenAI also moved to address concerns about a lack of diversity on the board by adding three women as directors: Sue Desmond-Hellmann, the former chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Nicole Seligman, the former general counsel of Sony; and Fidji Simo, the chief executive of Instacart.
Mr. Taylor, who was one of the replacements named to OpenAI's board in November, said the board would continue to expand.
With the report and the additions to the board, OpenAI's leadership hoped to move past the controversy of Mr. Altman's ouster. The incident raised myriad questions about his leadership and the San Francisco company's unusual structure -- a nonprofit board that oversees a for-profit company.
But because it has not released the report, OpenAI has left many questions unanswered about the company. Some insiders have asked whether Mr. Altman had too much control over how the investigation was handled.
"As we told the investigators, deception, manipulation, and resistance to thorough oversight should be unacceptable," Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley, the two OpenAI board members who left late last year, said in a statement. "We hope the new board does its job in governing OpenAI and holding it accountable to the mission."
Mr. Taylor appeared alongside Mr. Altman at the news conference on Friday. After announcing the new board members, he said the review found that the previous board acted in good faith in removing Mr. Altman but did not anticipate the challenges that would arise from his dismissal.
"The review determined the board's decision did not arise from concern regarding product safety or security," Mr. Taylor said. "It was simply a breakdown in trust between the board and Mr. Altman."
After Mr. Taylor completed his prepared remarks, Mr. Altman praised the resilience of the company and its partners during and after his removal. "I am pleased this whole thing is over," he said.
OpenAI provided a six-paragraph summary of the report. It said that WilmerHale reviewed 30,000 documents and conducted dozens of interviews, including with OpenAI's previous board members.
It found that the previous board was accurate in its rationale and public explanation for firing Mr. Altman for not being "consistently candid in his communications with the board." It also said that the board didn't anticipate that its action would destabilize the company.
The company said that WilmerHale gave oral briefings on the report, which will not be publicly released, to Mr. Taylor and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary who was also added to the board in November.
Mr. Taylor said OpenAI had made several changes meant to improve the way the company was run, including new governance guidelines for the board, a new conflict of interest policy and a whistle-blower hotline.
OpenAI's summary of the report did not provide insight into the concerns that the company's senior leaders brought to the previous board about Mr. Altman. Before his dismissal, Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist, and Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer, expressed worries about Mr. Altman's management style, including what was characterized as his history of manipulative behavior, The New York Times has reported.
Dr. Sutskever, through a lawyer, has called those claims "false." Ms. Murati said in a company Slack post on Thursday that she shared the same feedback with the board that she had provided directly to Mr. Altman, but said she never reached out to the board to share those concerns.
"I am happy that the independent review has concluded and we can all move forward united," Ms. Murati said on Friday in a post on X, formerly called Twitter.
OpenAI is still being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission over the board's actions and the possibility that Mr. Altman misled investors. Companies that hire outside law firms often turn over the report to public investigators after completion. A spokeswoman for OpenAI's board declined to say whether it would provide the report to the S.E.C.
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
OpenAI, which was valued at more than $ 80 billion in its latest financing round, sits at the forefront of generative A.I., technologies that can generate text, images and sounds. Many believe that generative A.I. could transform the technology industry as thoroughly as the web browser did about three decades ago. Others worry that the technology could cause serious harm, helping to spread online disinformation, replacing countless jobs and maybe even threatening the future of humanity.
After OpenAI released the online chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022, Mr. Altman became the face of the industry's push toward generative A.I. About a year later, the board unexpectedly dismissed him, saying it no longer had confidence in his ability to run the company.
The board had shrunk to six people: three founders and three independent members. Along with the three outsiders, Dr. Sutskever, one of OpenAI's founders, voted to remove Mr. Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board, saying without providing specifics that he had not been "consistently candid in his communications."
Mr. Brockman, another founder, resigned from the company in protest. Days later, Dr. Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Mr. Altman and effectively stepped down from the board, leaving three independent members standing in opposition to Mr. Altman.
OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, before Mr. Altman created a for-profit subsidiary three years later and raised $ 1 billion from Microsoft. The board of the nonprofit, whose stated mission was to build A.I. for the benefit of humanity, maintained complete control over the new subsidiary. Investors, including Microsoft, had no legal say in who ran the company.
In an effort to resolve the turmoil and return Mr. Altman to the company, he and the board agreed to replace two members with Mr. Taylor, who is a former Salesforce executive. But Mr. Altman was not reinstated to the board. Mr. Taylor and Mr. Summers were charged with overseeing the investigation into Mr. Altman and his dismissal.
Microsoft, a close partner of OpenAI, has a board observer position, which is filled by Dee Templeton, the company's vice president, technology and research partnerships. Microsoft declined on Friday to comment on the board and report.
The new board faced criticism from corporate governance experts because of its lack of diversity. Mr. Taylor told The Times in November that he would fill out the board by adding "qualified, diverse candidates" who embodied "the fullness of what this mission represents, which is going to span technology, A.I. safety policy."

New Details On Removal Of Altman: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer, brought questions about Mr. Altman's management to the board last year before he was briefly ousted from the company, people familiar with the matter said.
More than three months after OpenAI's board of directors briefly ousted Sam Altman, the chief executive of the high-profile artificial intelligence company, questions remain about exactly what led the board to make such a dramatic move.
A report from an outside law firm, which is expected in the coming days, could shed more light on the board's decision as well as the chaotic five days before Mr. Altman returned to the company.
But as anticipation for the report grows, previously unreported details are emerging about the role that Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer, played in the ouster of Mr. Altman.
Ms. Murati wrote a private memo to Mr. Altman raising questions about his management and also shared her concerns with the board. That move helped to propel the board's decision to force him out, according to people with knowledge of the board's discussions who asked for anonymity because of the sensitive nature of a personnel issue.
Around the same time, Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI, expressed similar worries, citing what he characterized as Mr. Altman's history of manipulative behavior, the people said. Both executives described a hot-and-cold relationship with Mr. Altman. Though it was not clear whether they offered specific examples, the executives said he sometimes created a toxic work environment by freezing out executives who did not support his decisions, the people said.
Ms. Murati's interactions with the board offer insight into problems festering at the senior levels of OpenAI, though both executives publicly backed Mr. Altman's return to the company.
WilmerHale, the law firm conducting the investigation, is expected to wrap up the process imminently. The company is expected to announce a new board of directors at the same time, some of the people said. Several directors left the board after Mr. Altman returned to the company in November.
Hannah Wong, a spokeswoman for OpenAI, said in a statement that the company's senior leadership team, led by Ms. Murati during her time as interim chief executive, unanimously asked for Mr. Altman's return, as did an open letter signed by 95 percent of OpenAI's employees.
"The strong support from his team underscores that he is an effective C.E.O. who is open to different points of view, willing to solve complex challenges, and who demonstrates care for his team," Ms. Wong said. "We look forward to findings from the independent review versus unsubstantiated claims."
Mr. Altman declined to comment. Mr. Sutskever's lawyer, Alex Weingarten, said claims that he had approached the board were "categorically false."
Ms. Murati did not respond to a request for comment. But in a message to OpenAI employees after publication of this article, she said she and Mr. Altman "have a strong and productive partnership and I have not been shy about sharing feedback with him directly."
She added that she did not reach out to the board but "when individual board members reached out directly to me for feedback about Sam, I provided it -- all feedback Sam already knew," and that did not mean she was "responsible for or supported the old board's actions."
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
Since November, OpenAI and its investors have scrambled to contain the fallout from the incident, which threatened to upend one of the tech industry's most important start-ups. OpenAI was valued at more than $ 80 billion in its last financing round.
Much of the remaining 700-plus employees at OpenAI -- many of whom threatened to quit when Mr. Altman was fired -- hope to put the events in November behind them. (Some employees refer to that period as "The Blip.")
But there are others who are hopeful that the WilmerHale investigation will provide a thorough accounting of the events surrounding Mr. Altman's dismissal. It is not clear if the full report or a synopsis of it will be released to the public.
At the time of Mr. Altman's firing, OpenAI's six-person board included Dr. Sutskever; Helen Toner, an A.I. researcher who works at a Georgetown University think tank; Adam D'Angelo, a former Facebook executive; Greg Brockman, a co-founder and president of the company; Tasha McCauley, an adjunct senior management scientist at the RAND Corporation; and Mr. Altman.
As a condition of Mr. Altman's reinstatement, executives agreed to shuffle OpenAI's board to include a more diverse and independent set of directors. OpenAI's six-person board was whittled down to an interim board of three: Bret Taylor, a former Salesforce and Facebook executive, joined as a board chairman helping to appoint a new set of directors. Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, also joined. Mr. D'Angelo remains on the board.
In October, Ms. Murati approached some members of the board and expressed concerns about Mr. Altman's leadership, the people said.
She described what some considered to be Mr. Altman's playbook, which included manipulating executives to get what he wanted. First, Ms. Murati said Mr. Altman would tell people what they wanted to hear to charm them and support his decisions. If they did not go along with his plans or if it took too long for them to make a decision, he would then try to undermine the credibility of people who challenged him, the people said.
Ms. Murati told the board she had previously sent a private memo to Mr. Altman outlining some of her concerns with his behavior and shared some details of the memo with the board, the people said.
Around the same time in October, Dr. Sutskever approached members of the board and expressed similar issues about Mr. Altman, the people said.
Some members of the board were concerned that Ms. Murati and Dr. Sutskever would leave the company if Mr. Altman's behavior was not addressed. They also grew concerned the company would see an exodus of talent if top lieutenants left.
There were other factors that went into the decision. Some members were concerned about the creation of the OpenAI Startup Fund, a venture fund started by Mr. Altman. Unlike a typical company investment fund, which is a legal extension of the corporation, Mr. Altman held legal ownership for the OpenAI fund and raised money from outside limited partners. OpenAI said that the structure was temporary, and that Mr. Altman would not receive financial benefit from it.
The OpenAI fund used that money to invest in other artificial intelligence start-ups. Some members of the board grew concerned that Mr. Altman used the fund to skirt accountability from OpenAI's nonprofit governance structure. They confronted Mr. Altman about his legal ownership and operational control over the fund last year.
Axios has previously reported on Mr. Altman's control of the OpenAI fund.
Members of the board began discussing their next steps after they were approached by Ms. Murati and Dr. Sutskever. By mid-November, the board planned to name Ms. Murati as interim chief executive while conducting a search for a new C.E.O., the people said. The board ousted Mr. Altman on Nov. 17.
In the days after, Mr. Altman waged a public fight to regain his position, using a mix of public pressure and powerful allies in Silicon Valley to push for his reinstatement. Most of OpenAI's 770 employees threatened to quit if he were not reinstalled as chief executive. Ms. Murati and Dr. Sutskever quickly -- and publicly -- said they supported Mr. Altman's return to the company. Dr. Sutskever has not returned to his regular duties at the company, some of the people said.
After five days of public back and forth, Mr. Altman returned to his job.

S.E.C. Is Reviewing Board Over Altman's Brief Firing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The U.S. regulator opened its inquiry after the board unexpectedly fired the company's chief executive, Sam Altman, in November.
The Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry into OpenAI soon after the company's board of directors unexpectedly removed Sam Altman, its chief executive, at the end of last year, three people familiar with the inquiry said.
The regulator has sent official requests to OpenAI, the developer of the ChatGPT online chatbot, seeking information about the situation. It is unclear whether the S.E.C. is investigating Mr. Altman's behavior, the board's decision to oust him or both.
Even as OpenAI has tried to turn the page on the dismissal of Mr. Altman, who was soon reinstated, the controversy continues to hound the company. In addition to the S.E.C. inquiry, the San Francisco artificial intelligence company has hired a law firm to conduct its own investigation into Mr. Altman's behavior and the board's decision to remove him.
The board dismissed Mr. Altman on Nov. 17, saying it no longer had confidence in his ability to run OpenAI. It said he had not been "consistently candid in his communications," though it did not provide specifics. It agreed to reinstate him five days later.
Privately, the board worried that Mr. Altman was not sharing all of his plans to raise money from investors in the Middle East for an A.I. chip project, people with knowledge of the situation have said.
Spokespeople for the S.E.C. and OpenAI and a lawyer for Mr. Altman all declined to comment.
The S.E.C.'s inquiry was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
OpenAI kicked off an industrywide A.I. boom at the end of 2022 when it released ChatGPT. The company is considered a leader in what is called generative A.I., technologies that can generate text, sounds and images from short prompts. A recent funding deal values the start-up at more than $ 80 billion.
Many believe that generative A.I., which represents a fundamental shift in the way computers behave, could remake the industry as thoroughly as the iPhone or the web browser. Others argue that the technology could cause serious harm, helping to spread online disinformation, replacing jobs with unusual speed and maybe even threatening the future of humanity.
After the release of ChatGPT, Mr. Altman became the face of the industry's push toward generative A.I. as he endlessly promoted the technology -- while acknowledging the dangers.
In an effort to resolve the turmoil surrounding Mr. Altman's ouster, he and the board agreed to remove two members and add two others: Bret Taylor, who is a former Salesforce executive, and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers.
Mr. Altman and the board also agreed that OpenAI would start its own investigation into the matter. That investigation, by the WilmerHale law firm, is expected to close soon.

Tech Companies Propel Indexes to More Record Highs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street closed out its fourth winning month in a row with more record highs.
The S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent Thursday, beating the high it set last week. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9 percent, besting its record set in 2021. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 0.1 percent, finishing just below the record it set last week.
Yields eased in the bond market after a closely followed inflation report showed that prices across the country rose pretty much as expected last month. Earlier reports had shown prices rose more than expected in January at the consumer and wholesale levels.
"While inflation was hotter than it's been in a while, it may be more of a flash in the pan than the start of something worse," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
Wednesday's report kept intact hopes that the Federal Reserve may begin cutting interest rates in June. Such a move would relax the pressure on the economy and boost investment prices, and the Fed has already indicated several cuts may be coming this year.
The Fed's main interest rate is sitting at its highest level since 2001 in hopes of grinding down inflation.
Relief on rates, though, would come only if the Fed sees more convincing data that inflation is sustainably heading down toward its target of 2 percent.
More recently, traders have been pushing back forecasts for when the Fed may begin cutting rates. A series of reports showing the economy remains stronger than expected have pushed expectations out from March. On Thursday, another report showed fewer workers filed for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected. It was the latest signal of a remarkably resilient job market.
Tech companies like Nvidia, which rose 1.9 percent, helped lead the market's gains.
Salesforce.com became one of the latest companies to report better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected on Wednesday evening. The customer-resource management software company also said it planned to begin paying a quarterly dividend to its investors, but it gave a forecast for revenue this upcoming year that was a bit below analysts' expectations. Its stock climbed 3 percent after flipping an earlier loss.
C3.ai jumped 24.5 percent after the software company reported a smaller loss than analysts expected and stronger revenue.
Best Buy gained 1.3 percent after it reported better profit and revenue than expected. The retailer also said it was increasing its dividend and that its paid membership base is growing.
Hormel Foods likewise reported stronger profit and revenue than expected. It cited broad-based growth across its brands, including Skippy peanut better, Chi-Chi's salsa and Corn Nuts snacks. Its stock leaped 14.6 percent.
They helped offset a 5.4 percent drop for Bath & Body Works. The seller of fragrances, body lotion and three-wick candles reported better profit than expected, helped by a strong holiday season, but it said sales may weaken this year.
Even though it nearly doubled analysts' fourth-quarter profit projections, the cloud-computing company Snowflake tumbled 18.1 percent after a surprise announcement that Frank Slootman, the chief executive, was retiring effective immediately. Mr. Slootman will be replaced by Sridhar Ramaswamy.
Chemours tumbled 31.5 percent after it put three top executives, including its C.E.O., on administrative leave while the audit committee of its board conducts a review. The company said it needed more time to complete its year-end reporting process, and it delayed the release of its quarterly results, which was earlier planned for Wednesday.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.24 percent from 4.27 percent late Wednesday.

Wall Street Drifts Lower in Final Stretch of a Winning Month: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-street-drifts-lower-final-stretch-winning/docview/2931868932/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks edged back from record levels Monday as they head for the final stretch of what looks to be their latest winning month.
The S&P 500 slipped 19.27 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,069.53 after closing last week at a high. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 62.30, or 0.2 percent, to 39,069.23, and the Nasdaq composite dipped 20.57, or 0.1 percent, to 15,976.25.
Berkshire Hathaway was one of the heaviest weights on the market, even though Warren Buffett's company reported stronger results for the end of 2023 than analysts expected. Class-B shares of the company, whose subsidiaries include GEICO, Fruit of the Loom and Brooks running shoes, initially jumped more than 3 percent but later fell back to a loss of 1.9 percent.
The famed investor warned shareholders not to expect any more "eye-popping performance" because there are no bargains available in the market of big enough size to make a meaningful difference. Mr. Buffett is notorious for buying companies when they're cheap.
That follows broader criticism from some financial analysts that prices all over Wall Street have soared too high in its big run since Halloween.
The S&P 500 is on track to close out its fourth straight winning month and is coming off its 15th winning week in the last 17. And the stock market may not have been cheap even when it bottomed out in October 2022. That marked the priciest bear-market low in history, according to some measures of stock prices against corporate earnings, says Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of Leuthold.
This recent rally got going last October amid hopes that inflation is cooling enough for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates several times this year. Such cuts would relax the pressure on the economy and financial system, while goosing investment prices.
Expectations are still high for rate cuts to come eventually this year, but traders have been delaying their forecasts following some stronger-than-expected reports on the economy. That data in the meantime raises hopes that growth in profits for companies can strengthen, which helps stock prices too.
Amazon's stock slipped 0.1 percent in its first day as a member of the Dow Jones industrial average. It replaced Walgreens Boots Alliance, which fell 3.4 percent.
Homebuilder stocks were mixed after a report showed sales of new homes strengthened last month by less than economists expected. Toll Brothers gained 1.1 percent, and Lennar fell 0.6 percent.
Intuitive Machines lost more than a third of its value after the company said its lunar lander may stop working Tuesday after it landed sideways near the south pole of the moon. The 34.6 percent drop, though, only trims what's been a moonshot for its stock so far this year. It's still up 145.4 percent since the end of 2023.
Last week, stocks got a big boost after another blowout report from Nvidia added more chum to the frenzy that's already built around artificial-intelligence technology. Nvidia, whose chips help power AI technologies, rose another 0.3 percent Monday, and it's already up nearly 60 percent so far this year.
Earnings reporting season for the big companies in the S&P 500 is in its tail end, but this week still offers updates from several big names. They include several that could give color on how well spending by U.S. households is holding up. Such spending has been one of the main reasons the U.S. economy has blasted through expectations for a possible recession.
Best Buy, Lowe's and TJX, the parent company of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, will all report this week. So will several big tech-related companies, including Salesforce.com and HP.
Treasury yields ticked higher in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28 percent from 4.25 percent late Friday.

Saudis Project Normalcy With Investment Conference: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dozens of U.S. financiers and investors attended the Future Investment Initiative to deepen their business ties with the kingdom.
Toeing the line in Miami Beach
America's corporate elite were everywhere in Miami at the Future Investment Initiative conference, Saudi Arabia's latest bid to showcase its extensive wealth and deepen ties with Western business.
The event last week showed how far the Saudis have shifted the narrative after murdering the journalist Jamal Khashoggi -- and how willing executives are to kiss the ring of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's de facto ruler, in return for cash. DealBook's Lauren Hirsch was on hand to report on the financiers and Hollywood A-listers who made the trip.
Everyone wanted everything to look normal. The Saudis are using their vast oil wealth to become one the world's biggest investors and forge closer relationships with Wall Street, Silicon Valley and more.
Lots of big names showed up: Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Barry Sternlicht of Starwood, Alex Karp of Palantir and Hollywood royalty like Brian Grazer and Gwyneth Paltrow. (So too did former Trump officials including Steven Mnuchin, the former Treasury secretary; Mike Pompeo, a previous secretary of state; and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law.) Attendees mingled over wine, which is banned in Saudi Arabia, and Carbone's spicy rigatoni.
But everything isn't entirely normal. One guest who works with a Saudi family office told DealBook he couldn't invest in an artificial intelligence company because its owners were wary of being connected to the kingdom. Another said that the real test of Saudi's makeover is the level of her family's concern when she visits the country.
Saudi demands that its partners set foot in the kingdom in return for cash. Some guests whispered that the Saudis expect private equity firms to set up offices there and make sure their C.E.O. makes at least one annual visit as part of any deal.
And there's another unwritten rule: Saudi's rivalry with the United Arab Emirates means that U.S. businesses can't open offices in both countries on the same day.
Panelists praised Prince Mohammed and avoided controversy. Tough questions were rare and speakers were often interviewed by their colleagues or employees. "As the kingdom brings forward gender equality, what are the things you think we can teach the kingdom about what we've learned about parity and how that's working out for us?" Moj Mahdara, the managing partner of Paltrow's Kinship Ventures, asked the actress and investor.
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Inflation and earnings top this week's agenda. Wall Street will scrutinize Thursday's release of Personal Consumption Expenditures data, a report closely watched by the Fed. On the corporate earnings front, Lowe's and Macy's report on Tuesday; Salesforce and Paramount Global on Wednesday and AB InBev on Thursday. Also, artificial intelligence and C.E.O. compensation will be on the agenda at Apple's annual meeting on Wednesday.
Ant Group is said to have bid the most for Credit Suisse's China joint venture. The Alibaba-affiliated financial giant has made a higher offer than Citadel Securities for the investment banking business, according to Bloomberg. That creates a dilemma for UBS, which acquired Credit Suisse last year: Citadel's bid is more likely to win government approval, but the local partner in the joint venture will probably favor Ant's offer.
Israel plans to increase borrowing and raise taxes to fund its war against Hamas. The country intends to sell $ 60 billion worth of debt, increase its value-added tax and freeze government hiring this year, an official told The Financial Times. The move comes after Moody's downgraded Israel's credit rating this month.
What next for Haley's deep-pocketed donors?
After getting drubbed by Donald Trump in her home state of South Carolina, Nikki Haley insisted that she would continue her campaign for the Republican presidential nomination through Super Tuesday next week.
But she will have to do so without the support of her most prominent backer, the Koch-affiliated Americans for Prosperity Action, a super PAC -- raising questions about whether other G.O.P. donors who had stuck by her were rethinking their support.
"We don't believe any outside group can make a material difference to widen her path to victory," Emily Seidel, the C.E.O. of Americans for Prosperity Action, wrote in an internal memo. The network, which had spent tens of millions backing Haley in an effort to derail Trump's march to the G.O.P. nomination, now plans to focus on supporting Republicans in congressional races.
By any measure, the delegate math is rough for Haley. She's expected to lose Michigan's primary on Tuesday, as well as virtually every contest through Super Tuesday. Moreover, South Carolina and many upcoming primaries will award most or all of their delegates to the winner, which means Trump.
But Haley still has money in the bank, enough for a half-million-dollar ad buy in Michigan.
What will Haley's other major donors do? They have included Stanley Druckenmiller, Henry Kravis and Ken Langone -- who have stayed largely quiet since her defeat on Saturday. Many of them had hoped to prop her up as a Trump alternative, but also had been looking for some sign that their efforts wouldn't be in vain.
There are signs that some donors are sticking with Haley. Her campaign announced that it had raised $ 1 million within 24 hours of losing South Carolina. (Haley's campaign said those were from "grass-roots conservatives.")
The hedge fund mogul Cliff Asness, a Haley supporter, sees trouble ahead for Trump: In a defiant electoral analysis on X on Sunday, he noted that at least 40 percent of voters in the South Carolina and New Hampshire primaries voted against him. Notably, however, Asness didn't say whether he'd continue to give Haley money.
Social media in the dock
The Supreme Court will hear two closely watched cases on Monday that could dictate the future of social media and inflict big financial and regulatory changes on companies like Facebook, YouTube and X.
What are the cases about? Florida and Texas passed laws in 2021 that accused tech companies of having a liberal bias in censoring conservative views following the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol.
Big Tech is fighting back. The trade groups NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association sued to prevent the laws from taking effect. They say the First Amendment gives companies the right to remove content in accordance with their editorial policies. Section 230 of the Community Decency Act also mandates that social media companies aren't liable for most of the content their users publish. The justices upheld that protection last year.
The fight comes against a broader battle over information online. The left and right have assailed tech companies for not doing enough to police disinformation, hate speech and harassment on their platforms.
Critics say the Texas and Florida laws could allow users to publish extremist content -- from neo-Nazis, say -- more easily.
Yet even some liberal legal experts say the Supreme Court must tread carefully. Zephyr Teachout at Fordham and others urged the justices not to treat the platforms like news outlets in a brief filed to the court. "This case threatens to be another expansion of corporate speech rights," Teachout told the Times. "It may end up in fact being a Trojan horse, because the sponsors of the legislation are so distasteful. We should be really wary of expanding corporate speech rights just because we don't like particular laws."
ICYMI: A cheat sheet for Buffett's investor letter
This past weekend, Warren Buffett published the message his millions of followers wait for every year: his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway's investors, outlining his thoughts on the company and its prospects, the economy and more.
A few things popped out to DealBook as especially noteworthy.
The era of "eye-popping performance" at Berkshire is over, Buffett wrote:
There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can't. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.
Berkshire reported its best-ever annual earnings on Saturday, yet Buffett conceded that it's nearly impossible to strike a transformational megadeal now. That means Berkshire's enormous cash hoard, what Buffett has called his "elephant gun," will only grow bigger.
That said, if Buffett wanted to use that cash -- which stood at about $ 163 billion -- he could buy an array of prominent businesses that fit at least some of his investment criteria. Think Starbucks, Lowe's or Lockheed Martin.
Buffett blames regulators for some underperformance. From his description of Berkshire Hathaway Energy's results:
The regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or even bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California's largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii). In such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once regarded as among the most stable industries in America.
And from his discussion of the BNSF railroad's higher labor costs:
"Wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country's inflation goals."
Both were unusual examples of Buffett -- who has spoken out in favor of Democratic efforts like raising taxes on the wealthy -- decrying government regulations. (DealBook reviewed his annual letters dating back to 1978; he has rarely talked about regulation at length, and usually did so in neutral or positive terms.)
The regulatory challenges undercut a message Buffett has written several times about BNSF and the power business: Governments and those industries essentially struck a bargain in which predictable regulation would beget predictable profit. As he put it in his 2011 letter, "Wise regulation and wise investment are two sides of the same coin."
Buffett's letter suggested he may rethink that, and instead curtail Berkshire business in certain states. "We will not knowingly throw good money after bad," he wrote.

Want an Insta-Worthy Wedding? Brand Your Love Story.: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some couples are going above and beyond to personalize their weddings, with bespoke party favors and custom experiences for guests.
At Michelle Bonnice and Colton Flores's wedding in Austin, Texas, in September, guests were given custom menus with a thank-you note from the couple; drank espresso martinis from an ice luge with the letters "M" and "C" carved into its side; and left with party favors of koozies featuring an illustration of their dog.
It was all part of Ms. Bonnice and Mr. Flores's vision for their nuptials. "I wanted guests to feel like they were being invited to our event, for me and my husband, with our brand showing who we are," said Ms. Bonnice, a 30-year-old engineer at Salesforce.
Like Ms. Bonnice and her husband, many couples are choosing to have so-called branded weddings, in which numerous elements are customized with a couple's logo, illustration or other personal touch. They can range from small details, such as monogrammed place settings, to larger, more elaborate endeavors, like light fixtures that beam bespoke designs onto the dance floor. According to a recent survey by The Knot of nearly 10,000 couples, 63 percent felt that personalization was the most important part of their planning process.
To make their branding dreams a reality, Ms. Bonnice and Mr. Flores worked with planners at Simply XO Events, a wedding planning company in Austin, who created a nine-page inspiration board with various designs and suggestions for personalization. They ordered items from Etsy and other vendors, some free (a logo on guests' photo booth pictures) and others on the pricier side. (Custom graphics displayed in front of two bars were over $ 2,000.) The end result "turned out great," Ms. Bonnice said. Her only regret? Not having their logo appear on the aisle during the ceremony, too. "If I could have afforded that, having another custom moment there would've been really cool," she said.
For some couples, the purpose of a branded wedding is to have a clear, cohesive representation of their shared values and their lives together. Others hope to stand out in a sea of cookie-cutter events or emulate the high-end look of celebrity weddings -- and many are willing to shell out the money to do so.
Becca Atchison, the founding partner and creative director of Rebecca Rose Events in North Carolina, said it was not uncommon for couples to dedicate 25 to 40 percent of their budgets to branding alone. Trista Croce, the founder and chief executive of BTS Event Management in Phoenix, often sees clients pay "anywhere from $ 6,000 to $ 15,000" on branding, she said. And Nico and Lala, an online company specializing in branded weddings, offers customization packages starting at $ 1,000, with logo creation among its more expensive options.
"Most of our couples are looking for branding to truly elevate the look and feel of their wedding," said Lauren Perkins, the sales and marketing director for Nico and Lala.
Any aspect of a wedding can be branded, Ms. Atchison said: "The sky's the limit." For her team, the process can start long before the big day, as clients often also want logos on their save-the-dates, websites with specific fonts and patterns and custom bridesmaid and groomsman proposal boxes. "Couples are looking for a level of customization that is so far beyond what was out there even as recently as five or six years ago," she said.
Millennials and Generation Z are leading the branding charge, said Allison Cullman, the vice president for brand marketing and strategy at Zola. One primary reason for this, she said, is social media. Young people "care more about what their wedding will look like in a social feed" than older generations do, Cullman said.
"Weddings have become a competition -- who had the best details, who had the best band, who had the best food, all these things," said Nicole Killeen, 30, a media strategist in Middletown, N.J., whose wedding in June included several branded elements. She and her husband, Christopher Corley, a sales executive, decided to have customized cornhole boards and napkins featuring their initials, and personalized matchboxes.
"It wasn't that I was trying to blow everyone's wedding out of the water," she said. "I'm not Kim Kardashian -- I don't have that kind of influence on people." Still, seeing other couples' branded weddings on social media made her want to put on a standout event. "I'm a competitive person," she added.
Some branded weddings do go viral on social media -- which can motivate couples to put in the extra effort. "I've met a couple of brides who posted a few photos of their weddings and now they're full-time lifestyle interviewers, just from doing that," said Mackenzie Rising, a 27-year-old digital strategist in Dallas who offers wedding branding consultations for couples.
Couples on a tighter budget might choose the do-it-yourself route or other more affordable options. Ms. Killeen, for example, used the online design service Canva to create a logo, which she added to their invitations, wedding signs and seating chart with a Cricut printing machine. For any items she couldn't brand herself, such as matchboxes for favors, she uploaded the logo to the custom goods site For Your Party, which then printed it onto her chosen items. The most popular custom items on For Your Party include cocktail napkins and matchboxes, said Sari Mintz, the company's owner, who added that customers spent an average of $ 500 to $ 1,000 per order on branded goods.
Although creating so many personalized touches took a lot of time and energy, it was worth it to Ms. Killeen. The branded elements made the wedding "feel special and unique and gave it a little more of a luxurious feel for everybody that got to enjoy our day with us," she said.
There are some drawbacks, however, especially for couples putting on D.I.Y. branded weddings without the help of professional planners. The more custom items you order, wedding experts say, the higher the chance for quality issues, shipping troubles and wide-scale mistakes. Ms. Croce of BTS recalled incorporating one groom's family crest into dozens of details, only to discover on the wedding day that her team had been sent the wrong version of the image. The groom wasn't fazed, but "my heart dropped into my stomach deeper than you could ever imagine," she said.
The potential for day-of disasters aside, most couples are happy with the results. Dianna Hughes, a 33-year-old marketing consultant in Miami, was elated when videos of her branded wedding earned over 257,000 views on TikTok. The three-day event, held in Lake Como, Italy, in July 2023, featured a custom newspaper with a front-page headline announcing the couple's nuptials, candles hand-painted with the names of their guests, sweatshirts embroidered with their personalized logo and more. Seven months later, Ms. Hughes is still in awe of the scope of the branding and its impact on the entire event.
"People literally tell me to this day, even if they didn't come to my wedding and have just seen it on the internet, that they've never seen details like what we did," Ms. Hughes said.

Inside a Funding Frenzy at Anthropic: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Last May, Anthropic, one of the world's hottest artificial intelligence start-ups, raised $ 450 million from investors including Google and Salesforce. It was the beginning of an astonishing funding spree.
By August, Anthropic had landed $ 100 million from two Asian telecoms. Then Amazon committed $ 4 billion to it, followed by $ 2 billion more from Google.
This month, the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures closed a deal to invest $ 750 million in Anthropic.
All told, the A.I. start-up hauled in $ 7.3 billion in a year. Its five funding deals stood out not just for their speed and size, but for their unusual structures.
In one of those deals, Anthropic agreed to use technology such as chips and cloud computing services from the companies that invested in it. That meant, in effect, that some of the money it raised would be pumped back into its investors. And to consolidate smaller investors who were interested in Anthropic, Menlo created a legal entity known as a "special purpose vehicle."
"These deals are so complicated," said Dave Brown, an Amazon Web Services vice president who was involved in Amazon's deal with Anthropic.
For all of A.I.'s promise of transforming every aspect of society, it has started by upending Silicon Valley's start-up deal-making. Young companies typically raise money every 15 months or so, after showing that their businesses have grown. But since generative A.I. -- which can generate text, images, sounds and video -- burst onto the scene in late 2022, the rule book has been thrown out as investors have fought for a piece of the hottest developers.
Few companies better illustrate that shift than Anthropic, which makes a chatbot called Claude and sells various forms of its A.I. technology. Over the last year, the start-up's valuation has tripled to $ 15 billion, three people with knowledge of its finances said. It hit roughly $ 8 million in monthly revenue last year and expects that to grow by around eightfold this year, two of the people said.
Other A.I. start-ups, including OpenAI, Character.AI and Cohere, have struck similar kinds of investment deals as they race to collect the most money, form the most lucrative partnerships, hire the best talent and get access to the most computer chips. OpenAI recently completed a deal that values it at $ 80 billion or more.
Investors cannot afford to lose out on the action because "if you miss the winner in the space, you're kind of out of the game," said Ilya Strebulaev, a finance professor at Stanford.
Some investments in A.I. start-ups by the tech giants have recently attracted regulatory attention. Last month, the Federal Trade Commission said it had opened an inquiry into Amazon's and Google's investments in Anthropic for potential antitrust violations.
A spokeswoman for Anthropic said it planned to cooperate with the F.T.C. The company declined to comment further. Anthropic's funding from Menlo Ventures was reported earlier by The Information.
Since founding Anthropic in 2021, Dario Amodei, the chief executive, and his sister, Daniela Amodei, the president, have positioned it as a start-up that would build A.I. with guardrails. In a podcast interview last year, Dario Amodei said there was a 10 to 25 percent chance that A.I. technology could destroy humanity.
But if that doesn't happen, he said, "it'll go not just fine, it'll go really, really great."
From the start, Anthropic's funding has been unconventional. In 2021, it raised $ 124 million from investors including Jaan Tallinn, an entrepreneur known for focusing on the existential risks of technology, as well as the Center for Emerging Risk Research, a Swiss nonprofit that aims to "build a future guided by wisdom and compassion for all sentient beings." (The group has changed its name to Polaris Ventures.)
In 2022, Anthropic raised $ 580 million for research on building powerful A.I. technologies and working to ensure that they did not cause harm. Most of that sum -- which dwarfed what venture capitalists had invested in other A.I. start-ups -- came from Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, and his colleagues. They belonged to a community known as effective altruists, which has long viewed A.I. as an existential risk.
When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 and control of its assets was handed to new management, Anthropic was left with an uncertain future. Its prospects reversed days later when OpenAI released the A.I.-powered chatbot ChatGPT. The technology that underpinned ChatGPT was developed largely by Dario Amodei and others who had worked at OpenAI before leaving to create Anthropic.
That brought attention to Anthropic, and Google made its first investment. Anthropic also agreed to buy computing power through Google's cloud computing service, which it uses to train and serve its technologies.
In September, Amazon inked a similar deal with Anthropic, investing up to $ 4 billion. Anthropic's Claude chatbot was the most popular A.I. service offered on Amazon's cloud computing system, Amazon Web Services, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
As part of the pact, Anthropic agreed to build its A.I. using specialized computer chips designed by Amazon. If Anthropic is a success, Amazon's shares in the start-up could pay off handsomely. In the meantime, the cloud computing deal will lift Amazon's bottom line.
The deal was structured as convertible notes, or debt that becomes equity when Anthropic hits certain milestones, two people familiar with the structure said.
Amazon's funding of Anthropic mirrored the way OpenAI raised money. In 2019, OpenAI garnered $ 1 billion from Microsoft and spent most of the money buying computing power through Microsoft's Azure cloud service. Microsoft has since poured an additional $ 12 billion into the company, and OpenAI has spent most of the money on Microsoft's cloud services.
(The Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging copyright infringement.)
Some investors have questioned such deals because companies like Google and Amazon are investing money that ends up bolstering their own revenues. The companies said the arrangements were kosher.
Google's investment in Anthropic is separate from the start-up's agreement to use its cloud services, said Daniel Gabis, a Google spokesman. They have "always been separate," he said.
Amazon appropriately accounts for all revenue and expenses, said Casey McGee, an Amazon spokesman. "Suggesting otherwise, or that AWS's agreement with Anthropic is anything but a normal business agreement, is entirely false," he said.
Even after raising billions from Amazon and Google, Anthropic knew it would eventually need more money. Generative A.I. start-ups are constantly updating, refining and expanding their technology to make their product accurate, up-to-date and more powerful, and that requires enormous amounts of expensive computational power.
Finding new investors was easy for Anthropic. But many of those who were interested wanted to invest $ 10 million to $ 25 million, while the company aimed for a much larger sum.
In November, Neerav Kingsland, Anthropic's head of business development, spoke at a conference hosted by Menlo Ventures, which had previously invested. Menlo proposed leading Anthropic's next round of funding, with a twist: What if the firm rolled all of the small investors into one special purpose vehicle?
The arrangement would save Anthropic time and simplify the process. Mr. Kingsland and Anthropic's founders agreed, a person with knowledge of the talks said.
Anthropic told investors that $ 15 billion was the lowest valuation it would accept, two people familiar with the situation said.
After collecting the $ 750 million this month, Anthropic is no longer running a formal process to raise money, a person familiar with the situation said. But investors may soon get another opportunity.
As part of FTX's bankruptcy proceedings this month, the crypto firm asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware for permission to sell its 8 percent stake in Anthropic. FTX's lawyers said they sought to move quickly to sell the shares alongside upcoming rounds of Anthropic funding.
It was FTX's understanding "that Anthropic will continue to seek additional rounds of equity financing," the lawyers wrote.

A Grim Look At the State Of the News: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mass layoffs, closures and reader fatigue are afflicting news organizations as Americans prepare for a consequential election year.
Even by the standards of a news business whose fortunes have plummeted in the digital age, the last few weeks have been especially grim for American journalism.
Prominent newspapers like The Washington Post are shedding reporters and editors, and on Tuesday, The Los Angeles Times laid off more than 20 percent of its newsroom. Cable news ratings have fallen amid an uncompetitive presidential primary contest. Esteemed titles like Sports Illustrated, already a shadow of their former selves, have been gutted overnight.
As Americans prepare for an election year that will feature disinformation wars, A.I.-generated agitprop and a debate over the future of democracy, the mainstream news industry -- once the de facto watchdog and facilitator of public discourse -- is struggling to stay afloat.
The pain is particularly pronounced at the community level. An average of five local newspapers are closing every two weeks, according to Northwestern University's Medill School, with more than half of all American counties now so-called news deserts with limited access to news about their hometowns. Of 1,100 public radio stations and affiliates, only about one in five is producing local journalism.
"At a time when America arguably needs more solid news coverage than ever, it is very disturbing to see economic forces arrange so powerfully against traditional news sources," said Andrew Heyward, a former CBS News president who works with a group of M.I.T. researchers studying the future of news and information.
"It's not just disturbing," he added. "It's dangerous."
The decline has gone on for years, but a painful confluence of challenges has resulted in the current carnage.
Americans are suffering from news fatigue, inundated with major stories like the coming election and wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. Those who do follow the news have increasingly turned to social media and anti-establishment sites that exist outside legacy organizations.
Companies are spending more of their ad budgets to reach users on big tech platforms like Instagram and Google -- which in turn have become less reliable in referring readers to traditional news sources. Twitter, now X, shed users and relevance after its chaotic takeover by Elon Musk, while Google and Meta laid off key news employees and the head of Instagram's Threads app said it would not focus on news.
Troubles at the corporate level have also taken a toll.
The rise of streaming and a drop-off in moviegoing have led to belt-tightening at the parent companies of many news outlets. Disney, which owns ABC News, shed thousands of jobs last year. With NBCUniversal losing viewers from its once-formidable cable-TV division, NBC News laid off several dozen employees this month. CNN, owned by debt-laden Warner Bros. Discovery, went through a round of layoffs. Paramount, which owns CBS News, is also planning deep cuts, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.
The New York Times, The New Yorker and The Boston Globe have found success by attracting digital subscribers, and there are some green shoots among niche, subscription-based start-ups that largely focus on a single industry, like The Information for tech and The Ankler for Hollywood.
Still, the onslaught of painful headlines is an ominous sign for the broader news industry's efforts to forge sustainable business models.
The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times appeared poised for comebacks after each newspaper was bought by a tech-savvy billionaire, the sort of financial benefactor the industry hoped could offer a lifeline as print revenue dwindled. Hiring sprees and Pulitzer Prizes followed at both papers.
But both lost tens of millions of dollars last year. This month, Kevin Merida, The Los Angeles Times's widely respected editor, resigned after clashing with the paper's owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong. Then came the extensive layoffs.
"If you care about journalism -- local news, national news, international news -- every warning light should be blinking red," Mary Louise Kelly, a host of NPR's "All Things Considered," wrote on X after word of those layoffs spread.
The Post is cutting costs under its billionaire owner, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The paper surged in popularity during the Trump administration but failed to build on its subscriber growth. Shortly before the new year, The Post announced that 240 employees had accepted buyouts.
The Baltimore Sun, Maryland's largest newspaper, also faces an uncertain future. It was sold this month to David D. Smith, a businessman who runs the conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group. Many reporters at The Sun are concerned that Mr. Smith will impose his political interests on a newspaper that he recently admitted he had barely read in the past 40 years.
The magazine world has not been immune. Last week, Sports Illustrated, once a titan of sports journalism, whose cover was a coveted prize for the world's greatest athletes, said it was laying off much of its entire staff, and its future is in doubt as its owners consider licensing the property to new investors. Days earlier, Condé Nast folded Pitchfork, once a kingmaker among music's smart set, into GQ magazine and laid off employees, including the editor in chief.
On Tuesday, unionized workers at Condé Nast organized a walkout and protest at its World Trade Center headquarters. Time magazine, owned by billionaire Marc Benioff, the Salesforce founder, also began laying off employees this week.
The recent bad news is, in some ways, a continuation from last year. In 2023, Business Insider, The Los Angeles Times and NPR cut at least 10 percent of their staffs; the news division of BuzzFeed was shut down; News Corp cut 1,250 people; National Geographic laid off its remaining staff writers; Vox Media went through two rounds of layoffs; Vice Media filed for bankruptcy; Popular Science shut its online magazine; and ESPN, Condé Nast and Yahoo News all cut jobs.
"A new reality has sunk in among legacy media, both print stalwarts owned by billionaires and some of the high-profile national digital players who won such notice a decade ago," said Ken Doctor, a media entrepreneur and analyst.
Now, the news industry is looking ahead to fresh hurdles posed by the technology of artificial intelligence. Some outlets have expressed concern that A.I. algorithms, which generate impromptu answers to readers' questions, could replace online news sites as go-to sources for current events.
The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, arguing that millions of articles published by The Times were used to train automated chatbots that now compete as providers of information. Some publishers, like Axel Springer, cut deals with OpenAI for annual payments in exchange for the use of their digital archives.
If there's one bright spot, it might be local television news.
Though local TV news stations are enduring their own problems -- heavier workloads for reporters, even as salaries have stagnated -- many remain in better shape than local newspapers, said Mr. Heyward, the former CBS News president, who now works as a consultant to several local news outlets.
"Local TV news has a lot going for it," he said. "Virtually every market of any size has three to four competing newsrooms, which is a stark contrast to the local newspaper, where a market is lucky to have one. And if they do, it's generally a shadow of its former self."
A Gallup and Knight Foundation survey in 2022 found that Americans placed far more trust in local news sources than national media organizations. And just 19 percent of Americans described their trust in journalists as "high" or "very high" in a Gallup survey released this week, a nine-point decrease from four years ago.
"They can't be demonized as fake news," Mr. Heyward said of local outlets. "If there's a traffic light broken at Elm and Maple, people know it, and there are no alternative facts. Americans are having trouble finding common ground, but in a local market, they have it."

Full text: Time magazine, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times -- owned by Marc Benioff, Jeff Bezos and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong -- are still losing money.
There's an old saying about the news business: If you want to make a small fortune, start with a large one.
As the prospects for news publishers waned in the past decade, billionaires swooped in to buy some of the country's most fabled brands. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, bought The Washington Post in 2013 for about $ 250 million. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a biotechnology and start-up billionaire, purchased The Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $ 500 million. Marc Benioff, the founder of the software giant Salesforce, purchased Time magazine with his wife, Lynne, for $ 190 million in 2018.
All three newsrooms greeted their new owners with cautious optimism that their business acumen and tech know-how would help figure out the perplexing question of how to make money as a digital publication.
But it increasingly appears that the billionaires are struggling just like nearly everyone else. Time, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times all lost millions of dollars last year, people with knowledge of the companies' finances have said, after considerable investment from their owners and intensive efforts to drum up new revenue streams.
"Wealth doesn't insulate an owner from the serious challenges plaguing many media companies, and it turns out being a billionaire isn't a predictor for solving those problems," said Ann Marie Lipinski, the curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard. "We've seen a lot of naïve hope attached to these owners, often from employees."
The losses may have the most immediate impact at The Los Angeles Times, where journalists are bracing for bad news. Kevin Merida, the newspaper's widely respected editor, announced last week that he was resigning, a decision made after tension with Dr. Soon-Shiong over editorial and business priorities, according to two people familiar with the matter.
In the middle of last year, The Times was on track to lose $ 30 million to $ 40 million in 2023, according to three people with knowledge of the projections. Last year, the company cut about 74 jobs, and executives have met in recent days to discuss the possibility of deep job cuts, according to two other people familiar with the conversations.
Members of The Los Angeles Times Guild met in an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the possible job cuts. By the end of the day, the workers had planned to walk off the job on Friday in protest.
A spokeswoman for Dr. Soon-Shiong declined to comment on specific financial figures for The Los Angeles Times but said in an email that the company had "a significant gap between revenue and expenses," even with the layoffs and other cost-saving measures from last year.
She said his family had invested "tens of millions of dollars" each year since acquiring The Times. "They are committed to continuing to invest," the spokeswoman, Jen Hodson, said in the statement. "But relying on a benevolent owner to cover expenses, year after year, is not a viable long-term plan."
Mr. Bezos hasn't fared much better at The Washington Post. Like many news organizations, The Post has struggled to hold on to the momentum that it had gained in the wake of the 2020 election. Sagging subscriptions and advertising revenue led to losses of about $ 100 million last year. At the end of the year, the company eliminated 240 of its 2,500 jobs through buyouts, including some of its well-regarded journalists.
Patty Stonesifer, who filled in as chief executive last year, called the buyouts "difficult," but said they were necessary to "invest in our top growth priorities." Employees at The Post sent a letter in recent weeks to their top editor, Sally Buzbee, and their new permanent chief executive, Will Lewis, expressing concern over the lack of research firepower for their articles in the wake of the buyouts.
A spokesman for Mr. Bezos did not respond to repeated requests to arrange an interview for this article. In the past, Mr. Bezos has said he purchased The Post because it was an important institution but wanted the company to be profitable.
"I said to myself, 'If this were a financially upside-down salty snack food company, the answer would be no,"' Mr. Bezos said of his decision to buy The Post in a 2018 interview.
Time is facing similar headwinds. The publication lost around $ 20 million in 2023, according to two people with knowledge of the publication's financial picture. Time has weighed cutting costs in the first quarter of the year to help offset some of the losses, one of the people said.
A Time spokeswoman had no comment on the company's 2023 finances, citing a note to employees from Jessica Sibley, its chief executive, proclaiming growing audiences and advertising revenue. In a statement, Mr. Benioff said Ms. Sibley was making "lots of exciting changes based on an amazing vision."
"We are fortunate to have an amazing new C.E.O., Jessica Sibley, and she has done an incredible job restructuring the company over the last year," Mr. Benioff wrote. "We have never had a bigger year, including Taylor Swift, driven by Jessica's vision for the company."
Time is exploring brand licensing deals overseas, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions, who said the efforts mirrored approaches by magazine companies like Forbes and Condé Nast, which have been reliable moneymakers.
Still, there are some bright spots in the firmament of traditional news organizations owned by billionaires. The Boston Globe, purchased by John W. Henry, the owner of the Boston Red Sox, from The New York Times Company in 2013 for $ 70 million, has been profitable for years, according to a person familiar with the company's finances. Those profits have been reinvested in The Globe, the person said.
The Atlantic, which Laurene Powell Jobs bought in 2017, has set a target of reaching one million combined digital and print subscribers and achieving profitability. The company said it had more than 925,000 subscribers as of last summer, though it was not yet profitable.
The difficulties facing the companies are getting only more severe. Web traffic has waned for many publishers as referrals from search engines like Google ebb, and the rise of new applications powered by artificial intelligence has the potential to erode readership further.
"These vitally important news publications still find themselves 'transitioning' from print to digital -- with major ongoing legacy business costs -- as they build brick by brick a mainly digital future," said Ken Doctor, an analyst and media entrepreneur.
Mr. Doctor said the billionaires in the news industry were showing "greater signs of fatigue," stemming from challenges including "news anxiety and avoidance and fierce advertising competition."
"The very rich find it very difficult to lose money year over year," Mr. Doctor said, "even if they can afford it."

All three newsrooms were cautiously optimistic.

There’s an old saying about the news business: If you want to make a small fortune, start with a large one.
As the prospects for news publishers waned in the last decade, billionaires swooped in to buy some of the country’s most fabled brands. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, bought The Washington Post in 2013 for about $250 million. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a biotechnology and startup billionaire, purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million. Marc Benioff, the founder of software giant Salesforce, purchased Time magazine with his wife, Lynne, for $190 million in 2018.
All three newsrooms greeted their new owners with cautious optimism that their business acumen and tech know-how would help figure out the perplexing question of how to make money as a digital publication.
But it increasingly appears that the billionaires are struggling just like nearly everyone else. Time, The Washington Post and the LA Times all lost millions of dollars last year, people with knowledge of the companies’ finances have said, after considerable investment from their owners and intensive efforts to drum up new revenue streams.
“Wealth doesn’t insulate an owner from the serious challenges plaguing many media companies, and it turns out being a billionaire isn’t a predictor for solving those problems,” said Ann Marie Lipinski, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. “We’ve seen a lot of naive hope attached to these owners, often from employees.”

Patty Stonesifer, who filled in as CEO last year, called the buyouts “difficult” but said they were necessary to “invest in our top growth priorities.” Employees at the Post sent a letter in recent weeks to their top editor, Sally Buzbee, and their new permanent CEO, Will Lewis, expressing concern over the lack of research firepower for their articles in the wake of the buyouts.
A spokesperson for Bezos did not respond to repeated requests to arrange an interview for this article. In the past, Bezos has said he purchased the Post because it was an important institution but wanted the company to be profitable.
“I said to myself, ‘If this were a financially upside-down salty snack food company, the answer would be no,’” Bezos said of his decision to buy the Post in a 2018 interview.
Time is facing similar headwinds. The publication lost around $20 million in 2023, according to two people with knowledge of the publication’s financial picture. Time has weighed cutting costs in the first quarter of the year to help offset some of the losses, one of the people said.
A Time spokesperson had no comment on the company’s 2023 finances, citing a note to employees from CEO Jessica Sibley, proclaiming growing audiences and advertising revenue. In a statement, Benioff said that Sibley was making “lots of exciting changes based on an amazing vision.”
“We are fortunate to have an amazing new CEO, Jessica Sibley, and she has done an incredible job restructuring the company over the last year,” Benioff wrote. “We have never had a bigger year, including Taylor Swift, driven by Jessica’s vision for the company.”
Time is exploring brand licensing deals overseas, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions, who said the efforts mirrored approaches by magazine companies including Forbes and Condé Nast, which have been reliable moneymakers.
There are some bright spots in the firmament of traditional news organizations owned by billionaires. The Boston Globe, purchased by John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox, from The New York Times Co. in 2013 for $70 million, has been profitable for years, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances. Those profits have been reinvested in the Globe, the person said.
The Atlantic, which Laurene Powell Jobs bought in 2017, has set a target of reaching 1 million combined digital and print subscribers and achieving profitability. The company said it has more than 925,000 subscribers as of last summer, although it was not yet profitable.
The difficulties facing the companies are getting only more severe. Web traffic has waned for many publishers as referrals from search engines like Google ebb, and the rise of new applications powered by artificial intelligence has the potential to erode readership further.
“These vitally important news publications still find themselves ‘transitioning’ from print to digital — with major ongoing legacy business costs — as they build brick by brick a mainly digital future,” said Ken Doctor, an analyst and media entrepreneur.
Doctor said the billionaires in the news industry were showing “greater signs of fatigue,” stemming from challenges including “news anxiety and avoidance and fierce advertising competition.”
“The very rich find it very difficult to lose money year over year,” Doctor said, “even if they can afford it.”

There’s an old saying about the news business: If you want to make a small fortune, start with a large one.
As the prospects for news publishers waned in the last decade, billionaires swooped in to buy some of the country’s most fabled brands. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, bought The Washington Post in 2013 for about $250 million. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a biotechnology and startup billionaire, purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018 for $500 million. Marc Benioff, the founder of software giant Salesforce, purchased Time magazine with his wife, Lynne, for $190 million in 2018.
All three newsrooms greeted their new owners with cautious optimism that their business acumen and tech know-how would help figure out the perplexing question of how to make money as a digital publication.
But it increasingly appears that the billionaires are struggling just like nearly everyone else. Time, The Washington Post and the LA Times all lost millions of dollars last year, people with knowledge of the companies’ finances have said, after considerable investment from their owners and intensive efforts to drum up new revenue streams.
“Wealth doesn’t insulate an owner from the serious challenges plaguing many media companies, and it turns out being a billionaire isn’t a predictor for solving those problems,” said Ann Marie Lipinski, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. “We’ve seen a lot of naive hope attached to these owners, often from employees.”
The losses may have the most immediate impact at the LA Times, where journalists are bracing for bad news. Kevin Merida, the newspaper’s widely respected editor, announced last week that he was resigning, a decision made after tension with Soon-Shiong over editorial and business priorities, according to two people familiar with the matter.
In the middle of last year, the LA Times was on track to lose $30 million to $40 million in 2023, according to three people with knowledge of the projections. Last year, the company cut about 74 jobs, and executives have met in recent days to discuss the possibility of deep job cuts, according to two other people familiar with the conversations. Members of the newspaper’s union called an emergency meeting Thursday to discuss the possibility of another “major” round of layoffs: “This is the big one,” read the email to employees.
During the emergency meeting, a guild representative said that after the proposed cuts, the LA Times would be just as small as it was after Soon-Shiong purchased it, reversing years of newsroom expansion.
A spokesperson for Soon-Shiong declined to comment on specific financial figures for the LA Times but said in an email that company had “a significant gap between revenue and expenses,” even with the layoffs and other cost-saving measures from last year.
She said his family had invested “tens of millions of dollars” each year since acquiring the LA Times. “They are committed to continuing to invest,” the spokesperson, Jen Hodson, said in a statement. “But relying on a benevolent owner to cover expenses, year after year, is not a viable long-term plan.”
Bezos hasn’t fared much better at the Post. Like many news organizations, the Post has struggled to hold onto the momentum it gained in the wake of the 2020 election. Sagging subscriptions and advertising revenue led to losses of about $100 million last year. At the end of the year, the company eliminated 240 of its 2,500 jobs through buyouts, including some of its well-regarded journalists.
Patty Stonesifer, who filled in as CEO last year, called the buyouts “difficult” but said they were necessary to “invest in our top growth priorities.” Employees at the Post sent a letter in recent weeks to their top editor, Sally Buzbee, and their new permanent CEO, Will Lewis, expressing concern over the lack of research firepower for their articles in the wake of the buyouts.

A Big Bet on a Pyramid Brings Signs of a Revival to San Francisco: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: From the revamped Transamerica Pyramid to a small public radio station broadcasting from a former copy shop, the street offers hope for recovery in the city.
It seemed like the last place one might invest a billion dollars on an office building in October 2020.
San Francisco's downtown symbolized all that had gone wrong with American cities during the pandemic. The empty office towers. The shops and restaurants boarded up with plywood. The dirty streets, the petty crime, the eerily silent transit stations.
But Michael Shvo, the New York real estate titan, decided there was one building he had to have here, one that has been synonymous with the San Francisco skyline: the Transamerica Pyramid.
Mr. Shvo paid $ 650 million for the tower on San Francisco's Montgomery Street, long hailed as "the Wall Street of the West" for its concentration of financial institutions, including the insurance company after which the triangular skyscraper is named. He then spent another $ 400 million to renovate the tower and turn it into an attraction for businesses and visitors alike.
If his bet pays off, the revamped tower and blocks below could serve as a bellwether for the beleaguered city's recovery and a road map for other downtowns that have struggled to rebound from the pandemic. The key, Mr. Shvo argues, is turning downtowns into spaces where people actually want to be, rather than places their bosses say they have to be.
"I've always believed in San Francisco. The difference was, I was optimistic with a billion-dollar check in my hand," Mr. Shvo said, wearing his customary black T-shirt, black jeans and black sneakers while standing on the 36th floor of the Transamerica Pyramid.
Nearly 200 years ago, Montgomery Street -- or the land beneath it, anyway -- comprised the literal edge of San Francisco. When young gold seekers arrived in 1849 during the first of many booms that would come to define the city, San Francisco added several blocks by piling landfill into the bay. Now, a 15-minute stroll separates Montgomery Street from the shoreline.
A seven-block stretch of Montgomery, from Shvo's pyramid at the north to Market Street at the south, is dotted with "green shoots," the botanical term that economists use to describe early signs of recovery. The street is on the eastern side of the city, in the heart of the Financial District.
From revamped office spaces to a public radio studio with high visibility, Montgomery Street is offering more than "packing and stacking knowledge workers into giant towers," said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies urban development.
Downtowns fare best when they offer a diverse array of music, art, restaurants, shops and gathering places, he explained. Other cities that have emphasized hospitality and entertainment over offices alone, like Austin, Nashville and Miami, have recovered faster from the pandemic than have cities with work-focused downtowns.
"When a place gets boring, even rich people leave," Mr. Florida said. "San Francisco is already starting its rebound."
To be sure, the city's downtown has a long way to go. Its office vacancy rate hovers around 36 percent, the highest among major American cities, spelling trouble for foot traffic and tax revenues. Financial forecasts predict that the city could take a decade to get back to normal. And the much-discussed idea of converting office towers into housing has stalled because it is far too expensive, developers say.
"It's going to take time for the market to correct itself, and I think it's going to be a bumpy 12 to 18 months," said Robbie Silver, executive director of the Downtown San Francisco Partnership, which businesses pay to clean and market the neighborhood.
Mr. Silver said he anticipated that property values would sink further and that some building owners could sell for cheap. But he hopes that in the next two years the downtown will have more affordable rents that enable small businesses to thrive in areas like Montgomery Street.
Mr. Shvo is intent on speeding the recovery by bringing amenities such as gyms and bars to lure tenants to the 51-year-old Transamerica Pyramid. He is also turning the drab lobby into a hive of small businesses, with a raised ceiling and wide openings that create passageways for pedestrians. The park outside, rarely visited by locals, will feature furniture and new cherry trees.
He predicts three million visitors a year when the transformation is complete.
This section of San Francisco's downtown isn't the hellscape that one might believe based on some social media videos that have gone viral. Businesses pay the Downtown San Francisco Partnership to powerwash the streets, remove graffiti and pick up trash 14 hours a day, seven days a week.
"I won't say it's back to 2019, but it is totally normal," said the developer Oz Erickson, who recently moved his Emerald Fund offices from one building on Montgomery to a smaller, cheaper one across the street.
Sometimes, he said with glee, the street even features the epitome of prepandemic life: traffic jams.
The architecture firm
In the decade before the pandemic, sleek office towers were in high demand, as tech companies and other businesses flocked to the South of Market neighborhood, or SoMa, blocks away from the Financial District.
But some firms say that they are now drawn to offices that have more charm and history on Montgomery Street. Until recently, Gensler, a global architecture firm, spread its workers across three high floors of a more modern SoMa building near Salesforce Tower. But with cheaper rents available postpandemic, the firm moved to the historic Mills Building, three blocks from the pyramid.
Gensler's architects designed not only the perfect office for themselves, but what they hoped would serve as a prototype for other employers. Gensler requires its employees to be in the office five days a week, a rarity in San Francisco.
Now, the firm's 250 employees all work on the large second floor of the Mills Building, making collaboration easier, and they have close-up views of the street life outside. The windows open, allowing fresh air to enter.
The front door opens onto a giant room that looks more like a posh apartment than an office. To the right are comfortable couches and modern desks. Shelves are dotted with plants, books and the original Rolodex that belonged to Art Gensler, the company's founder. To the left is a kitchen with a marble island, an espresso machine, free snacks and taps offering lemonade, beer and kombucha.
Farther back, the workspaces grow progressively darker and more private, and an employee can decide which among them fits the mood on a given day.
Miao Wang, a 28-year-old architect at Gensler, said that San Francisco's downtown felt dull and empty when the firm was at its previous office tower. Now, she said, she sees pedestrians scrambling across intersections, smells morning coffee and bacon and hears buskers playing the guitar and saxophone.
"It just feels so nice," she said. "I hope more people come back."
The public radio pop-up
In the same Mills Building, on the ground floor where a copy shop once operated, the staff of the public radio station KALW now records its shows and hosts happy hours, quiz shows and poetry nights.
KALW is participating in a new effort launched by the city and a small business nonprofit, SF New Deal, that convinces landlords to give up empty retail space for three months to tenants for creative uses. The program, Vacant to Vibrant, has attracted bakeries, boutiques and artists' studios.
James Kass, the executive director of KALW, said that pedestrians have regularly popped into the station to check out its temporary space. But, he noted, the station had to spend far more than the $ 8,000 it received in a city grant to make the space functional, such as adding booths that block out the sound of flushing toilets.
Sandra Halladey, an intern at KALW, said that she hoped the city could figure out how to convert empty office space into long-term housing for artists and workers who have been priced out of the city.
"If we're not inviting those kinds of people to live here, we've lost," Ms. Halladey said.
Wade Rose, the president of Advance SF, a business group that aims to revive San Francisco, said that unique shops and experiences were the norm before the downtown area became a more sterile office-centered environment, dotted with chain retailers.
"The unique stores left because rent got too high," he said. "We need to support very interesting, human experiences, and you're starting to see glimmers of that."
The public plaza
A half-block off Montgomery Street, between the radio station and the Transamerica Pyramid, an alley next to an electric substation has been turned into a public plaza called Landing at Leidesdorff.
It sports a giant mural honoring William Leidesdorff, a businessman who arrived here in 1841 and is considered San Francisco's Black founding father. Outdoor furniture and lighting have been added, and live music and fitness classes have been offered.
On a recent night, dozens of people sat in lawn chairs watching a trippy, winter-themed light show that was projected onto the substation facade.
"Downtown has often felt stuffy and stiff, the place where people stuck in offices go," said Suzy Garren, a 50-year-old landscaper who lives in Oakland, adding that she rarely had any reason to venture to the neighborhood. "This is 2023's version of what makes San Francisco cool and interesting."
And then she uttered words perhaps never before used to describe the Financial District.
"It reminds me," she said, "of Burning Man."

But some firms say that they are now drawn to offices that have more charm and history on Montgomery Street. Until recently, Gensler, a global architecture firm, spread its workers across three high floors of a more modern SoMa building near Salesforce Tower. But with cheaper rents available post-pandemic, the firm moved to the historic Mills Building, three blocks from the pyramid.
Gensler’s architects designed not only the perfect office for themselves but also what they hoped would serve as a prototype for other employers. Gensler requires its employees to be in the office five days a week, a rarity in San Francisco.
Now the firm’s 250 employees all work on the large second floor of the Mills Building, making collaboration easier, and they have close-up views of the street life outside. The windows open, allowing fresh air to enter.
The front door opens onto a giant room that looks more like a posh apartment than an office. To the right are comfortable couches and modern desks. Shelves are dotted with plants, books and the original Rolodex that belonged to Art Gensler, the company’s founder. To the left is a kitchen with a marble island, an espresso machine, free snacks and taps offering lemonade, beer and kombucha.
Farther back, the workspaces grow progressively darker and more private, and an employee can decide which among them fits the mood on a given day.
Miao Wang, a 28-year-old architect at Gensler, said that San Francisco’s downtown felt dull and empty when the firm was at its previous office tower. Now, she said, she sees pedestrians scrambling across intersections, smells morning coffee and bacon and hears buskers playing the guitar and saxophone.
“It just feels so nice,” she said. “I hope more people come back.”
The Public Radio Pop-Up
In the same Mills Building, on the ground floor where a copy shop once operated, the staff of the public radio station KALW now records its shows and hosts happy hours, quiz shows and poetry nights.
KALW is participating in a new effort launched by the city and a small business nonprofit, SF New Deal, that convinces landlords to give up empty retail space for three months to tenants for creative uses. The program, Vacant to Vibrant, has attracted bakeries, boutiques and artists’ studios.
James Kass, the executive director of KALW, said that pedestrians have regularly popped into the station to check out its temporary space. But, he noted, the station had to spend far more than the $8,000 it received in a city grant to make the space functional, such as adding booths that block out the sound of flushing toilets.
Sandra Halladey, an intern at KALW, said that she hoped the city could figure out how to convert empty office space into long-term housing for artists and workers who have been priced out of the city.
“If we’re not inviting those kinds of people to live here, we’ve lost,” Halladey said.
Wade Rose, the president of Advance SF, a business group that aims to revive San Francisco, said that unique shops and experiences were the norm before the downtown area became a more sterile, office-centered environment, dotted with chain retailers.
“The unique stores left because rent got too high,” he said. “We need to support very interesting, human experiences, and you’re starting to see glimmers of that.”
The Public Plaza
A half-block off Montgomery Street, between the radio station and the Transamerica Pyramid, an alley next to an electric substation has been turned into a public plaza called Landing at Leidesdorff.
It sports a giant mural honoring William Leidesdorff, a businessperson who arrived here in 1841 and is considered San Francisco’s Black founding father. Outdoor furniture and lighting have been added, and live music and fitness classes have been offered.
On a recent night, dozens of people sat in lawn chairs watching a trippy, winter-themed light show that was projected onto the substation facade.
“Downtown has often felt stuffy and stiff, the place where people stuck in offices go,” said Suzy Garren, a 50-year-old landscaper who lives in Oakland, adding that she rarely had any reason to venture to the neighborhood. “This is 2023’s version of what makes San Francisco cool and interesting.”
And then she uttered words perhaps never before used to describe the Financial District.
“It reminds me,” she said, “of Burning Man.”

Full text: A mix of prominent tech industry figures and people not well known outside the A.I. community played big roles in the upheaval at the company.
On Nov. 17, Silicon Valley tumbled into turmoil when Sam Altman, chief executive of the high-profile A.I. start-up OpenAI, was suddenly removed by the company's board of directors. After a five-day roller-coaster ride that encapsulated the increasingly heated battle over the future of artificial intelligence, Mr. Altman was reinstated and a new board was created. Here is a list of players in the year's biggest tech drama:
Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive and a founder: Mr. Altman founded OpenAI as a nonprofit lab with Elon Musk and several others in 2015, while serving as the president of Y Combinator, a powerful Silicon Valley start-up incubator. He took over as chief executive in 2018, attached the lab to a for-profit company and soon raised $ 1 billion in funding from Microsoft.
Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president and a founder: After dropping out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Brockman was the chief technology officer at Stripe, an online payment company that Mr. Altman helped incubate. He was among OpenAI's 12 founders, saying the lab would build A.I. that was free from the corporate pressures that drove Google and other tech giants.
Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist and a founder: Dr. Sutskever was among three researchers at the University of Toronto who launched the A.I. boom in 2012 when they published a paper showing that machines could learn to identify objects in images with surprising accuracy. After joining Google, he defected to join Mr. Altman, Mr. Brockman and others in founding OpenAI.
Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer: Ms. Murati joined OpenAI in 2018 and later became its chief technology officer. When four OpenAI board members -- Dr. Sutskever, Adam D'Angelo, Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley -- decided to remove Mr. Altman as chief executive, they asked Ms. Murati to briefly serve as interim chief executive.
Adam D'Angelo, OpenAI board member: As a student at Phillips Exeter Academy, he built an online music player alongside Mark Zuckerberg, the future founder of Facebook. After serving as Facebook's chief technology officer from 2006 to 2008, he founded the question-and-answer site Quora. He joined the OpenAI board of directors in 2018 and remains chief executive of Quora.
Helen Toner, former OpenAI board member: Ms. Toner joined the board in 2021. She identifies as an effective altruist, part of a community of people who believe that A.I. could one day destroy humanity. She is also a director of strategy at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, a think tank, where she writes about national security issues. She left the board as part of the agreement to bring Mr. Altman back to the company.
Tasha McCauley, former OpenAI board member: Ms. McCauley is an adjunct senior management scientist at the RAND Corporation, one of the country's oldest think tanks, and serves on the British board of Effective Ventures, a federation of organizations dedicated to effective altruism. In 2015, she attended a seminal A.I. safety summit in Puerto Rico alongside Mr. Musk and others. She, too, left the OpenAI board when Mr. Altman returned.
Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive: Mr. Nadella bumped into Mr. Altman in 2018 at the Sun Valley Conference, often called "summer camp for billionaires." In the year that followed, Mr. Nadella and Microsoft agreed to invest $ 1 billion in OpenAI. They have since invested an additional $ 12 billion.
Brian Chesky, Airbnb's chief executive: Mr. Chesky's company is another tech start-up that Mr. Altman helped incubate. After Mr. Altman was ousted from OpenAI -- and decided that he would find a way of returning to the company -- Mr. Chesky was among the many friends and colleagues who helped make it happen.
Emmett Shear, former chief executive of Twitch: Mr. Shear founded Justin.tv, yet another start-up Mr. Altman helped incubate. He later served as chief executive of Twitch, a company spun out of Justin.tv. He is among those who believe that A.I. could one day destroy humanity. Mr. Shear also briefly served as OpenAI's interim chief executive.
Bret Taylor, new OpenAI board chairman: Mr. Taylor is the former co-chief executive of Salesforce.com and another former chief technology officer for Facebook. He was also the chair of Twitter when Mr. Musk bought it. As part of the agreement to return Mr. Altman to OpenAI, Mr. Taylor joined the OpenAI board and took over as chairman.
Lawrence H. Summers, new OpenAI board member: Mr. Summers is one of the country's most prominent economists. He served as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, and has been speaking out about the potential for A.I. to displace workers. But his reputation has been damaged over the years. While serving as president of Harvard, he said women might lack an intrinsic aptitude for math and science.
Ron Conway, Silicon Valley investor: Mr. Conway is a well-known venture capitalist and longtime friend of Mr. Altman's. With Mr. Chesky, he helped persuade Mr. Altman to push his way back into OpenAI. This week, he sent a text to Mr. Altman urging him to silence speculation about why he was removed from the OpenAI board.

Spotify to Cut 1,500 Jobs In Third Round of Layoffs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The music streaming service has expanded into podcasting and audiobooks but found it difficult to turn a consistent profit.
Spotify said on Monday that it would cut nearly a fifth of its work force, its third round of layoffs so far this year, as it has struggled to become consistently profitable after spending aggressively to expand beyond music streaming into areas such as podcasting.
Spotify's chief executive, Daniel Ek, wrote in a note to employees posted on the company's website that the platform now needed to "rightsize" to account for a "very different environment." Spotify, which is based in Stockholm, will let go of about 1,500 people, or 17 percent of its staff.
"Economic growth has slowed dramatically and capital has become more expensive," Mr. Ek said. "Despite our efforts to reduce costs this past year, our cost structure for where we need to be is still too big."
Spotify's cuts come as the technology industry reckons with the end of a decade of rock-bottom interest rates that propelled their growth, prompting the industry's giants like Amazon, Meta and Salesforce to cut costs and shed jobs. Monday's moves, Mr. Ek said, were about "preparing for our next phase, where being lean is not just an option but a necessity."
Despite being the largest music streaming platform, Spotify has long struggled to be profitable because of the terms of licensing deals it has with record labels and music publishers. The company has pushed into new areas like podcasting, including buying the podcast studios Gimlet for $ 230 million in 2019 and The Ringer for about $ 200 million in 2020. It struck expensive deals with well-known figures such as former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, as well as Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan. More recently, the company has expanded into audiobooks.
The shifts have helped Spotify attract listeners and subscribers, but have not been a financial breakthrough. In the first nine months of 2023, Spotify lost $ 462 million, more than double the loss in the same period in 2022.
But the company turned a small profit last quarter, its first in more than a year, in what Paul Vogel, its chief financial officer, at the time called "an important inflection point for the business."
Spotify had 226 million paying subscribers at the end of September and is on track to add 30 million for the full year, 50 percent more than it expected at the outset of 2023. The company recently raised prices for its subscriptions in more than 50 countries.
Spotify also has more than 360 million monthly active users whose accounts are supported by advertising. This segment has been growing faster than paid subscriptions, but it generates less revenue at a lower profit margin for the company.
The jobs cuts are the largest Spotify has announced this year. In June, Spotify cut about 200 jobs, including many involved in podcasting. Another 600 employees were let go in January.
As part of its severance package for the job cuts announced on Monday, Spotify said an average employee would receive about five months of pay.
There is little concern among investors that the company will be "cutting into the muscle" with the job reductions, said Benjamin Black, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.
The round of layoffs was not a surprise, but it was sooner and larger than expected, he said. The move was welcomed by investors, who are eager to see the company more consistently turn a profit.
Spotify's shares, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, jumped more than 7 percent on Monday, extending gains the company has made this year, partly reversing a long slide from a peak in early 2021. The company's share price has more than doubled this year.
"In investors' minds, this represents a turning point in terms of how serious the company is" about reaching profit goals, Mr. Black said. "This shows you that they are very, very serious."

AbbVie to Pay $ 10 Billion for Ovarian Cancer Drug
AbbVie will pay around $ 10 billion to add a potential blockbuster cancer treatment as cheaper versions of the drugmaker's all-time best seller, Humira, cut into sales. But company leaders cautioned Thursday that a return on the deal they announced for drug developer ImmunoGen will take time to develop. The company said it would pay $ 31.26 in cash for each ImmunoGen share. The deal delivers Elahere, an ImmunoGen ovarian cancer treatment that AbbVie says could eventually reap billions of dollars in annual sales and drive longterm revenue growth. U.S. regulators granted Elahere an accelerated approval last year, and the company is seeking a full approval from the Food and Drug Administration as well as expansion in other markets. It also plans to expand Elahere's use. Elahere brought in $ 105.2 million in revenue in the third quarter, or nearly all of ImmunoGen's total sales. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Salesforce Sales Jump on Strong Cloud Demand
Salesforce's stock jumped by about 10 percent on Thursday to a nearly two-year high after the U.S. cloud and business software company reported stellar third-quarter results underpinned by strong demand for its services. Salesforce's revenue of $ 8.72 billion and adjusted profit of $ 2.11 per share beat Wall Street expectations, the company reported after the closing bell on Wednesday. It also forecast that fourth-quarter revenue would reach between $ 9.18 billion and $ 9.23 billion, and adjusted profit to range from $ 2.25 to $ 2.26 per share, higher than analyst estimates. Shares of Salesforce climbed 9.6 percent to as high as $ 252.50, hitting their highest level since January 2022 and on track for the biggest daily percent gain since March this year. The stock was last up about 7 percent, adding approximately $ 16 billion to Salesforce's market capitalization. REUTERS

China's Factory Output Fell Again in November
An official survey of Chinese manufacturers shows that factory activity contracted for a second straight month in November, an indicator of weak demand despite various stimulus measures aimed at supporting the economy. The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell to 49.4 in November, down slightly from October's 49.5, according to data released Thursday by the National Bureau of Statistics. A figure below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing activity while a number above 50 reflects an expansion, on a scale up to 100. The index has fallen in seven of the last eight months, with an increase only in September. Despite prolonged weakness after the pandemic, the economy is expected to grow at about a 5 percent annual pace this year. China's recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic faltered after an initial burst of growth early in the year faded more quickly than expected. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Back at OpenAI Helm, Altman Outlines Company's Priorities: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a blog post, Mr. Altman said he would focus on improving products and building a new board, which added Microsoft as a nonvoting member.
OpenAI said on Wednesday that it had completed the first phase of a new governance structure that added Microsoft as a nonvoting board member, as it works to end the divisions that fueled the ouster of Sam Altman as chief executive and sets itself up for a future as a bigger company.
In a blog post, Mr. Altman, who was rapidly reinstated last week, also outlined his priorities for OpenAI as he retakes the reins of the high-profile artificial intelligence start-up. He said the company would resume its work building safe A.I. systems and products that benefited its customers. He added that its board would focus on improving governance and overseeing an independent review of the events that led to and followed his removal as chief executive.
Microsoft expands a three-person board that OpenAI announced last week. The tech giant is one of OpenAI's biggest investors, having committed $ 13 billion. Microsoft will be able to participate in OpenAI's board meetings but not vote on business decisions.
"Part of what good governance means is that there's more predictability, transparency and input from various stakeholders, and this seemed like a good way to get that from a very important one," Mr. Altman said in an interview, referring to Microsoft.
The blog post was the first extensive commentary from Mr. Altman since the leadership crisis at OpenAI. Four board members fired him on Nov. 17, saying he hadn't been "consistently candid" with them. That set off a frenzy, with more than 700 of OpenAI's 770 employees signing a letter saying they would leave if Mr. Altman didn't return. Within days, he reclaimed his job, and two board members said they would resign.
The drama was scrutinized because OpenAI is one of the most powerful players in artificial intelligence, a rapidly evolving technology that could help people become more productive, potentially displace jobs and be used to spread misinformation. The leadership crisis raised questions about the company's governance structure, which is unusual because a nonprofit board is in control, as well as whether it had outgrown its roots and how it should move forward.
On Wednesday, Mr. Altman and Bret Taylor, a tech executive who has been appointed the new chairman of OpenAI, did not directly address these questions in blog posts. Without providing many specifics, they said the company would build a board that included members with expertise in technology and safety policy.
Mr. Taylor said OpenAI would remain committed to its mission of building artificial intelligence "that is safe and benefits all of humanity."
For the foreseeable future, OpenAI's board will consist of Microsoft; Mr. Taylor, an early Facebook officer and a former co-chief executive of Salesforce; Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary; and Adam D'Angelo, the chief executive of the question-and-answer site Quora, who was among the members who ousted Mr. Altman.
In an interview, Mr. Taylor said he and Mr. Summers would oversee the independent review and select a law firm to conduct the investigation.
Microsoft declined to comment on its board membership.
Mr. Altman said OpenAI had not lost any employees during the leadership crisis. Its executive ranks will look similar to what they were before Mr. Altman's ouster, with Mira Murati returning to her role as chief technology officer. Mr. Altman said Greg Brockman, the company's former chairman, will be his partner and continue in his role as president.
The future of Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist and a founder, is unclear. He was one of the board members who voted for Mr. Altman's removal. Mr. Sutskever later said on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that he regretted his role in the ouster.
In his blog post, Mr. Altman said he harbored "zero ill will towards" Mr. Sutskever and was in discussions with him about "how he can continue his work at OpenAI."

Wall Street Posts Its Strongest Month in Over a Year: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks closed mostly higher on Thursday as the market ended November with its biggest monthly gain in more than a year.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent after drifting between small gains and losses. The benchmark index rose 8.9 percent in November, its biggest monthly gain since July 2022.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.5 percent, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2 percent. Both indexes also posted solid gains for the month, finishing with gains of 8.8 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively.
The market marched steadily higher for much of November as investors grew hopeful that the Federal Reserve is finally done raising interest rates, which fight inflation by slowing the economy. Those hopes got more support with a report that the Fed's preferred measure of inflation cooled last month.
November's rally was also driven largely by the technology sector, where several companies with high values tend to disproportionately impact the market. Microsoft gained 12.1 percent in November, while Nvidia rose 14.7 percent. Also, Treasury yields have generally been falling and easing pressure on stocks. High yields tend to make expensive stocks look less attractive to investors.
Thursday's report from the Commerce Department said prices were unchanged from September to October, down from a 0.4 percent rise the previous month. Compared with a year ago, consumer prices rose 3 percent in October, below the 3.4 percent annual rate in September. That was the lowest year-over-year inflation rate in more than two and a half years.
The Fed's aggressive rate increase policy pushed its benchmark interest rate from near zero in 2022 to its highest level in two decades by the middle of 2023. The goal has been to tame inflation back to the Fed's target rate of 2 percent.
Wall Street is betting that the central bank will continue to hold rates steady at its December meeting and into early 2024, when it could start considering cutting interest rates. Fed officials have hinted at those possibilities, while also saying any future moves will be based on economic data.
The latest data on economic growth and consumer confidence have also raised hopes that the Fed will achieve its sought-after "soft landing," which involves cooling the inflation without throwing the economy into a recession. Meanwhile, the latest round of surprisingly encouraging corporate earnings gave investors more confidence that businesses and the economy can keep humming along.
Treasury yields gained ground on Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 4.34 percent from 4.26 percent late Wednesday.
Traders had their eye on companies reporting quarterly results.
The software company Salesforce jumped 9.4 percent after giving investors a strong profit forecast. The cloud-computing company Snowflake rose 7 percent after also giving Wall Street an encouraging financial forecast.
On the losing end, the data storage company Pure Storage fell 12.2 percent after giving investors a disappointing revenue outlook.
Also Thursday, the Labor Department said slightly more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, but the overall number of people in the United States collecting benefits rose to its highest level in two years. The report shows that the labor market remains strong, but is showing signs of softening.
Oil prices have also been falling, as have gasoline prices in the United States, relieving pressure on consumers. The price of U.S. crude oil fell 2.4 percent on Thursday, despite the latest extension of OPEC's production cuts.
In Europe, the latest data showed that inflation dropped more than expected to 2.4 percent in November, the lowest in more than two years.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The neighborhood, known as New York's first suburb, is a place where 'people want to stay forever.'
Deborah Hallen first visited Brooklyn Heights as a member of an amateur chamber music group. A year later, she moved there. A year after that, following a performance on Staten Island, she met Paul O. Zelinsky, an illustrator of children's books, who, it turned out, also lived in Brooklyn Heights, in his art studio.
"I fell in love at first sight," said Ms. Hallen, 79, of the man she soon married.
That was back in the 1970s. She and Mr. Zelinsky, 70, are now grandparents, but they still live and work in this historic waterfront community, home to many artists and writers. "Back in the day, rents were affordable," she said. "Everybody was everybody's friend."
Ms. Hallen took a job teaching science at P.S. 8, the local public school on Hicks Street, from which she is now retired. She is vice president of Friends of the Brooklyn Heights Branch Library, which raises money for programs at the handsome new library on Cadman Plaza West. In addition to many book events, the library hosts groups for knitting, chess and other pursuits. Ms. Hallen also sits on the Youth, Education and Cultural Affairs Committee of Community Board 2, an appointed position. Mr. Zelinsky, who won the Caldecott Medal in 1998 and has sold millions of copies of his most popular book, "Wheels on the Bus," is part of a circle of illustrators who meet regularly in the neighborhood.
In 1998, the couple and their two daughters left their one-bedroom rental and moved into a two-bedroom, two-bath co-op apartment with views of the harbor and the Brooklyn Bridge, a wood-burning fireplace and a roof deck. They paid $ 320,000. "It's worth over a million dollars now," Ms. Hallen said. "We have no desire to leave. It's beautiful and quiet here."
She likes to walk on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, which overlooks the harbor, and to walk over the Brooklyn or Manhattan Bridge, or take a subway into Manhattan. "It's half an hour to a Broadway show," she said.
Brooklyn Heights has long been known as "New York's first suburb," said Gerard Splendore, an associate broker with Coldwell Banker Warburg, who has lived in three places in Brooklyn Heights. He remembers "sitting next to Norman Mailer in a Chinese restaurant" in the 1980s, when the writer lived and worked in the neighborhood.
"Brooklyn Heights has an amazing housing stock of postwar and prewar buildings and incredible townhouses," Mr. Splendore said. And the recently renovated Brooklyn Bridge Park, he added, "is a huge addition to the area on the waterfront, with soccer, swimming, basketball, restaurants and kayaking."
Among the residents in that area is Doc Dean, 38, a managing director in the corporate investment banking division at Citibank. He and his wife, Amie Dean, 44, a retired executive in the fashion industry, were among the first to move into the Quay condominium in 2020, paying about $ 3 million for a three-bedroom, three-bath apartment. The couple now have a 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son.
"We wanted to be close to my work, and the neighborhood is awesome," Mr. Dean said. His commute involves riding a ferry from Pier 6, steps from his apartment, for "a couple of minutes" to Lower Manhattan, then walking 15 to 20 minutes. His son plays soccer on Pier 5, and his daughter roller skates on Pier 2, attending P.S. 8 and taking after-school chess and art lessons there, too.
The couple are thrilled to be near a lot of great restaurants, he said: "Charlie Mitchell, the first Black Michelin-starred chef in New York City, has his restaurant, Clover Hill, right behind us. It's awesome."
Tom and Kate Gunton, both 33, have been renting on Hicks Street for five years, starting with a one-bedroom and then a two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath apartment in the same building, where they now pay about $ 3,000 a month and live with their 5-month-old daughter and an 85-pound yellow lab.
When they met, Ms. Gunton, who works in health care, was living on the Lower East Side; Mr. Gunton, who works at Salesforce, a software company, had been living abroad. They considered staying on the Lower East Side, but wanted "a bit more space and more amenities," Mr. Gunton said, like an elevator and laundry in the building. They also wanted to be near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which runs below the Promenade, because Ms. Gunton drives to work, and it provides easy access for visits to his family on Long Island and hers in Pennsylvania.
Ms. Gunton takes their daughter to the Promenade "at least once a day," she said. "It's like our backyard." She is also part of an online neighborhood chat group for new mothers, who give each other tips and "exchange baby things." Mr. Gunton plays soccer in an intramural league on Pier 5 and takes their dog to a dog park near Pier 6 or another in Cadman Plaza Park.
"This is not a transient neighborhood," he said. "People want to stay forever."
What You'll Find
Robert A. Levine, a developer who used his initials as the name for his company, RAL, remembers driving past the deteriorating piers and sheds along the Brooklyn Heights waterfront for many years. "They were screaming to me," he said, but no one had been able to develop what he saw as "a hidden gem."
Around 2003, he said, "things were percolating," and he began working with the city and state to build or convert a few new residential buildings -- mostly luxury, but some affordable -- that would contribute some of the funds for the transformation of the piers that has made Brooklyn Bridge Park into a buzzing recreational area. Park construction started in 2008, and the nonprofit Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy now organizes the area's extensive programs.
The new construction represents a small portion of the neighborhood's overall space. The community's northern boundary is Old Fulton Street; its southern boundary is Atlantic Avenue. To the east, Cadman Plaza West curves around, and then Court Street takes over for a short distance. Overlooking the park and the East River, on the west, is the Promenade, a beloved public space that delineates the Heights part of the neighborhood's name. Dumbo is to the north, Cobble Hill to the south and Downtown Brooklyn to the east. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway runs under the Promenade. (The expressway's cantilevered construction has become a cause for concern in recent years, with proposals for short- and long-term repairs unresolved.)
Many streets are lined with leafy trees, handsome townhouses, beautiful churches and other stately buildings, thanks to a 1965 historical designation for nearly all of the neighborhood -- New York City's first such designation. The 1987 movie "Moonstruck" and several others have been filmed there. Many houses were built in the 19th century, and most buildings are low-rise.
"Some people see this as a middle ground between suburbia and New York City," said Ravi Kantha, an associate broker with Leslie J. Garfield.
Montague Street is the main commercial hub.
What You'll Pay
The median price of the 221 homes that sold this year through September was $ 1.19 million, said John Walkup, a founder of UrbanDigs, a real estate data-analytics company. That was close to the median sale price of $ 1.2 million during the same period in 2020, when about the same number of homes sold.
But during the first couple of years of the pandemic, when people wanted more space than Manhattan could offer, "we were off to the races," Mr. Walkup said. In 2021, sales more than doubled, to 485, with a median price of $ 1.45 million; in 2022, there were 408 sales at a median price of $ 1.3 million.
Since then the market has slowed, in part because of higher interest rates. As of mid-November, there were 126 homes for sale on StreetEasy, from a one-bedroom, one-bath co-op on the third floor of a 1950 elevator building at 100 Remsen Street, listed for $ 370,000, to a three-family brownstone built in 1899 at 126 Pierrepont Street, listed for $ 15 million. About 130 rentals were available, from a studio in a walk-up building on State Street, listed for $ 2,195 a month, to a five-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bath townhouse on Remsen Street listed for $ 27,500 a month.
The Vibe
"Community members care a great deal about their history," said Lara Birnback, the executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association. "But at the same time, this is a very vibrant and striving community."
She added: "People are excited that our main street, Montague, has a new energy," with new restaurants, bakeries and other stores -- some of which, like the bookstore Books Are Magic and the bakery L'Appartement 4F, were convinced by the association to open up on Montague Street. The group also played a role in attracting Poppy's, a cafe on Henry Street, and Inga's Bar, which was an NYT Critic's Pick in May 2022.
The Schools
P.S. 8 The Emily Warren Roebling School, at 37 Hicks Street, is the only public school in Brooklyn Heights. It serves students in kindergarten through fifth grade, and had an enrollment of 575 in the school year 2021-22. In 2018-19 (the last year for which ratings are available because of the pandemic), when it was known as the Robert Fulton School and included seventh and eighth grades, 76 percent of students met state standards on the English test, compared with 47 percent citywide, and 71 percent met state stands in math, compared with 46 percent citywide.
In the fall of 2019, students in sixth through eighth grades were moved to a school in Downtown Brooklyn called Bridges MS 915.
Brooklyn Heights is also home to several highly rated private schools, including St. Ann's School and the Packer Collegiate Institute. Brooklyn Heights Montessori School is in nearby Boerum Hill.
The Commute
The 2, 3, 4, 5, A, C and R subway lines all run through the neighborhood. Ferries shuttle people to Manhattan, and many ride bicycles -- or walk -- across the Brooklyn Bridge.
The History
The Brooklyn Heights Association, founded in 1910, is the city's oldest neighborhood association, according to its website. In 1935, the group's advocacy led to the creation of Cadman Plaza Park on the site where the city had demolished the elevated tracks and transit station at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. In 1945, the association opposed a proposed route for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway that would have run through the middle of the neighborhood; instead, a triple cantilever was built at the edge of Brooklyn Heights and topped by the now-popular Brooklyn Heights Promenade. In 1960, the association was on the front lines again, helping to defeat Robert Moses's urban renewal plan to build luxury one-bedroom rentals on Cadman Plaza. Instead, narrower buildings and affordable, family-size co-ops took their place.

In Struggle Over Future of A.I., The Capitalist Perspective Wins: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The fight over OpenAI was at least partly about dueling visions of artificial intelligence. One side clearly won out.
What happened at OpenAI over the past five days could be described in many ways: A juicy boardroom drama, a tug of war over one of America's biggest start-ups, a clash between those who want A.I. to progress faster and those who want to slow it down.
But it was, most importantly, a fight between two dueling visions of artificial intelligence.
In one vision, A.I. is a transformative new tool, the latest in a line of world-changing innovations that includes the steam engine, electricity and the personal computer, and that, if put to the right uses, could usher in a new era of prosperity and make gobs of money for the businesses that harness its potential.
In another vision, A.I. is something closer to an alien life form -- a leviathan being summoned from the mathematical depths of neural networks -- that must be restrained and deployed with extreme caution in order to prevent it from taking over and killing us all.
With the return of Sam Altman on Tuesday to OpenAI, the company whose board fired him as chief executive last Friday, the battle between these two views appears to be over.
Team Capitalism won. Team Leviathan lost.
OpenAI's new board will consist of three people, at least initially: Adam D'Angelo, the chief executive of Quora (and the only holdover from the old board); Bret Taylor, a former executive at Facebook and Salesforce; and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary. The board is expected to grow from there.
OpenAI's largest investor, Microsoft, is also expected to have a larger voice in OpenAI's governance going forward. That may include a board seat.
Gone from the board are three of the members who pushed for Mr. Altman's ouster: Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist (who has since recanted his decision); Helen Toner, a director of strategy at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology; and Tasha McCauley, an entrepreneur and researcher at the RAND Corporation.
Mr. Sutskever, Ms. Toner and Ms. McCauley are representative of the kinds of people who were heavily involved in thinking about A.I. a decade ago -- an eclectic mix of academics, Silicon Valley futurists and computer scientists. They viewed the technology with a mix of fear and awe, and worried about theoretical future events like the "singularity," a point at which A.I. would outstrip our ability to contain it. Many were affiliated with philosophical groups like the Effective Altruists, a movement that uses data and rationality to make moral decisions, and were persuaded to work in A.I. out of a desire to minimize the technology's destructive effects.
This was the vibe around A.I. in 2015, when OpenAI was formed as a nonprofit, and it helps explain why the organization kept its convoluted governance structure -- which gave the nonprofit board the ability to control the company's operations and replace its leadership -- even after it started a for-profit arm in 2019. At the time, protecting A.I. from the forces of capitalism was viewed by many in the industry as a top priority, one that needed to be enshrined in corporate bylaws and charter documents.
But a lot has changed since 2019. Powerful A.I. is no longer just a thought experiment -- it exists inside real products, like ChatGPT, that are used by millions of people every day. The world's biggest tech companies are racing to build even more powerful systems. And billions of dollars are being spent to build and deploy A.I. inside businesses, with the hope of reducing labor costs and increasing productivity.
The new board members are the kinds of business leaders you'd expect to oversee such a project. Mr. Taylor, the new board chair, is a seasoned Silicon Valley deal maker who led the sale of Twitter to Elon Musk last year, when he was the chair of Twitter's board. And Mr. Summers is the Ur-capitalist -- a prominent economist who has said that he believes technological change is "net good" for society.
There may still be voices of caution on the reconstituted OpenAI board, or figures from the A.I. safety movement. But they won't have veto power, or the ability to effectively shut down the company in an instant, the way the old board did. And their preferences will be balanced alongside others', such as those of the company's executives and investors.
That's a good thing if you're Microsoft, or any of the thousands of other businesses that rely on OpenAI's technology. More traditional governance means less risk of a sudden explosion, or a change that would force you to switch A.I. providers in a hurry.
And perhaps what happened at OpenAI -- a triumph of corporate interests over worries about the future -- was inevitable, given A.I.'s increasing importance. A technology potentially capable of ushering in a Fourth Industrial Revolution was unlikely to be governed over the long term by those who wanted to slow it down -- not when so much money was at stake.
There are still a few traces of the old attitudes in the A.I. industry. Anthropic, a rival company started by a group of former OpenAI employees, has set itself up as a public benefit corporation, a legal structure that is meant to insulate it from market pressures. And an active open-source A.I. movement has advocated that A.I. remain free of corporate control.
But these are best viewed as the last vestiges of the old era of A.I., in which the people building A.I. regarded the technology with both wonder and terror, and sought to restrain its power through organizational governance.
Now, the utopians are in the driver's seat. Full speed ahead.

OpenAI’s new board will consist of three people, at least initially: Adam D’Angelo, the CEO of Quora (and the only holdover from the old board); Bret Taylor, a former executive at Facebook and Salesforce; and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The board is expected to grow from there.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Who is off, and who is on? For now there are three members, including one holdover from the board that ousted Sam Altman as C.E.O. last week.
For much of the past year, OpenAI's board of directors has been criticized as too small and too divided to effectively govern one of the fastest-growing start-ups in Silicon Valley history.
On Friday, the board's dysfunction spilled into public view when four of its members fired Sam Altman, OpenAI's popular and powerful chief executive. The dismissal uncorked five turbulent days, as Mr. Altman rallied almost all of the company's 770 employees to lobby for the board's resignation and his reinstatement.
Mr. Altman, 38, returned to the company on Tuesday night, after days of haggling over his job and over the makeup of the board.
The board and Mr. Altman's allies discussed more than a half dozen options for its future. They considered a board size of three to seven members and discussed about 30 candidates, including Laurene Powell Jobs, the founder of the Emerson Collective and widow of Steve Jobs, and Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb. The departing board wanted to be sure the replacements would be independent thinkers and experienced enough to stand up to Mr. Altman.
On Tuesday evening, both sides agreed to create a provisional, three-person board. It is expected to expand in the coming months, two people close to the negotiations said, but the exact number was unclear. The new group will be responsible for analyzing the structure of OpenAI, the ChatGPT chatbot developer, which started as a nonprofit in 2015 but later added a for-profit subsidiary.
Who is off the board?
Sam Altman: A co-founder of OpenAI, Mr. Altman had been on its board from the start. One of the key sticking points during negotiations with board members was their opposition to his return to his seat. Mr. Altman fought for several days, two people familiar with the negotiations said. On Tuesday, he relented -- at least for now.
Greg Brockman: A co-founder of OpenAI and the board's chairman until last week, Mr. Brockman quit his role as president on Friday in solidarity with Mr. Altman. He expressed interest in returning to the board during negotiations, but its members rejected that possibility, the two people said. Now he is returning to OpenAI as a senior employee with his title yet to be determined. He celebrated his return with colleagues at OpenAI's offices on Tuesday night. On X, formerly Twitter, he posted a selfie with dozens of employees and said, "we are so back."
Ilya Sutskever: A co-founder and top researcher at OpenAI, Mr. Sutskever was born in the Soviet Union and spent years working at the University of Toronto and later at Google with the world's leading A.I. researchers. He spent eight years as OpenAI's well-regarded chief scientist. But last week, he turned on his colleagues and sided with the board's three independent directors to oust Mr. Altman. Mr. Sutskever told Mr. Altman that he was being pushed out and then stood his ground until Sunday, when OpenAI employees threatened to leave en masse and Mr. Brockman's wife, Anna, urged him to reinstate Mr. Altman. After expressing regret publicly for his decision to turn on Mr. Altman, Mr. Sutskever agreed to step off the board on Tuesday.
Helen Toner: An independent board member since 2021, Ms. Toner joined OpenAI at the suggestion of Holden Karnofsky, a board member who stepped down that year because his wife was affiliated with a rival A.I. company, Anthropic. Ms. Toner is a director of strategy at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, a think tank, where she writes about national security issues. She agreed to leave the board.
Tasha McCauley: An independent board member since at least 2018, Ms. McCauley is an adjunct senior management scientist at the RAND Corporation, one of the country's oldest think tanks, and married to the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt. She also serves on the British board of Effective Ventures, a federation of effective altruist organizations. She agreed to leave the board.
Who is on the board?
Adam D'Angelo: An early Facebook executive and a co-founder of the question site Quora, Mr. D'Angelo was one of the board members who ousted Mr. Altman. He was the board's main leader in negotiations and held out for concessions from Mr. Altman during the tense back and forth, two people familiar with the talks said.
Bret Taylor: A fixture of Silicon Valley technical circles and a former Facebook and Salesforce executive, Mr. Taylor was seen during negotiations as a neutral party, three people familiar with the discussions said. He is well regarded among the technorati and is often thought of as a kind of mediator in high-pressure situations. Last year, as a board chairman at Twitter, he was instrumental in negotiating the platform's $ 44 billion sale to Elon Musk.
Lawrence H. Summers: One of the country's most prominent economists, Mr. Summers was a late addition to the list of potential board candidates and critical to ending the impasse over how to proceed because he was believed to be someone who would stand up to Mr. Altman, two of the people familiar with the talks said. Mr. Summers served as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and was president of Harvard. He has been speaking out about the potential for artificial intelligence to displace workers, but his reputation has been damaged over the years. While leading Harvard, he said women might lack an intrinsic aptitude for math and science.
Where is the diversity?
Gender and diversity didn't play a role in deliberations about the board, two of the people said. At various points during negotiations, there were permutations of the board that would have kept Ms. Toner or Ms. McCauley involved.
One of the people involved in the negotiations said that the most important thing was to get a resolution, and that achieving one had some constraints, including that the pool of candidates was largely white and male. The provisional board is expected to become more diverse as it expands in the coming months.

SAN FRANCISCO — One of the strangest episodes in the history of the tech industry ended as startup events often do: with a party in San Francisco’s eclectic Mission District.
Late Tuesday, OpenAI said Sam Altman was returning as its CEO, five days after the artificial intelligence startup’s board of directors forced him out. At the company’s San Francisco office, giddy employees snacked on chicken tenders, drank boba tea and Champagne, and celebrated Altman’s return deep into the night.
Altman’s reinstatement capped a corporate drama that mixed piles of money, a pressure campaign from allies, intense media attention and a steadfast belief among some in the AI community that they should proceed with caution with what they are building.
Now OpenAI, which for two days appeared to be on the brink of collapse just a year after introducing the popular ChatGPT chatbot, will replace a heavily criticized board of directors with a more traditional group including former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and a former executive from the software giant Salesforce.
More board members — who could be plucked from OpenAI’s biggest investor, Microsoft, and the AI research community — are expected to join soon. Altman was not named to the board Tuesday night, and it was not clear if he ever will be.
On Wednesday, what appeared to be emerging from the mess was a company better suited to handle the billions of dollars thrown its way and the attention it has received since it released ChatGPT. But some already argue that it will not be as attuned to OpenAI’s original mission to create AI that is safe for the world.
The OpenAI debacle has illustrated that building AI systems is testing whether businesspeople who want to make money can work in sync with researchers who worry that what they are developing could eventually eliminate jobs or become a threat if technologies like autonomous weapons grow out of control.
The tech industry — perhaps even the world — will be watching to see if OpenAI is any closer to balancing those dueling aspirations than it was a week ago.
“We’ll look back on this period as a very brief, highly dramatic blip that gave us a public and dramatic reset,” said Aaron Levie, the CEO of Box, an online data storage provider. “This needs to be a trustworthy organization that’s aligned with its board, and at the end of it all, OpenAI is a more valuable organization than it was a week ago.”
When Altman, 38, was fired just after noon Friday, OpenAI was pitched into chaos. Its employees and Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in the company, were blindsided.
The AI company has an unusual governance structure. It is controlled by the board of a nonprofit, and its investors have no formal way of influencing decisions. But no one anticipated that four members of the board — including OpenAI’s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder — would suddenly remove Altman, claiming that he could no longer be trusted with the company mission to build AI that “benefits all of humanity.”
The fallout was immediate. OpenAI’s president, Greg Brockman, who also helped found the company eight years ago, quit in protest.
The board had grown increasingly frustrated with Altman’s behavior over the last year and thought it needed to get him under control, according to two people familiar with the board’s thinking. One episode in particular illustrated how fraught the relationship between the board and Altman had become.
Both sides focused on an October research paper co-written by Helen Toner, an OpenAI board member who serves as a director of strategy at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.
Altman complained to Toner that the paper seemed to criticize OpenAI’s efforts to keep its technologies safe while praising a rival. He argued that “any amount of criticism from a board member carries a lot of weight,” he wrote in an email to colleagues.
Toner defended the paper as academic research, but Altman and other OpenAI leaders, including Sutskever, later discussed whether she should be removed from the board, a person involved in the conversations said.
But Sutskever, who is worried that AI could one day destroy humanity, unexpectedly sided with Toner and two other board members: Adam D’Angelo, CEO of the question-and-answer site Quora, and Tasha McCauley, an adjunct senior management scientist at the Rand Corp.
During a video call Friday, Sutskever read Altman a statement that said Altman was being fired because he was not “consistently candid in his communications with the board.”
Over the next five days, Altman and his allies pressed the board to bring him back and for the board to resign. On Sunday, he and company executives negotiated at OpenAI’s offices. In the early afternoon, a delivery driver with a dozen drinks from the Boba Guys chain arrived on a motorbike outside with two bags. Then a second delivery driver appeared.
That night, the talks collapsed, and the board named Emmett Shear, a co-founder of Twitch, as interim CEO.
But Microsoft offered a Plan B: to hire Altman to run a new AI research lab for Microsoft with Brockman. OpenAI’s executives orchestrated a letter from employees saying they’d follow Altman to Microsoft if he wasn’t reinstated. More than 700 of OpenAI’s 770 employees signed, including Sutskever, who said in a post on X that he “deeply regretted” his role in ousting Altman.
The pressure made the other board members dig in their heels, three people familiar with their thinking said. They were appalled that Altman and his allies were encouraging a mutiny and wondered if it could be illegal because the employees had a contractual obligation to the company, not to its CEO. And they thought that as a board, they were acting with integrity and fulfilling their obligation to the nonprofit’s mission.
The board was still determined to force Altman to change his behavior, two people familiar with the board’s deliberations said. It also had concerns about some of his recent efforts to raise funds for personal interests, such as a drug development startup, at the same time that he was raising money for OpenAI.
The talks from Saturday through Tuesday centered on how to create a board that everyone could trust. For the current members, that meant finding directors who would check Altman’s power and push for an independent investigation into his behavior.
While Microsoft supported Altman’s return to OpenAI, the company worked on backup plans, one person familiar with the matter said. Microsoft employees started to prepare offer letters and to line up immigration lawyers for OpenAI staff on work visas, the person said.
OpenAI’s three board members spent most of Tuesday on Google Meet video calls, discussing board options. They spoke with the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, several times, one of these people said.
Altman’s allies offered a board slate of D’Angelo, Summers and Bret Taylor, a seasoned Silicon Valley executive. Taylor, who will be the new board’s chair, oversaw the $44 billion sale of Twitter to Elon Musk when he led Twitter’s board last year.
Taylor and McCauley did not respond to requests for comment. No one involved in discussions has explained how Summers became an option, and he did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
But he has recently established himself as an authority on AI and economics. Summers has warned that ChatGPT will come for the “cognitive class,” changing how doctors make diagnoses, editors work on books and Wall Street traders invest. He has also served on the boards of other technology companies, including the financial services company Block, formerly known as Square.
The board considered Summers to be an independent thinker with enough management experience to hold his ground against Altman, said two of the people familiar with the negotiations.
By Tuesday evening, they had a deal. Thanksgiving helped. Despite all their disagreements, everyone agreed the chaos should not spill into Thursday, one person said.
But there is still plenty of work to be done. Over the next six months, the board will analyze and potentially change OpenAI’s unusual structure, one of these people said.
After the decision to bring back Altman, OpenAI workers filled employee Slack channels with heart emoji and images of a frog, known as “froge,” that has become an unofficial corporate mascot, three employees said.
Late Tuesday, employees gathered at the company’s office to drink boba tea — an inside reference to news coverage over the weekend. Brockman posted a selfie with dozens of smiling workers in the office around midnight.
The caption read: “we are so back.”

If they had been the plot of a science fiction movie, or an episode of “Succession,” the events at OpenAI last weekend would have seemed a little over-the-top.
A secret board coup! Fears of killer AI! A star CEO, betrayed by his chief scientist! A middle-of-the-night staff revolt that threatens to change the balance of global tech power!
If you haven’t been paying attention to all the twists and turns in the saga, that’s OK. It’s been a confusing ride, with lots of complex jargon and hard-to-follow details.
But it’s an important story, even if you’re not particularly interested in AI. If you’ve ever used ChatGPT or drawn a picture with DALL-E 3, or if you care about whether powerful AI systems might someday threaten human survival, all of that is wrapped up in the drama at OpenAI, the country’s most prominent maker of artificial intelligence.
Here’s what you need to know:
Why did this happen?
OpenAI’s board fired its CEO, Sam Altman, in a surprise move on Friday. The board’s explanation — that Altman had not been completely candid with them — was vague and opaque.
We still don’t know exactly what happened between Altman and the board. But OpenAI’s unusual governance structure — it is run by a nonprofit board that controls a for-profit subsidiary and can vote to replace its leaders — allowed the board to fire Altman without explaining itself.
What was the coup about?
The coup was led by Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s chief scientist, who had butted heads with Altman. Sutskever wants the company to prioritize safety and was worried that Altman was more focused on growth.
Sutskever is among a faction of AI experts who are fearful that AI may soon surpass human abilities and become a threat to our survival. Several of OpenAI’s board members have ties to effective altruism, a philosophical movement that has made preventing these threats a top priority. Altman has concerns about AI risks, too. But he has also expressed optimism that AI will be good for society, and a desire to make progress more quickly. That may have put him at odds with the safety-minded board members, whose job is to see that powerful AI is developed responsibly.
What’s happened since the coup?
Over the weekend, it looked as if Altman might return to OpenAI, under the condition that major changes were made to the board. That didn’t happen. Instead, late Sunday, the board affirmed its decision, writing to employees that Altman’s “behavior and lack of transparency in his interactions with the board undermined the board’s ability to effectively supervise the company in the manner it was mandated to do.”
The board then appointed Emmett Shear — the former CEO of Twitch, a livestreaming company — to be OpenAI’s second interim CEO in just a few days. (Mira Murati, the chief technology officer, had the job, but lost it after signaling her support for Altman.)
In response, Microsoft — OpenAI’s biggest investor and a major strategic partner — offered to give Altman and his top lieutenant, Greg Brockman, a job running a new AI lab. Nearly all of OpenAI’s roughly 770 employees signed a letter threatening to quit and go work for the new Microsoft team, unless the startup’s board resigned and brought back Altman and Brockman.
In another surprise twist, Sutskever then had second thoughts. He wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday that he deeply regretted having taken part in the ouster and that he had “never intended to harm OpenAI.” He also signed the letter pledging to follow Altman and Brockman to Microsoft unless the board reversed its decision.
Why does this matter to the rest of us?
Corporate infighting is not new. But what makes the OpenAI story stand out is the stakes. OpenAI is no ordinary company. It built ChatGPT, one of the fastest-growing tech products of all time, and it employs many of the top AI researchers.
The company is also unusually ambitious and saw its role as building a digital superintelligence that would eventually become more powerful than humans. In addition, Altman was a well-liked leader and a figurehead for the industry, making the board’s move more of a mystery.
What’s happening at OpenAI is a proxy for one of the biggest fights in the global economy today: how to control powerful AI tools, and whether companies can be trusted to develop them responsibly.

Climate Study Shows Restoration of Forests Isn't Enough by Itself: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The research, which comes with important caveats, was partly an effort to address the scientific uproar surrounding an earlier paper.
Restoring global forests where they occur naturally could potentially capture an additional 226 gigatons of planet-warming carbon, equivalent to about a third of the amount that humans have released since the beginning of the Industrial Era, according to a new study published on Monday in the journal Nature.
The research, with input from more than 200 authors, leveraged vast troves of data collected by satellites and on the ground and was partly an effort to address the controversy surrounding an earlier paper. That study, in 2019, helped to spur the Trillion Trees movement but also caused a scientific uproar.
The new conclusions were similar to those in a separate study published last year. Mainly, the extra storage capacity would come from allowing existing forests to recover to maturity.
But major caveats remain: If we protect all current forests, where will people get timber, rubber and palm oil? Would forests be able to store carbon quickly enough? And how much forest carbon would be lost to fire, drought and pests as climate change intensifies?
The 226 gigatons of storage cannot be achieved without cutting greenhouse gas emissions, said Thomas Crowther, the study's senior author and a professor of ecology at ETH Zurich, a university in Switzerland. "If we continue emitting carbon, as we've done to date, then droughts and fires and other extreme events will continue to threaten the scale of the global forest system, further limiting its potential to contribute."
Forests are essential to tackling both the climate and biodiversity crises. They offer food, shelter and shade to humans and countless other species. They clean our air and water. And they pull climate-warming carbon out of the atmosphere. As the climate crisis intensifies, that ability has made them controversial: How much can we rely on trees to get us out of this mess?
Dr. Crowther was the senior author of a polarizing study on forest carbon in 2019 that drew scientific backlash but also inspired an effort by the World Economic Forum to grow and conserve one trillion trees.
In 2019, he acknowledged, careless language led to trees being wrongly painted as a silver bullet for climate change. Now, his biggest fear is that countries and companies will keep treating forests that way, using them for carbon offsets to enable the continued use of fossil fuels.
"We are all terrified that this potential of nature gets misused," Dr. Crowther said. "Nature has such spectacular potential to help us tackle global threats, but it will be devastating if major organizations use nature as an excuse to do more harm to our planet."
The World Economic Forum's tree program, 1t.org, was started with funding from Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, and endorsed by figures from then-President Donald Trump to Jane Goodall. Dr. Crowther himself, a charismatic and media-savvy scientist, is an adviser to the group.
His new study's number of 226 gigatons of carbon approximates his previous one of 205, but it gets there very differently. Both papers exclude urban areas, croplands and pastures but include rangelands, where animals may graze at lower densities. In the new research, 61 percent of the additional carbon storage would come from protecting existing forests and the other 39 percent from growing trees in deforested areas with low human footprints.
In the 2019 study, all the carbon came from growing trees where they could occur naturally outside of existing forests. More than 50 scientists published seven critiques in Science that year, disputing both the analysis and its implications. One accusation was that the study endorsed inappropriate tree planting on grasslands and other nonforested ecosystems, destroying native biodiversity. Another was that the estimates of carbon storage were far too high for the amount of land concerned.
Simon Lewis, a professor of global change science at University College London, submitted one such critique in 2019. But the new study, he said, was "reasonable."
Still, he emphasized that carbon drawdown from forests should be kept in perspective. "There is still only a finite amount of land to dedicate to forests," he said, "so only a small fraction of the potential carbon uptake has a chance of being realized."
Another critic from 2019, Joseph Veldman, a professor of ecology and conservation biology at Texas A&M University, praised the enormous amount of data the study brought to bear but said its findings still relied on inappropriate densities of trees in landscapes where they exist naturally but should remain sparse, like savannas and deserts.
Despite global pledges, leaders have struggled to rein in deforestation. Last year, the world lost 10 percent more primary tropical rainforest than in 2021, though Brazil's current government has made recent progress.
Restoration efforts have also proven problematic. In the name of fighting climate change, countries and companies have often invested in failed mass tree plantings or monocultures of commercial, nonnative species that hurt biodiversity. While the latter might grow quickly, they sequester only half as much carbon over time, Dr. Crowther said.
He emphasized that restoration should be driven by local communities that choose to work in concert with nature to help themselves. A nonprofit he founded, Restor, connects community projects, like an agroforestry farm in Ethiopia, with potential supporters.
"Instead of removing the forests to grow coffee, they instead keep the forests standing," Dr. Crowther said. "And because the forest captures water and nutrients, those trees grow really well without the need for fertilizers or irrigation, and as a result, nature makes their farm more productive."
It's unclear how much such efforts can scale up. Matthew Fagan, a professor of geography and environmental systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who works on global forest monitoring, said he believed the new estimate was too high because it did not account for people and fire.
"The fact that it aligns with other rough estimates of global carbon owes more to the unfortunate reality that they share methods and data sources in common than to the truth," he said.
He and other scientists also raised concerns about the warming effects that trees can have in colder and drier climates as they absorb heat that would otherwise have been reflected by snow or grass.
But there is one thing they all agree on: To tackle both climate change and biodiversity loss, the world must do far more to cut fossil fuels and end deforestation of old-growth forests.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Restoring global forests where they occur naturally could potentially capture an additional 226 gigatons of planet-warming carbon, equivalent to about one-third of the amount that humans have released since the beginning of the Industrial Era, according to a new study published Monday in the journal Nature.
The research, with input from more than 200 authors, leveraged vast troves of data collected by satellites and on the ground and was partly an effort to address the controversy surrounding an earlier paper. That study, in 2019, helped to spur the Trillion Trees movement but also caused a scientific uproar.
The new conclusions were similar to those in a separate study published last year. Mainly, the extra storage capacity would come from allowing existing forests to recover to maturity.
But major caveats remain: If we protect all current forests, where will people get timber, rubber and palm oil? Would forests be able to store carbon quickly enough? And how much forest carbon would be lost to fire, drought and pests as climate change intensifies?
The 226 gigatons of storage cannot be achieved without cutting greenhouse gas emissions, said Thomas Crowther, the study’s senior author and a professor of ecology at ETH Zurich, a university in Switzerland. “If we continue emitting carbon, as we’ve done to date, then droughts and fires and other extreme events will continue to threaten the scale of the global forest system, further limiting its potential to contribute.”
Forests are essential to tackling both the climate and biodiversity crises. They offer food, shelter and shade to humans and countless other species. They clean our air and water. And they pull climate-warming carbon out of the atmosphere. As the climate crisis intensifies, that ability has made them controversial: How much can we rely on trees to get us out of this mess?
Crowther was the senior author of a polarizing study on forest carbon in 2019 that drew scientific backlash but also inspired an effort by the World Economic Forum to grow and conserve 1 trillion trees.
In 2019, he acknowledged, careless language led to trees being wrongly painted as a silver bullet for climate change. Now, his biggest fear is that countries and companies will keep treating forests that way, using them for carbon offsets to enable the continued use of fossil fuels.
“We are all terrified that this potential of nature gets misused,” Crowther said. “Nature has such spectacular potential to help us tackle global threats, but it will be devastating if major organizations use nature as an excuse to do more harm to our planet.”
The World Economic Forum’s tree program, 1t.org, was started with funding from Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, and endorsed by figures from then-President Donald Trump to Jane Goodall. Crowther himself, a charismatic and media-savvy scientist, is an adviser to the group.
His new study’s number of 226 gigatons of carbon approximates his previous one of 205, but it gets there very differently. Both papers exclude urban areas, croplands and pastures but include rangelands, where animals may graze at lower densities. In the new research, 61% of the additional carbon storage would come from protecting existing forests and the other 39% from growing trees in deforested areas with low human footprints.
In the 2019 study, all the carbon came from growing trees where they could occur naturally outside of existing forests. More than 50 scientists published seven critiques in Science that year, disputing both the analysis and its implications. One accusation was that the study endorsed inappropriate tree planting on grasslands and other nonforested ecosystems, destroying native biodiversity. Another was that the estimates of carbon storage were far too high for the amount of land concerned.
Simon Lewis, a professor of global change science at University College London, submitted one such critique in 2019. But the new study, he said, was “reasonable.”
Still, he emphasized that carbon drawdown from forests should be kept in perspective. “There is still only a finite amount of land to dedicate to forests,” he said, “so only a small fraction of the potential carbon uptake has a chance of being realized.”
Another critic from 2019, Joseph Veldman, a professor of ecology and conservation biology at Texas A&M University, praised the enormous amount of data the study brought to bear but said its findings still relied on inappropriate densities of trees in landscapes where they exist naturally but should remain sparse, such as savannas and deserts.
Despite global pledges, leaders have struggled to rein in deforestation. Last year, the world lost 10% more primary tropical rainforest than in 2021, though Brazil’s current government has made recent progress.
Restoration efforts have also proven problematic. In the name of fighting climate change, countries and companies have often invested in failed mass tree plantings or monocultures of commercial, nonnative species that hurt biodiversity. While the latter might grow quickly, they sequester only half as much carbon over time, Crowther said.
He emphasized that restoration should be driven by local communities that choose to work in concert with nature to help themselves. A nonprofit he founded, Restor, connects community projects, such as an agroforestry farm in Ethiopia, with potential supporters.
“Instead of removing the forests to grow coffee, they instead keep the forests standing,” Crowther said. “And because the forest captures water and nutrients, those trees grow really well without the need for fertilizers or irrigation, and as a result, nature makes their farm more productive.”
It’s unclear how much such efforts can scale up. Matthew Fagan, a professor of geography and environmental systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who works on global forest monitoring, said he believed the new estimate was too high because it did not account for people and fire.
“The fact that it aligns with other rough estimates of global carbon owes more to the unfortunate reality that they share methods and data sources in common than to the truth,” he said.
He and other scientists also raised concerns about the warming effects that trees can have in colder and drier climates as they absorb heat that would otherwise have been reflected by snow or grass.
But there is one thing they all agree on: To tackle both climate change and biodiversity loss, the world must do far more to cut fossil fuels and end deforestation of old-growth forests.

San Francisco Shows It Can Clean Up Well, For the World's Leaders: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference comes at a pivotal moment for the city as it struggles to rebound from the pandemic.
San Francisco had the air this week of teenagers frantically cleaning up after a house party with their parents on the way home.
On Market Street, the city's main thoroughfare, maintenance workers resurfaced uneven sidewalks and installed plywood over empty tree wells.
Nearby, a crew gave a long-derelict plaza a makeover by turning it into a skateboard park and outdoor cafe with pingpong tables, chess boards and scores of potted plants. Elsewhere, workers painted decorative crosswalks and new murals, wiped away graffiti, picked up piles of trash and removed scaffolding to show off a refurbished clock tower at the Ferry Building.
Not since the United Nations Charter was signed here in 1945 has San Francisco hosted as large a gathering of world leaders as the one convening over the next week. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, beginning on Saturday, is expected to draw 21 world leaders from Pacific Rim countries -- including President Biden and President Xi Jinping of China. As many as 30,000 people are expected to attend.
The conference comes at a pivotal moment for San Francisco, which has struggled to rebound from the pandemic closures that scrambled downtowns across the country. The exodus of tech commuters hammered the city harder than most, leaving retailers bereft of customers, while scenes of homelessness, drug use and petty crime became more visible.
Local leaders hope the APEC conference will be just the catalyst that San Francisco needs to shake off its pandemic doldrums. At the very least, the past few weeks have shown that the city can clean up well.
"This is a huge opportunity, and we've been planning this down to the gnat's eyebrow," said Aaron Peskin, the president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
Mr. Peskin turned to history for hope that the APEC conference could reverse the city's beleaguered image, one that many residents say has been unfairly overblown. He said the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, a World's Fair along the northern waterfront, signaled the city's recovery from the destructive 1906 earthquake and fire. It drew more than 18 million people and featured a transcontinental telephone call to New York.
More than a century later, the city has become the locus of artificial intelligence development, but it has a long way to go to restore its boomtown image. Its latest makeover has relied on beautification efforts and overdue maintenance, along with heavier police enforcement in downtown neighborhoods.
Brooke Jenkins, who was appointed as district attorney last year after voters ousted her predecessor over frustrations with crime, said that law enforcement had more authority during the conference to clear people out of designated zones. Those areas include a swath surrounding Moscone Center, where the meetings will take place, and around the Fairmont Hotel atop Nob Hill, where President Biden will stay.
Perhaps the most obvious change has been seen at the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Federal Building at the corner of Seventh and Mission Streets, less than a mile from the conference center.
For two years, a stubborn fentanyl market at the corner and a sprawling homeless encampment across the street became neighborhood fixtures. People regularly used drugs in an adjacent alley.
Most have seemingly disappeared in a poof.
"Come on! Pack it up," a security guard repeatedly told a few stragglers on Monday who were hunched over scraps of foil, which have become common drug paraphernalia.
Kirsten Thomas, 30, sat at the corner in a wheelchair stroking her dog, Billy. She has been living on the streets since leaving Utah with her boyfriend and described themselves as "travelers" exploring the West Coast.
She said that guards and police officers had told her to move along more often than usual during the day, but that she had a bed at a nearby homeless shelter at night. The city is adding more than 300 beds to its shelter system this month, and is expected to keep them in place once the conference ends.
"The president is coming. They want nicer looking streets," Ms. Thomas said with a shrug.
Some residents have wondered why San Francisco has been able to fix its notorious problems for the president, but not for them.
A few blocks south of where Ms. Thomas sat, Adam Mesnick, owner of the Deli Board sandwich shop, ordered extra corned beef, pastrami and bacon because he feared delivery trucks wouldn't be able to reach him during the traffic snarls expected during the conference.
Mr. Mesnick has been a longtime critic of City Hall for not solving San Francisco's drug and homelessness problems.
"If the city is able to create an illusion that it's clean and runs effectively and humans are in shelters, even if it's just for APEC, why is that not sustainable for the longer term?" he asked.
Since the start of 2020, more than 2,600 people have died of drug overdoses in San Francisco, most involving fentanyl -- more than from Covid, homicides and car crashes combined -- according to the city's chief medical examiner. Four months ago, Ms. Jenkins's prosecutors began working with state and federal agencies on a new initiative called "All Hands on Deck" to arrest fentanyl dealers and clear open-air drug markets.
In that time, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California over the past four months has accelerated federal cases against 30 drug-related defendants, resulting in sentences handed down in less than a month, on average, after arrest, officials announced last week. Ms. Jenkins said she had been assured that the state and federal help would continue after APEC was over.
"We can't leave San Franciscans feeling as though things get cleaned up for other people and not for them," she said.
Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, worried that the city was focusing only on convenience. She said that police officers and outreach workers had prioritized shelter beds for homeless people in the conference zone rather than for the sickest, most destitute or those who had waited for beds the longest.
"It's a very surface-level cleanup where they're just trying to hide the presence of homeless people rather than addressing the issue," she said.
APEC is expected to give a $ 52.8 million jolt to the struggling local economy, and visitors have booked a combined 55,000 hotel nights, according to the city and the San Francisco Travel Association. The conference could also bring chaos. Thousands of protesters are expected to gather, and traffic will surely be jammed.
At Mayor London Breed's City Hall office -- where her desk has a gold plaque reading, "What Would Beyoncé Do?" -- she said in an interview that she felt San Francisco had been unfairly maligned by media reports and social media posts. Despite voter dissatisfaction in polls, she said life in the city had been "looking up."
This week, San Francisco was awarded the N.B.A. All-Star Game in 2025, and Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, announced that the Dreamforce conference hosted by the company would return next year, despite threatening earlier to move the annual tech extravaganza elsewhere.
"This is what we do well as a city," Ms. Breed said of big events. "We really rise to the occasion to meet the need of the time in such an extraordinary way."
A Ferris wheel has been moved from Golden Gate Park to the Fisherman's Wharf tourist hub along the bay, and the art nonprofit Illuminate will shine pastel-colored lasers for miles down Market Street throughout the conference. Parties will abound, including "GAYPEC," which will be hosted by the mayor and gay political leaders and feature drag queens.
In late September, an international delegation scouted the city to gain insights for their country's leaders before the conference and chatted with Ms. Breed at "Dear San Francisco," a show that included acrobats, dancing and original music. She added that the delegation told her the city's street problems weren't as bad as they had feared.
She's just hoping they take that message home with them next week.

Presenting a Future Without a Screen. Maybe.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Inside a former horse stable in the San Francisco neighborhood of SoMa, a wave of gentle chirps emerged from small, blinking devices pinned to the chests of employees at a start-up called Humane.
It was just weeks before the start-up's gadget, the Ai Pin, would be revealed to the world -- a culmination of five years, $ 240 million in funding, 25 patents, a steady drumbeat of hype and partnerships with a list of top tech companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft and Salesforce.
Their mission? No less than liberating the world from its smartphone addiction. The solution? More technology.
Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, Humane's husband-and-wife founders, envision a future with less dependency on the screens that their former employer, Apple, made ubiquitous.
Artificial intelligence "can create an experience that allows the computer to essentially take a back seat," Mr. Chaudhri said.
They're billing the pin as the first artificially intelligent device. It can be controlled by speaking aloud, tapping a touch pad or projecting a laser display onto the palm of a hand. In an instant, the device's virtual assistant can send a text message, play a song, snap a photo, make a call or translate a real-time conversation into another language. The system relies on A.I. to help answer questions ("What's the best way to load the dishwasher?") and can summarize incoming messages with the simple command: "Catch me up."
The technology is a step forward from Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. It can follow a conversation from one question to the next, without needing explicit context. It's also capable of editing a single word in a dictated message, rather than requiring the user to correct an error by repeating the text from beginning to end, as other systems do. And it does it from a gadget that's reminiscent of the badges worn in Star Trek.
To tech insiders, it's a moonshot. To outsiders, it's a sci-fi fantasy.
At Humane, there's deep anxiety about the weeks ahead. The tech industry has a large graveyard of wearable products that have failed to catch on. Humane will begin shipping the pins next year. It expects to sell around 100,000 pins, which will cost $ 699 and require a $ 24 monthly subscription, in the first year. (Apple sold 381,000 iPods in the year after its 2001 launch.)
For the start-up to succeed, people will need to learn a new operating system, called Cosmos, and be open to getting new phone numbers for the device. (The pin comes with its own wireless plan.) They'll need to dictate rather than type texts and trade a camera that zooms for wide-angle photos. They'll need to be patient because certain features, like object recognition and videos, won't be available initially. And the pin can sometimes be buggy, as it was during some of the company's demos for The New York Times.
Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, said in an interview that he expected A.I. to be "a huge part" of how we interact with computers. He has invested in Humane as well as another A.I. company, Rewind AI, that plans to make a necklace that will record what people say and hear. He's also discussed teaming up with Jony Ive, Apple's former chief designer, to create an A.I. gadget with a similar ambition to Humane.
Humane has the advantage of being the first of those A.I.-focused devices to become available, but Mr. Altman said in an interview that was no guarantee of success. "That will be up to customers to decide," he said. "Maybe it's a bridge too far," he said, "or maybe people are like, 'This is much better than my phone."' Plenty of technology that looked like a sure bet ends up selling for 90 percent off at Best Buy, he added.
iPhone Guilt
Ms. Bongiorno, 40, and Mr. Chaudhri, 50, have a marriage of contrasts. He shaves his head bald and speaks with the soft, calm voice of a yogi. She sweeps her long blond hair over one shoulder and has the enthusiasm of a team captain. They both dress in Jobsian black.
They met at Apple in 2008. Mr. Chaudhri was working on its human interface, defining the swipes and drags that control iPhones. Ms. Bongiorno was a program manager for the iPhone and iPad. They worked together until they left Apple in late 2016.
A Buddhist monk named Brother Spirit led them to Humane. Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno had developed concepts for two A.I. products: a women's health device and the pin. Brother Spirit, whom they met through their acupuncturist, recommended that they share the ideas with his friend, Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce.
Sitting beneath a palm tree on a cliff above the ocean at Mr. Benioff's Hawaiian home in 2018, they explained both devices. "This one," Mr. Benioff said, pointing at the Ai Pin, as dolphins breached the surf below, "is huge."
"It's going to be a massive company," he added.
Humane's goal was to replicate the usefulness of the iPhone without any of the components that make us all addicted -- the dopamine hit of dragging to refresh a Facebook feed or swiping to see a new TikTok video. They experimented in secret with hardware components and built a virtual assistant, like Siri or Alexa, working with customized language models based, in part, on OpenAI's offerings.
The device's most sci-fi element -- the laser that projects a text menu onto a hand -- started inside a box the size of a matchbook. It took three years to miniaturize it to be smaller than the size of a golf tee.
Humane established a company culture that borrowed from Apple, including its secretiveness. During its experimentation phase, the start-up created intrigue by announcing high profile investors like Mr. Altman and making grandiose -- if vague -- public statements about building "the next shift between humans and computing." Humane also retained Apple's obsession with design details, from its device's curved corners and compostable white packaging to the Japanese-style toilets at the company's stark office.
But Humane departed from Apple's rigid and demanding culture in certain ways. The company encouraged staff to work together, question plans and speak up.
José Benitez Cong, a longtime Apple executive who considered himself retired, joined Humane, in part, for redemption. Mr. Benitez Cong said he was "disgusted" by what the iPhone had done to society, noting his son could mimic a swiping motion at the age of 1. "This could be something that could help me get over my guilt of working on the iPhone," Mr. Benitez Cong said.
Holding the Light
A haunting whoosh filled the room, and two dozen Humane employees, seated around a long white table, carefully concentrated on the sound. It was just before the Ai Pin's release, and they were evaluating its rings and beeps. The pin's "personic" speaker (a company portmanteau of "personal" and "sonic") is critical, since many of its features rely on verbal and audio cues.
Mr. Chaudhri praised the "assuredness" of one chirp noise and Ms. Bongiorno complimented the "more physical" sounds for the pin's laser. "It feels like you're actually holding the light," she marveled.
Less assuring: That whoosh, which plays when sending a text message. "It feels ominous," Ms. Bongiorno said. Others around the table said it sounded like a ghost, or as if you made a mistake, almost. Someone thought it was a Halloween joke.
Ms. Bongiorno wanted the sound for sending a text to feel as satisfying as the trash-can sound on one of Apple's older operating systems. "Like 'thunk,"' she said.
The device is arriving at a time when excitement and skepticism for A.I. hit new highs each week. Industry researchers are warning of the technology's existential risk and regulators are eager to crack down on it.
Yet investors are eagerly pouring cash into A.I. start-ups. Before Humane even released a product, its backers had valued it at $ 850 million.
The company has tried to promote a message of trust and transparency, despite spending most of its existence working in secret. Humane's Ai Pins have what the company calls a "trust light" that blinks when the device is recording. (A user must tap the pin to "wake" it.) Humane said it did not sell user data to third parties or use it in training its A.I. models.
In the months leading up to its introduction, Humane has fanned the anticipation. In April, Mr. Chaudhri showed off the pin's laser projector during a TED Talk. (People later accused him of faking the demo, he said, but he assured that it was real.) In September, in an echo of Apple's fashion-friendly launch of its Watch, the supermodel Naomi Campbell wore Humane's pin -- barely noticeable without knowing to look for it -- on a gray Coperni blazer on the runway at Paris Fashion Week.
A.I. App Store
Humane's supporters have a pat way of dismissing skepticism about its prospects -- they invoke the first iPod. That clunky, awkward device had just one use, playing songs, but it laid the groundwork for the real revolution, smartphones. Similarly, Humane envisions an entire ecosystem of companies building features for its operating system -- an A.I. version of Apple's App Store.
But first, raisins. In a demo at Humane's office of a feature that will be rolled out in a future version of the product, a software designer picked up a chocolate chip cookie and tapped the pin on his left breast. As it whirred to life with a beep, he asked, "How much sugar is in this?"
"I'm sorry; couldn't look up the amount of sugar in oatmeal raisin cookie," the virtual assistant said.
Mr. Chaudhri shrugged off the mistake. "To be fair, I have trouble with the difference between a chocolate chip cookie and an oatmeal raisin."
Humane's ambition to disrupt the smartphone is audacious, creative and even irrational; the kind of thing Silicon Valley is supposed to be known for, but, which critics bemoan, in recent years has turned into incremental frivolities, like selfie apps and robot pizza trucks.
But even after months of wearing their Ai Pins all day, Humane's founders can't fully detach from their screens. "Are we using our smartphones less?" Mr. Chaudhri asked. "We're using them differently."

SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco had the air last week of teenagers frantically cleaning up after a house party with their parents on the way home.
On Market Street, the city’s main thoroughfare, maintenance workers resurfaced uneven sidewalks and installed plywood over empty tree wells.
Nearby, a crew gave a long-derelict plaza a makeover by turning it into a skateboard park and outdoor cafe with pingpong tables, chess boards and scores of potted plants. Elsewhere, workers painted decorative crosswalks and new murals, wiped away graffiti, picked up piles of trash and removed scaffolding to show off a refurbished clock tower at the Ferry Building.
Not since the United Nations Charter was signed here in 1945 has San Francisco hosted as large a gathering of world leaders as the one convening this week. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, which began Saturday, is expected to draw 21 world leaders from Pacific Rim countries, including President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping of China. As many as 30,000 people are expected to attend.
The conference comes at a pivotal moment for San Francisco, which has struggled to rebound from the pandemic closures that scrambled downtowns across the country. The exodus of tech commuters hammered the city harder than most, leaving retailers bereft of customers, while scenes of homelessness, drug use and petty crime became more visible.
Local leaders hope the APEC conference will be just the catalyst that San Francisco needs to shake off its pandemic doldrums. At the very least, the past few weeks have shown that the city can clean up well.
“This is a huge opportunity, and we’ve been planning this down to the gnat’s eyebrow,” said Aaron Peskin, president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.
Peskin turned to history for hope that the APEC conference could reverse the city’s beleaguered image, one that many residents say has been unfairly overblown. He said the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, a World’s Fair along the northern waterfront, signaled the city’s recovery from the destructive 1906 earthquake and fire. It drew more than 18 million people and featured a transcontinental telephone call to New York.
More than a century later, the city has become the locus of artificial intelligence development, but it has a long way to go to restore its boomtown image. Its latest makeover has relied on beautification efforts and overdue maintenance, along with heavier police enforcement in downtown neighborhoods.
Brooke Jenkins, who was appointed as district attorney last year after voters ousted her predecessor over frustrations with crime, said law enforcement had more authority during the conference to clear people out of designated zones. Those areas include a swath surrounding Moscone Center, where the meetings will take place, and around the Fairmont Hotel atop Nob Hill, where Biden will stay.
Perhaps the most obvious change has been seen at the Speaker Nancy Pelosi Federal Building, at the corner of Seventh and Mission streets, less than a mile from the conference center.
For two years, a stubborn fentanyl market at the corner and a sprawling homeless encampment across the street became neighborhood fixtures. People regularly used drugs in an adjacent alley.
Most have seemingly disappeared in a poof.
“Come on! Pack it up,” a security guard repeatedly told a few stragglers Monday who were hunched over scraps of foil, which have become common drug paraphernalia.
Kirsten Thomas, 30, sat at the corner in a wheelchair stroking her dog, Billy. She has been living on the streets since leaving Utah with her boyfriend and described themselves as “travelers” exploring the West Coast.
She said that guards and police officers had told her to move along more often than usual during the day, but that she had a bed at a nearby homeless shelter at night. The city is adding more than 300 beds to its shelter system this month and is expected to keep them in place once the conference ends.
“The president is coming. They want nicer looking streets,” Thomas said with a shrug.
Some residents have wondered why San Francisco has been able to fix its notorious problems for the president, but not for them.
A few blocks south of where Thomas sat, Adam Mesnick, owner of the Deli Board sandwich shop, ordered extra corned beef, pastrami and bacon because he feared delivery trucks wouldn’t be able to reach him during the traffic snarls expected during the conference.
Mesnick has been a longtime critic of City Hall for not solving San Francisco’s drug and homelessness problems.
“If the city is able to create an illusion that it’s clean and runs effectively and humans are in shelters, even if it’s just for APEC, why is that not sustainable for the longer term?” he asked.
Since the start of 2020, more than 2,600 people have died of drug overdoses in San Francisco, most involving fentanyl — more than from COVID-19, homicides and car crashes combined — according to the city’s chief medical examiner. Four months ago, Jenkins’ prosecutors began working with state and federal agencies on a new initiative called “All Hands on Deck” to arrest fentanyl dealers and clear open-air drug markets.
In that time, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California has accelerated federal cases against 30 drug-related defendants, resulting in sentences handed down in less than a month, on average, after arrest, officials announced this month. Jenkins said she had been assured that the state and federal help would continue after APEC was over.
“We can’t leave San Franciscans feeling as though things get cleaned up for other people and not for them,” she said.
Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, worried that the city was focusing only on convenience. She said police officers and outreach workers had prioritized shelter beds for homeless people in the conference zone rather than for the sickest, most destitute or those who had waited for beds the longest.
“It’s a very surface-level cleanup where they’re just trying to hide the presence of homeless people rather than addressing the issue,” she said.
APEC is expected to give a $52.8 million jolt to the struggling local economy, and visitors have booked a combined 55,000 hotel nights, according to the city and the San Francisco Travel Association. The conference could also bring chaos. Thousands of protesters are expected to gather, and traffic will surely be jammed.
At Mayor London Breed’s City Hall office — where her desk has a gold plaque reading, “What Would Beyoncé Do?” — she said in an interview that she felt San Francisco had been unfairly maligned by media reports and social media posts. Despite voter dissatisfaction in polls, she said life in the city had been “looking up.”
Last week, San Francisco was awarded the NBA All-Star Game in 2025, and Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, announced that the Dreamforce conference hosted by the company would return next year, despite threatening earlier to move the annual tech extravaganza elsewhere.
“This is what we do well as a city,” Breed said of big events. “We really rise to the occasion to meet the need of the time in such an extraordinary way.”
A Ferris wheel has been moved from Golden Gate Park to the Fisherman’s Wharf tourist hub along the bay, and the art nonprofit Illuminate will shine pastel-colored lasers for miles down Market Street throughout the conference. Parties will abound, including “GAYPEC,” which will be hosted by the mayor and gay political leaders and feature drag queens.
In late September, an international delegation scouted the city to gain insights for their countries’ leaders before the conference and chatted with Breed at “Dear San Francisco,” a show that included acrobats, dancing and original music. She added that the delegation told her the city’s street problems weren’t as bad as they had feared.
She’s just hoping they take that message home with them this week.

A.I.-Powered Chatbots May 'Hallucinate' More Often Than Many Realized: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When the San Francisco start-up OpenAI unveiled its ChatGPT online chatbot late last year, millions were wowed by the humanlike way it answered questions, wrote poetry and discussed almost any topic. But most people were slow to realize that this new kind of chatbot often makes things up.
When Google introduced a similar chatbot several weeks later, it spewed nonsense about the James Webb telescope. The next day, Microsoft's new Bing chatbot offered up all sorts of bogus information about the Gap, Mexican nightlife and the singer Billie Eilish. Then, in March, ChatGPT cited a half dozen fake court cases while writing a 10-page legal brief that a lawyer submitted to a federal judge in Manhattan.
Now a new start-up called Vectara, founded by former Google employees, is trying to figure out how often chatbots veer from the truth. The company's research estimates that even in situations designed to prevent it from happening, chatbots invent information at least 3 percent of the time -- and as high as 27 percent.
Experts call this chatbot behavior "hallucination." It may not be a problem for people tinkering with chatbots on their personal computers, but it is a serious issue for anyone using this technology with court documents, medical information or sensitive business data.
Because these chatbots can respond to almost any request in an unlimited number of ways, there is no way of definitively determining how often they hallucinate. "You would have to look at all of the world's information," said Simon Hughes, the Vectara researcher who led the project.
Dr. Hughes and his team asked these systems to perform a single, straightforward task that is readily verified: Summarize news articles. Even then, the chatbots persistently invented information.
"We gave the system 10 to 20 facts and asked for a summary of those facts," said Amr Awadallah, the chief executive of Vectara and a former Google executive. "That the system can still introduce errors is a fundamental problem."
The researchers argue that when these chatbots perform other tasks -- beyond mere summarization -- hallucination rates may be higher.
Their research also showed that hallucination rates vary widely among the leading A.I. companies. OpenAI's technologies had the lowest rate, around 3 percent. Systems from Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, hovered around 5 percent. The Claude 2 system offered by Anthropic, an OpenAI rival also based in San Francisco, topped 8 percent. A Google system, Palm chat, had the highest rate at 27 percent.
An Anthropic spokeswoman, Sally Aldous, said, "Making our systems helpful, honest and harmless, which includes avoiding hallucinations, is one of our core goals as a company."
Google declined to comment, and OpenAI and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
With this research, Dr. Hughes and Mr. Awadallah want to show people that they must be wary of information that comes from chatbots and even the service that Vectara sells to businesses. Many companies are now offering this kind of technology for business use.
Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Vectara is a 30-person start-up backed by $ 28.5 million in seed funding. One of its founders, Amin Ahmad, a former Google artificial intelligence researcher, has been working with this kind of technology since 2017, when it was incubated inside Google and a handful of other companies.
Much as Microsoft's Bing search chatbot can retrieve information from the open internet, Vectara's service can retrieve information from a company's private collection of emails, documents and other files.
The researchers also hope that their methods -- which they are sharing publicly and will continue to update -- will help spur efforts across the industry to reduce hallucinations. OpenAI, Google and others are working to minimize the issue through a variety of techniques, though it is not clear whether they can eliminate the problem.
"A good analogy is a self-driving car," said Philippe Laban, a researcher at Salesforce who has long explored this kind of technology. "You cannot keep a self-driving car from crashing. But you can try to make sure it is safer than a human driver."
Chatbots like ChatGPT are driven by a technology called a large language model, or L.L.M., which learns its skills by analyzing enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles and online chat logs. By pinpointing patterns in all that data, an L.L.M. learns to do one thing in particular: guess the next word in a sequence of words.
Because the internet is filled with untruthful information, these systems repeat the same untruths. They also rely on probabilities: What is the mathematical chance that the next word is "playwright"? From time to time, they guess incorrectly.
The new research from Vectara shows how this can happen. In summarizing news articles, chatbots do not repeat untruths from other parts of the internet. They just get the summarization wrong.
For example, the researchers asked Google's large language model, Palm chat, to summarize this short passage from a news article:
The plants were found during the search of a warehouse near Ashbourne on Saturday morning. Police said they were in "an elaborate grow house." A man in his late 40s was arrested at the scene.
It gave this summary, completely inventing a value for the plants the man was growing and assuming -- perhaps incorrectly -- that they were cannabis plants:
Police have arrested a man in his late 40s after cannabis plants worth an estimated £100,000 were found in a warehouse near Ashbourne.
This phenomenon also shows why a tool like Microsoft's Bing chatbot can get things wrong as it retrieves information from the internet. If you ask the chatbot a question, it can call Microsoft's Bing search engine and run an internet search. But it has no way of pinpointing the right answer. It grabs the results of that internet search and summarizes them for you.
Sometimes, this summary is very flawed. Some bots will cite internet addresses that are entirely made up.
Companies like OpenAI, Google and Microsoft have developed ways to improve the accuracy of their technologies. OpenAI, for example, tries to refine its technology with feedback from human testers, who rate the chatbot's responses, separating useful and truthful answers from those that are not. Then, using a technique called reinforcement learning, the system spends weeks analyzing the ratings to better understand what it is fact and what is fiction.
But researchers warn that chatbot hallucination is not an easy problem to solve. Because chatbots learn from patterns in data and operate according to probabilities, they behave in unwanted ways at least some of the time.
To determine how often the chatbots hallucinated when summarizing news articles, Vectara's researchers used another large language model to check the accuracy of each summary. That was the only way of efficiently checking such a huge number of summaries.
But James Zou, a Stanford computer science professor, said this method came with a caveat. The language model doing the checking can also make mistakes.
"The hallucination detector could be fooled -- or hallucinate itself," he said.

New Leadership for Bumble, Women-Focused Dating App: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ms. Wolfe Herd, who founded the women-centered dating app in 2014, will be replaced by Lidiane Jones, the chief executive of Slack.
Whitney Wolfe Herd, who founded the women-centered dating app Bumble a decade ago, is stepping down and will be replaced by Lidiane Jones, the chief executive of the workplace-messaging platform Slack, Bumble said on Monday.
Ms. Jones will succeed Ms. Wolfe Herd as chief executive of Bumble on Jan. 2, the company said. Ms. Wolfe Herd will remain at Bumble as its executive chair. The news was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
Ms. Wolfe Herd, 34, who also is a co-founder of the dating app Tinder, said in a statement that she was passing the baton to a leader and a woman she deeply respected.
"This move to executive chair gives me the ability to step forward into a new and exciting role, get back to my founder roots and bring immense passion and focus to this next chapter of growth," she said.
Bumble, which requires women to make the first move, went public in 2021, briefly making Ms. Wolfe Herd one of the world's few female billionaires, according to Bloomberg. As of June, the dating app had 2.5 million paying users, according to Bumble's second-quarter earnings report. Bumble will report its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.
About a third of adults in the United States have used a dating app, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted last year. But dating apps reported sluggish revenue increases and a slump in user growth last year, underscoring concern among some investors that the industry is oversaturated, according to a Morgan Stanley report.
The stock price of Match Group, which owns dozens of online dating services including Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid, Hinge and Plenty of Fish, fell more than 15 percent on Wednesday, a day after the company lowered its 2023 revenue projections in its third-quarter earnings report. The number of users paying for Tinder fell 6 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, Match said.
Ms. Jones, a native of Brazil, took the helm at Slack, a workplace communication platform owned by Salesforce, in January. Before that, she was an executive at Salesforce and spent nearly 13 years at Microsoft. She told The Wall Street Journal that she was focused on how Bumble could use artificial intelligence to accelerate matchmaking on the app.
"As a woman who has spent her career in technology," Ms. Jones said in a statement, "it's a gift to lean on my experience to lead a company dedicated to women and encouraging equality, integrity and kindness, all deeply personal and inspiring to me."

The Five-Day Office Week Is Over: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Working from home is here to stay. I can prove it with data -- lots and lots of data showing that returning to the office (R.T.O.) is D.O.A.
A telling data point is the number tracking how many Americans swiped and tapped electronic cards to gain entry into their offices. This month, occupancy rates were at 50 percent of February 2020 levels. That is shocking -- only half as many days are spent in the office compared with prepandemic times.
That number has flatlined not only in office buildings in San Francisco and New York but also in workplaces in Atlanta; Charlotte, N.C.; Dallas; Denver; and Philadelphia. Blue and red, inland and coastal, Northern and Southern workers who might have disagreed on pandemic-related behaviors like mask wearing and vaccine boosters have quietly united behind work-from-home habits throughout 2023.
Work-from-home levels aren't as high as they were during the pandemic's first peak in early 2020, when 62 percent of full-day paid work happened at home. People began filtering back to the office as the pandemic waned. But they did so only to a point: By December 2022, 29 percent of workdays were happening from home. There was a slight dip after the winter holidays, to 27 percent in January 2023. But as of July, we are back up at 31 percent.
Why have the return-to-office maximalists lost? There seemed to be so much excitement and pent-up demand from people who wanted to leave their kitchen tables for ergonomically better office desks. There was. They just didn't want to go in all the time.
Hybrid work arrangements have killed the return-to-office hype. Employees equate a mix of working in the office and working from home to an 8 percent raise. They don't have to deal with the daily hassle and costs of a commute. In fact, the process of getting to work is more despised by employees than the need to actually work.
And at the end of the day, despite all the noise some business executives made to the contrary, remote work saves companies money. It cuts overhead, boosts productivity and is profitable. And what is profitable in a capitalist economy sticks. Thankfully, remote work also has major benefits for society, including improving the climate by cutting billions of miles of weekly commuting and supporting families by liberating parents' time. We all should celebrate the resilience of our workers and the benefits of working from home.
What about the news stories that companies like Zoom, whose videoconference product made it a star of remote work in the pandemic, are calling employees back to the office? Surely, if even Zoom is insisting that its workers be present in the office, this must be a significant trend, right?
I visited Zoom's headquarters in September 2022. Scores of people were present, and the office was busy. Intrigued, I asked about Zoom's work-from-home policy. I was told that many local employees were on a hybrid schedule, typically coming in a couple of days a week. Recently, Zoom formalized this. Employees living within 50 miles are required to work in the office twice a week. There is no requirement, however, for employees living more than 50 miles away.
The headlines could have read "Zoom confirms work-from-home three days a week for employees within 50 miles and five days for those outside 50 miles." But sadly, these types of subtleties are harder to get across. Companies like Amazon, Meta, Salesforce and Zoom discovered that many of their best performers love working from home and that enforcing a five-day-a-week return to the office would have meant culling their top talent.
What about the future? Could a recession and a change in our historically tight job market give bosses the upper hand and roll back these gains? I doubt it. Indeed, in 10 years, remote work is likely to increase, driven by two powerful economic forces.
First, U.S. data going back to the 1960s reveals a mere 0.4 percent of full days were worked from home in 1965. That doubled roughly every 15 years until 2019, driven by improving technology. First came personal computers in the 1980s, then laptops in the 1990s. The internet opened up more possibilities in the 2000s, followed by cloud file sharing and video calls in the 2010s.
As one of four children of two working parents, I saw what working from home was like without a computer or the internet. My parents would sporadically have to work from home when there were child-care emergencies, and it was challenging. In the 1980s remote work required carrying loads of paperwork to and from the office, and it meant being excluded from meetings and decisions at work. Now we can Zoom in on laptops, share files via the cloud and easily connect with colleagues. This rate of technological progress is accelerating, as higher rates of remote working lead companies to develop ever better software and hardware.
Second, we have business cohort effects. In the data, we see that more than 75 percent of start-ups allow employees flexible working locations. Start-up companies have been born in an era when having an office is optional and meeting customers and clients online is standard. Many of these companies have saved capital by forgoing offices and have saved on expensive urban salaries by hiring remote employees globally.
Today's new companies have nearly twice as many days worked from home as those founded 20 years ago. As these young companies grow and mature, they will turn into tomorrow's medium and large companies, bringing their remote-friendly practices with them. Perhaps as important, their founding chief executives will grow into tomorrow's business leaders. In 10 years, expect to see leading chief executives and entrepreneurs actively embracing hybrid work rather than begging employees to return to the office.
Change isn't easy. Some downtowns will need to reinvent themselves. But rarely as an economist do I see a change so profoundly positive for the majority of America's businesses and workers. We should support the working-from-home revolution that has finally yielded a win-win-win. Companies, employees and society all benefit. Typically, reforms involve trade-offs, with some groups winning and other groups losing. Remote work has been good for almost everyone involved. We should support this golden moment and lay the five-day-office-week movement to rest.
Nicholas A. Bloom is a professor of economics at Stanford University who has been researching work-from-home practices for the past 20 years.

'A.I. Agents' Can Play Minecraft. They're Just Getting Warmed Up.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Researchers are transforming chatbots into online agents that play games, query websites, schedule meetings, build bar charts and do more.
The widely used chatbot ChatGPT was designed to generate digital text, everything from poetry to term papers to computer programs. But when a team of artificial intelligence researchers at the computer chip company Nvidia got their hands on the chatbot's underlying technology, they realized it could do a lot more.
Within weeks, they taught it to play Minecraft, one of the world's most popular video games. Inside Minecraft's digital universe, it learned to swim, gather plants, hunt pigs, mine gold and build houses.
"It can go into the Minecraft world and explore by itself and collect materials by itself and get better and better at all kinds of skills," said a Nvidia senior research scientist, Linxi Fan, who is known as Jim.
The project was an early sign that the world's leading artificial intelligence researchers are transforming chatbots into a new kind of autonomous system called an A.I. agent. These agents can do more than chat. They can use software apps, websites and other online tools, including spreadsheets, online calendars, travel sites and more.
In time, many researchers say, the A.I. agents could become far more sophisticated, and could replace office workers, automating almost any white-collar job.
"This is a huge commercial opportunity, potentially trillions of dollars," said Jeff Clune, a computer science professor at the University of British Columbia who previously worked on this kind of technology as a researcher at OpenAI, the San Francisco start-up that built ChatGPT. "This has a huge upside -- and huge consequences -- for society."
Nvidia's agent plays a game. Similar agents can schedule meetings, edit files, analyze data and build multicolored bar charts. The idea is that these automated systems will eventually act as personal assistants able to handle a wide range of tasks across the internet.
Today's agents are limited, and they can't exactly organize your life. ChatGPT can search the travel site Expedia for flights to New York, but you still have to book the reservation on your own.
This technology, as researchers improve it, could make office workers and consumers more efficient. It could also change the nature of video games, providing a new wave of bots that gamers can play alongside and chat with.
GPT-4, the technology that underpins ChatGPT, is what researchers call a large language model. It is an A.I. system that learns skills by analyzing huge amounts of data.
Over the past several months, the technology has wowed hundreds of millions of people with the way it generates emails, writes speeches and riffs on almost any topic. But its most important skill may be its knack for writing computer programs.
It can instantly generate a program that draws a unicorn or drops digital snow across your laptop screen. Professional software developers can ask for code that they can fold into larger programs, including everything from social media apps to search engines. But that is only part of what this technology can do. It can also generate computer code that taps into other software apps and websites.
This is how Dr. Fan and other Nvidia researchers taught GPT-4 to play Minecraft. "The most important word here is code," Dr. Fan said. "Code can take actions."
People use software apps and websites by touching buttons, menus and other graphical widgets. A.I. agents use apps and websites by accessing their application programming interfaces, or A.P.I.s -- the underlying software code that lets them communicate with other online services.
If you ask an agent to upload a video to the internet, for instance, it could generate code that called an A.P.I. offered by YouTube. "An A.P.I. is just text used to talk to a machine," said Silen Naihin, a researcher who helps run an independent A.I. agent project, AutoGPT.
In theory, a chatbot can write code for access to any A.P.I. on the internet. But today's chatbots are not yet adept enough to do more than just simple tasks. And even if they were, letting them freely roam the internet would be an enormous security risk. So companies are starting small.
A few months after OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT, it quietly released a way for the chatbot to do more than generate text. After installing various plug-ins -- software that augments what the bot can do -- you could ask it to search travels sites like Expedia for available flights, grab a map of your hometown from Google Earth or even transform a spreadsheet detailing your yearly spending into a multicolored bar chart.
Equipped with a plug-in called code interpreter, ChatGPT could not just write code but also run it. This allowed the technology to instantly perform tasks it could not in the past, including editing spreadsheets and transforming still images into videos. Google, Microsoft and other companies are exploring similar technologies.
"These are projects where we're envisioning essentially A.I.s working with other A.I.s on your behalf," Ashley Llorens, a vice president at Microsoft, said.
Independent projects such as AutoGPT are trying to take this kind of thing several steps further. The idea is to give the system goals like "create a company" or "make some money." Then it will look for ways of reaching that goal by asking itself questions and connecting to other internet services.
Today, this does not work all that well. Systems like AutoGPT tend to get stuck in endless loops. But researchers like Dr. Fan are constantly refining this kind of technology in an effort to make it more useful and more reliable.
Other researchers are building a new kind of A.I. agent designed for using software tools. In summer 2022, Dr. Clune was among a team of OpenAI researchers who built an agent that could use computer software much as a person would -- mouse click by mouse click, keystroke by keystroke.
Dr. Clune and his colleagues fed the system hours of online videos that showed people playing Minecraft. By analyzing the way people used their mouse and keyboard to navigate through Minecraft's digital universe, the system learned to play the game on its own.
Other companies, including a start-up called Adept, are building similar agents that use websites like Wikipedia, Redfin and Craigslist and popular office apps from companies like Salesforce.
Dr. Clune argues that this kind of agent will eventually allow artificial intelligence to use a much broader range of software apps and websites. He said everyone would have access to a digital assistant that could potentially do almost anything on the internet. That could make life easier -- but it could also replace countless jobs.
"If A.I. can do anything we can do, it does not just replace the boring tasks," he said. "It replaces all the tasks."

Labor Groups Vexed by New California Senator's Work With Uber: [National Desk]

Full text: Laphonza Butler was part of Uber's push to avoid having to classify its drivers as employees. Her new appointment has drawn ire from labor advocates.
In the summer of 2019, Uber, Lyft and other companies that use contract drivers faced a crisis in California. The State Legislature was poised to pass a law that would effectively require them to treat their drivers as employees, meaning the gig companies would have to pay drivers a minimum wage, cover their expenses and contribute to state unemployment -- all significant new costs.
Desperate for a way out, the companies pushed legislators to exempt their drivers from the new law, saying they faced huge economic losses. But they wanted the backing of the state's unions for the exemption, and promised to extend some new benefits for drivers if the unions got on board.
So Uber brought in a team of high-powered consultants, including one whose connections with organized labor were unimpeachable: Laphonza Butler, the former president of California's largest union, a branch of the Service Employees International Union.
Ms. Butler, working through a prominent California consulting firm, advised Uber on how to deal with unions like the Teamsters and S.E.I.U., and sat in on several face-to-face meetings between the gig companies and union representatives, according to those familiar with the negotiations.
The overture to labor divided union activists, some of whom bristled at negotiating with the companies, and ultimately, it failed. But Ms. Butler's chapter with Uber proved to be a pivotal moment in her career, moving from labor activism to the world of high-powered political consulting, which also involved a role in advising Vice President Kamala Harris in her 2020 presidential campaign.
On Sunday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced that he was naming Ms. Butler as the state's next senator, replacing Dianne Feinstein, who died last week. Many Democrats cheered the appointment of Ms. Butler, the third Black woman to serve in the Senate and a prominent figure in Democratic politics for more than a decade who most recently served as president of Emily's List, the political action committee that works to elect women and candidates who support abortion rights.
But the appointment has also drawn ire from labor advocates, who have not forgotten Ms. Butler's work consulting with Uber, which some saw as an uncomfortable reversal from her history in the labor movement and the values she promoted there.
"The sense was she was betraying her commitment to working people," said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law, who has argued that Uber's drivers should be classified as employees. "She sold out in a really big way."
The negotiations Ms. Butler was involved in eventually fell apart, and the gig companies turned to a ballot initiative with similar provisions, Proposition 22, that voters passed the following year. Supporters of Ms. Butler said her time consulting for Uber was scarcely a blip compared with her long history of labor advocacy, which includes organizing hundreds of thousands of workers in nursing homes and home-based care and successfully pushing for a statewide $ 15-per-hour minimum wage.
"Labor hasn't had a union leader in the Senate in 60 years -- let alone a union president who spent nearly two decades leading successful campaigns to raise the minimum wage and help workers organize," said Jeffrey Lerner, the acting chief of staff for Ms. Butler. "That's Senator Butler's résumé and those are her values."
Ms. Butler declined to be interviewed for this article but told The San Francisco Chronicle this week that she believed gig drivers "should have the protections of employment," and said her role with Uber "was one that was consistent with my résumé." Uber also declined to comment.
In 2019, Mr. Newsom's administration encouraged the gig companies and labor unions to work out their differences over the issue, several people involved in the discussions said. Uber and Lyft wanted to persuade the unions to back a bill they could bring to the Legislature that would exempt their drivers from Assembly Bill 5, which would treat many categories of gig workers, like freelance writers and janitors, as employees for the purposes of employment law.
In exchange for the exemption, the gig companies would agree that the drivers could receive some limited benefits and join "network driver advocacy organizations" in which the state's unions would represent them and negotiate for some labor rights.
Ms. Butler was brought in as well, with Uber paying the team at the consulting firm where she worked, SCRB Strategies, now known as Bearstar Strategies, $ 185,000 in 2019 and 2020. She was seen essentially as a translator, helping company managers understand the subtleties of labor leaders' positions and frame arguments in ways that would appeal to the unions, according to several people familiar with the discussions, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss internal Uber issues or did not want to air internal conflicts in the labor movement.
One person said Ms. Butler was expected to take on other tasks as well, including talking with her former union colleagues about a possible compromise. It was also expected that she might help with a public relations strategy to persuade lawmakers and the general public that AB-5 could have negative effects on gig workers, though it was not clear whether she agreed to do so.
Ms. Butler participated in occasional conference calls with the company's public affairs team, according to two people with knowledge of the calls. She answered their questions and advised Uber to use fewer vague tech industry buzzwords and be more straightforward in communicating with the unions.
Ms. Butler told the Uber employees that she would help them as long as it did not betray her values, one of the people recalled.
Still, Ms. Butler's presence on the other side of the negotiating table rankled many of the state's most prominent labor unions, several union officials said, although they did not want to discuss the matter publicly because they did not want to cross Mr. Newsom and Ms. Butler.
The months of discussions stretched from consultants' offices in Sacramento to hotels in Oakland and the headquarters of Uber and Salesforce in San Francisco. They included large group negotiations, forums for drivers to share their views with labor organizers and smaller sit-downs between the unions' top negotiators and gig company executives, including John Zimmer, the former president of Lyft, and Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer and the brother-in-law of Vice President Harris.
Ms. Butler's role during the meetings she attended was minimal, according to several people. She sat on the sidelines listening, exchanged brief niceties with the union leaders she knew and once made introductions during a meeting in which drivers gave their perspective to the two parties.
Leaders of S.E.I.U., the union where Ms. Butler had formerly worked, were the most amenable to cutting a deal, according to two people involved in the discussions. But many other unions were strongly opposed, fearing they were bargaining away crucial employment rights for vulnerable workers. The talks fizzled out.
Assembly Bill 5 passed that fall and took effect the following year, but Uber and Lyft eventually got what they wanted anyway, joining DoorDash to spend more than $ 200 million on Prop. 22, passed by voters in 2020, which maintained gig drivers' status as independent contractors and provided them limited benefits, like a wage floor and some health insurance stipends. The measure is currently facing a legal challenge.
Ms. Butler was not involved in the Prop. 22 campaign and left the consulting firm in 2020 to become a director of public policy at Airbnb, the short-term home rental company launched in San Francisco.
Like Uber, Airbnb has faced regulatory heat in Democratic, union-friendly strongholds like New York, where the company was being blamed for pushing up rents for working class residents and hurting hotel jobs. (Airbnb has said many other factors have caused rents to rise in New York and that its business model has helped drive down lodging costs for consumers.) One of the company's chief adversaries in New York had been the Hotel Trades Council, a powerful union.
Mary Kay Henry, S.E.I.U.'s international president, said Ms. Butler was a "transformational" labor leader and suggested that her pro-worker voice being part of Uber's negotiating team may have been a benefit for workers.
"She's who I'd want in the room helping corporations understand what workers want and need," Ms. Henry said.
But the animosity Ms. Butler engendered among organized labor remains, and supporters of those running for the permanent Senate seat -- who include Representatives Adam Schiff, Barbara Lee and Katie Porter -- have been quick to resurrect the issue. If Ms. Butler runs for a full term, the unions will have to decide whether to support her. Some, including a firefighters' union, a film set workers' union and a public transit union have already endorsed Mr. Schiff.
The deadline to seek the endorsement of the California Democratic Party was originally Oct. 13, but the party decided this week to push back that date to Oct. 27 to give Ms. Butler time to apply if she decides to run, said Rusty Hicks, the state party's chair.
For some Democrats, Ms. Butler's appointment draws attention to a deeper messaging problem within the Democratic Party. Mr. Newsom might get credit for appointing an L.G.B.T.Q. Black senator, but her consulting work, to some, highlights the party's ties to big businesses.
"This is why many working class voters have this distaste for the Democratic Party and a lot of them went to Trump," said Larry Cohen, the former president of the Communications Workers of America, which represents hundreds of thousands of workers at companies like Verizon and AT&T.
Mr. Cohen is now chairman of Our Revolution, a progressive advocacy group that recently endorsed Ms. Lee.
But Anthony York, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, defended the governor's appointment. "Anyone casting doubt on Senator Butler's record of fighting for working families either doesn't know what they're talking about or has some sort of political ax to grind," he said.

IBM Tries Assuring Customers Generative A.I. Is a Safe Bet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company will assume the legal risk of businesses that use its A.I. systems and will publish the technology's underlying data.
There is no shortage of excitement in corporate America for the new artificial intelligence that can produce everything from business reports to computer code with humanlike fluency.
Plenty of companies are experimenting with the technology, called generative A.I., but they are worried about how confidential data will be handled, the accuracy of A.I.-generated answers and potential legal liability.
IBM on Thursday announced its campaign to ease customers' qualms. The company said it would indemnify companies against copyright or other intellectual property claims for using its generative A.I. systems. IBM will also publish its data sets -- the underlying data that is used to build or "train" the A.I. system -- which is not standard practice among commercial providers of generative A.I. technology.
The announcement is an indication that, while attention has been focused on the new A.I. technology in chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, IBM is laying its plans to tackle the market.
IBM's customers are mostly other businesses, and persuading those companies to use new A.I. products means assuring them that they won't run into legal trouble. OpenAI, for example, has already been sued by a collection of authors who accuse it of infringing on their copyrights by using their books to train ChatGPT.
Over the last year, start-ups like OpenAI and other industry giants like Google and Microsoft have been much more aggressive than IBM about publicly discussing their A.I. work. Even Meta, the parent company of Facebook, this week introduced A.I. chatbots meant to sound like celebrities such as the quarterback Tom Brady and the hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg.
IBM's relatively quiet stance showed how much the tech industry had changed in the 12 years since IBM's Watson A.I. system beat top competitors on "Jeopardy!" A.I. became a centerpiece of IBM's pitch to corporate customers, but the company has been overshadowed by younger competitors in the nearly yearlong A.I. frenzy in the tech industry.
Other technology suppliers are also trying to reassure customers by assuming legal risks. Microsoft pledged this month to defend customers in any copyright suits that arise from using its A.I.-powered Copilots, which it is adding to its office productivity software and programming tools. Adobe has made a similar commitment for copyright claims against customers using Adobe Firefly, its A.I. art-generation software.
The IBM A.I. systems -- or "models," as developers call them -- are tailored for use by businesses. And the training data has been curated with companies in mind and culled from the internet, academic journals, computer code repositories, and legal and finance documents, the company said.
IBM appears to be going further than other companies in taking on risk and opening up its model-training data. But it is in step with where the business market for generative A.I. is heading, said Patrick Moorhead, chief executive of Moor Insights & Strategy, a technology analysis firm.
The big A.I.-fueled consumer services like ChatGPT and Google's Bard are closed, and people outside the companies behind them cannot usually see what data those systems are built on. That will not satisfy most corporate customers, Mr. Moorhead said.
"Businesses need to know the data inputs and get a sense of why you got the answer you did," he said. "Putting their customer or confidential data into an A.I. model is seen as high risk for a business."
IBM is positioning itself as a partner for companies that want to create their own A.I. technology, by adding their business data to IBM's open models.
The early focus of most business technology companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP, has largely been on embedding generative A.I. to improve their existing digital tools for office productivity, supply chain management, customer service and marketing.
IBM will deploy that A.I. in its products as well, but its emphasis is helping businesses become creators, as well as customers, of generative A.I. technology.
In business, the A.I. models are large, but far smaller than needed for the big consumer chatbots, said Rob Thomas, IBM's senior vice president for software. The narrower focus also helps improve accuracy. "And for our market, accuracy is way more important than size," he said.
The smaller models also require far less computing firepower than the giant consumer chatbots. That, Mr. Thomas said, should open the door to wider use of generative A.I. in operations that promise an immediate impact and payoff, including customer service, automated back-office tasks and digital assistants for writing code.
In those fields, "we see a defensible return on investment at the moment," Mr. Thomas said. "The economics work."

At Work, 'Whole Selves' Increasingly Include Religion: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Secular companies have invited employees to bring their "whole selves" to work. That increasingly includes their religion.
When Christy Childers moved from Austin to San Francisco in 2017 to start a marketing job at Facebook, she felt anxious about sharing her evangelical faith with her new colleagues. In Ms. Childers's religious community, Silicon Valley has a reputation for being overtly secular and less than accepting of Christian beliefs. She now calls that view "unfounded." Within a week, colleagues had invited her to a lunchtime Bible study and a happy hour attended by scores of Christians across the tech industry.
"I thought, 'I can be out about being a Christian. I can do that here,"' Ms. Childers said.
During her three years as a brand manager, Ms. Childers's evangelical identity became central to her work. She honed her managerial skills by leading the Christians at Facebook (now Christians at Meta) employee resource group. Weekly prayer meetings with colleagues led to what she called "real-time miracles," like engineers suddenly fixing bugs they'd struggled with for months and solutions to P.R. crises. Company leaders also consulted her about the attitudes of conservative Facebook users.
In 2019, Ms. Childers founded Pray for Tech, a nonprofit that supports Christian prayer communities inside tech companies. The next year, she left Facebook to run the organization full time. She has since worked with Christian groups at 40 companies, where she's observed a growing interest in supporting workers' core identities, including their faith.
This corporate effort to create a sense of belonging at work grew after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, when many companies rushed to improve their diversity, equity and inclusion, or D.E.I., efforts. Employees from underrepresented groups were encouraged to bring their "authentic" or "whole" selves to work, and companies increased support for identity-based employee groups organized around gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation.
Increasingly, faith is a part of this list. Human resources professionals, diversity consultants and scholars all say it's become more common for employees to share their religious identities at work and to request the same corporate recognition and support given to other identity groups. Most major tech companies now have official faith-based affinity groups.
Fueling the effort are multiple Christian organizations including Pray for Tech; anti-discrimination nonprofits, like the Anti-Defamation League; and nonpartisan, multifaith nonprofits like Interfaith America and the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation.
"It feels like the train is moving and as imperfect as the D.E.I. vehicle is, hop on or hop off and get religion into the larger ecosystem," said Simran Jeet Singh, executive director of the Religion & Society Program at the Aspen Institute. "It's almost like, here's a way for people of faith to say, think about us too."
Twenty years ago, few secular companies recognized faith-based employee groups and those that did exist -- whether officially sanctioned or not -- were typically for Christians. Today, nearly 70 secular corporations officially fund them, according to the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, and scores more allow them to exist. Many groups are new since 2017, some have thousands of members and represent Christians, Muslims and Jews, along with Sikhs, Buddhists, Baha'is and even atheists.
Scholars call this a cultural shift. The secular office has long been "a neutral space, where there is separating out of religion," said Helen Chung, an assistant professor of industrial-organizational psychology at Seattle Pacific University who studies faith-based employee resource groups. This is partly "a carry-over from the separation of church and state," Ms. Chung said, and partly a way to keep the peace. "What are the two things you're not supposed to talk about?" said Brian Grim, president of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation. "Religion and politics."
Inviting employees to bring their whole selves to the workplace means companies should be prepared to host some difficult conversations. "That doesn't mean companies have to weigh in on Israel-Palestine," Mr. Singh said. But, he said, workers of faith "have real issues that they'll be bringing to the table, and you have to be ready to address them."
'We shouldn't be hiding'
Americans may be turning away from organized religion, but a fifth still view their work as a spiritual calling, according to a nationally representative survey from Rice University.
"Historically, religious institutions have provided people a context, a container to mark transitions in their lives and do some meaning making," Ms. Chung said. "But some of that has lessened, and I think because of that, we look to recreate some structures for ourselves in the workplace."
Employees who have joined workplace faith groups or otherwise integrated religion into their professional lives, often do so for emotional support. Ms. Childers's organization, Pray for Tech, facilitates virtual inter-company prayer sessions, like one last March, where employees from Meta, Microsoft and Yahoo prayed for strength in the face of layoffs.
At PayPal, workers can submit requests to a "prayer portal," asking that colleagues pray for them. "A lot of times it's around a health diagnosis. Or a prayer for leadership and wisdom during difficult economic times," said Becky Pomerleau, the company's senior director of audit, who helped found both the company's interfaith and Christian affinity groups in 2019.
Sukie Singh Gandhi, a technical consulting manager at Salesforce, said engaging with her Sikh faith at work helps her feel seen and respected as a religious minority. Ms. Gandhi is global vice president of Faithforce, a 5,000-member affinity group at her company, and part of the "Sikhs at Salesforce" Slack channel -- positions she's used to help out her Sikh colleagues.
Some Sikhs, for example, are required to carry a kirpan, a small ceremonial dagger that represents justice and courage. Yet they worry colleagues or security will misconstrue the kirpan as a weapon. After her colleagues raised these concerns on the Slack channel last year, Ms. Gandhi helped convene meetings with executives, security officials and employees to discuss the issue.
As a result of these talks, Sikhs who want to carry a kirpan at work now receive special notation on their employee badges.
Ms. Gandhi found this experience empowering. "That is who I am," she said. "We shouldn't be hiding."
In fact, many religious employees say they were closeted about their faith before "coming out" to colleagues. Michael Roberts, a Salesforce engineer, said it took him three years to come out as an evangelical Christian. Once he did, he became a founding member of Faithforce.
A few years later, at age 30, Mr. Roberts came out as gay. After learning that he was in a same-sex relationship, his longtime church rejected him. But his Faithforce colleagues had the opposite response. "They were amazing champions," Mr. Roberts said. "That was a significant source of strength for me in that hard transition."
Difficult conversations
Companies with faith-based affinity groups are quick to emphasize how deeply their employees respect one another. But as religious workers become more vocal inside secular workplaces, "one potential downside is that what's safe and creates a more inclusive environment for one group might have an opposite or negative impact for another group," said Katina Sawyer, associate professor of management and organizations at the University of Arizona, who studies workplace inclusion. "That's not something organizations have necessarily thought about in great detail."
The Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against workers based on their religion, race, gender, nationality or sexual orientation. But recent Supreme Court decisions seem to have privileged religious freedoms, like exempting health plans at companies with religious objections from providing contraception under the Affordable Care Act or allowing a religious social services nonprofit to turn away same-sex foster parents.
In June, a unanimous Supreme Court decision made it easier for people to seek religious accommodations at work. Typically, such accommodations involve holiday time off or wearing religious dress. But Steven Green, director of the Center for Religion, Law and Democracy at Willamette University, thinks the ruling could open the door for other demands -- like the ability to proselytize, which is a core tenet of some faiths. "Some religious public interest groups are creating a narrative that you must be able to bring your entire self into the workplace," he said, "and that means your ability to evangelize, which has been inhibited."
During a recent Pride month, members of some faith-based employee groups at a large tech company grew frustrated over their employer's overt L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy. Some considered organizing a walkout. An adviser to the Christian affinity group, who requested anonymity to preserve his professional relationships, counseled the frustrated employees to consider how such an event would affect their L.G.B.T.Q. colleagues. The walkout never happened.
Mr. Grim, of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, recalled hearing about another incident in which an employee sent a mass email inviting staff to a Bible study. Mr. Grim says that the appropriate employer response should depend on the situation: If a supervisor sent the email, it could be considered coercive if it is viewed as mandatory or somehow consequential to an employee's place in the company. But if a rank-and-file employee is permitted to send a mass email invitation to a baby shower or Pride parade, then Bible study should be fair game.
Not every company is prepared to grapple with these questions. It's possibly why only 43 Fortune 500 companies officially recognize faith-based affinity groups, according to an assessment by Mr. Grim's organization.
"We're often approached by diversity professionals who are really versed in race, gender, sexuality, and they're like, "Oh, I don't get religion, and I'm not comfortable with it," said Megan Johnson, senior director for strategic initiatives at the nonpartisan, nonprofit Interfaith America. "Especially when these groups might come up against that person's own value set."
In 2021, Rebecca Leeman was an organizational consultant at PwC in Manhattan, when a man wearing a skullcap was assaulted near the company's Midtown offices. He had been on his way to a pro-Israel demonstration. Ms. Leeman said the company sent a mass email condemning the assault and even mentioned it during an all-hands meeting, but never used the word "anti-Semitism."
"Because of the connections to Israel and politics, I think they were intentionally vague," Ms. Leeman said. She felt the company needed to understand the very specific fear she'd been feeling about her Jewish identity in recent years.
She co-wrote a letter to Tim Ryan, then the company's U.S. chair, requesting that PwC recognize a formal Jewish affinity group. The company responded swiftly. Within a few months, they'd authorized an interfaith organization with a Jewish group under its umbrella.
'Feel-good stuff' vs. shared identity
Companies like an interfaith approach to religion in the workplace, because it allows them to focus on education and sidestep potential conflict. Last December, PayPal hosted its first interfaith fair, complete with turban tying and henna painting. This winter, PwC will host a lunch and learn about workers' different holiday traditions. Each spring, a handful of companies hold Ramadan "fast-a-thons" in which non-Muslims fast for one day alongside their Muslim colleagues.
At Dell, there is a single multifaith group with six religions represented but no faith-specific communities -- at least none the company officially recognizes. "Those become divisive and exclusive," said Vanice Hayes, Dell's chief culture, diversity and inclusion officer. "We are all about making sure people don't feel siloed."
Mr. Singh of the Aspen Institute agrees that an interfaith approach can help avoid polarization, but he worries the "feel-good stuff" can "fall really flat, because it's too superficial." He added that workers from minority faiths often want a space "to find their people on the basis of some shared identity and heritage." That's especially important, he said, with hate crimes on the rise.
In late 2022, the Anti-Defamation League started a Jewish Employee Resource Group Network to address growing inquiries from Jewish employees and D.E.I. officers. "Excluding Jews or bundling them in a much bigger group reinforces that signal that Jews are not vulnerable, aren't a minority group," said Adam Neufeld, senior vice president and chief impact officer of the A.D.L. "We think they are."
Access to a like-minded community also provides the safety some workers need to step outside of it. Steve Teng, whose Austin nonprofit Pivot helps Christians start Christ-centered communities at work, said some people have been taught to think that entering interfaith spaces means they're abandoning their own theology. "I tell them, don't be scared," he said. "When you receive ideas, you also get to share them. That's dignifying people of every kind."

Macy's Names C.E.O.
For Bloomingdale's
Macy's named Olivier Bron, right, the next chief executive of Bloomingdale's, the company's luxury chain, on Tuesday, the latest move in a leadership shuffle this year.
Mr. Bron was previously chief executive of Central Group's Central and Robinson Department Stores in Thailand. He will start in November, succeeding Tony Spring. Macy's announced this year that Mr. Spring would be elevated to chief executive of Macy's in February after the planned retirement of Jeff Gennette, who has led the company since 2017.
Macy's has ambitions to become more competitive in e-commerce as younger shoppers pull away from department stores. Mr. Gennette previously said Bloomingdale's had worked as a "scrappy incubator" for ideas that made their way to Macy's.
Macy's, the largest department store chain in the United States, has been feeling pressure as consumers increasingly tighten their purse strings amid stubborn inflation. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Macy's said sales had dropped 8 percent from a year earlier. Bloomingdale's, which targets higher-earning shoppers, was less affected but still reported a 2.6 percent decline in sales.
Macy's also reported a "faster than expected" rise in credit card delinquencies.
"Over the last several quarters, we have seen the Macy's customer more aggressively pull back on spend in our discretionary categories," Mr. Gennette told analysts in an Aug. 22 earnings call. "They are not converting as easily and becoming more intentional on the allocation of their disposable income with an ongoing shift to services and experiences." J. EDWARD MORENO
TECHNOLOGY
Eight More Companies
Pledge to Make A.I. Safe
The White House said on Tuesday that eight more companies involved in artificial intelligence had pledged to voluntarily follow standards for safety, security and trust with the fast-evolving technology.
The companies include Adobe, IBM, Palantir, Nvidia and Salesforce. They joined Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection AI, Microsoft and OpenAI, which initiated an industry-led effort on safeguards in an announcement with the White House in July. The companies have committed to testing and other security measures, which are not regulations and are not enforced by the government.
Grappling with A.I. has become paramount since OpenAI released the powerful ChatGPT chatbot last year. The technology has since been under scrutiny for affecting people's jobs, spreading misinformation and potentially developing its own intelligence.
On Wednesday, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Sundar Pichai of Google will be among a dozen tech executives meeting with lawmakers in a closed-door A.I. summit hosted by Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York.
"The president has been clear: Harness the benefits of A.I., manage the risks and move fast -- very fast," the White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients, said in a statement. "And we are doing just that by partnering with the private sector and pulling every lever we have to get this done."
The companies agreed to include testing future products for security risks and using watermarks to make sure consumers can spot A.I.-generated material. They also agreed to share information about security risks across the industry and report any potential biases in their systems. CECILIA KANG

Full text: At an office in SoHo, rows of desks sit empty, while a shaggy dog -- shadowing an owner nostalgic for work-from-home comforts -- wanders the conference rooms. At a tech workplace downtown, a gaggle of 20-somethings divide into teams, calling out "Who's on the Orange team?" and "We're going to kill it!" as part of a game night enticing them back to in-person work. On the subway, commuters delight in a once-unimaginable indulgence: bag-spreading across two seats.
About a year and a half after Mayor Eric Adams chided workers -- "You can't stay home in your pajamas all day!" -- New York's offices in late August were under 41 percent of their prepandemic occupancy. Just 9 percent of the city's office workers were going in five days a week at the start of the year, according to the Partnership for New York City, a business group. Remote-work levels crisscrossing the country are more mixed, with just under one-third of America's workdays now done from home.
But in New York, the broad feeling across offices is one that locals know well: It's like sitting on the subway waiting to get somewhere and then feeling the car lurch to a stop. It sits there. Nobody has any idea when it's going to move again. Passengers eye one another, feeling fidgety and useless.
That's the limbo that the real estate industry is experiencing now, as companies try to fill their offices back up. Building owners are waiting for movement. Few know what to do in the meantime.
Caught in the midst of that stall is Eric Gural, whose family has a commercial real estate empire in New York City, GFP Real Estate, which owns and manages more than 55 properties and 13 million square feet, or some 2 percent of the city's office real estate.
This isn't the first time Mr. Gural's family has seen the real estate market falter. There was 2008, during the Great Recession, when a Cushman & Wakefield senior managing director reported: "The news out there has been bone-jarring." There was the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when headlines declared: "Office Vacancies in Downtowns Surge." There was the economic downturn in 1990, when a real estate professional confessed, in an article about office vacancies: "People are afraid."
But this time feels different. The value of New York's office buildings could fall nearly $ 50 billion in the coming years, according to researchers at Columbia and New York University.
"Covid hit everybody," Mr. Gural, 55, said. "Who did well in Covid?"
Through most of the city's previous economic busts, Mr. Gural's grandfather Aaron, a longtime leader of the family's real estate business, was confident that people would want cheap New York office space. "No matter what, there's going to be demand at 10 bucks a foot," was his thinking, according to his grandson's recollection.
That wisdom now sounds shaky. It's an eerie moment for commercial real estate, which has been rattled before but never so fundamentally. New York's office vacancy rate has surged more than 70 percent since 2019; there's some 96 million square feet of office real estate available for lease in the city. Delinquency rates for office loans across the United States are at a pandemic-era peak of nearly 5 percent.
Building owners are conceding uncertainty as another Labor Day approaches, the third since vaccines rolled out, and as executives across major employers again ratchet up calls for a return to the office. Economists worry that empty offices could lead to an "urban doom loop": Fewer people commute, downtown and midtown businesses suffer, tax revenue dips, and it gets tougher for cities to keep public services running.
To try to figure out what happens next, it seemed instructive to speak with someone for whom the vacancy numbers have specific urgency -- someone who owns that empty office space.
Asked about the worst-case scenario for his own business, Mr. Gural said: "Rents will be lower. Occupancy will be lower. We won't be as profitable. The worst part about that is that it might affect some of the philanthropy we do."
He is staying confident, for the time being, partly by pinning hopes on a broader return to the office. He takes inspiration from his own two children, both in their 20s, who tell him that they want the experience of commuting on the subway and working far from their couches.
"Young people want to work in an office -- what's the Seinfeld line? 'I finally figured out why we have kids, because they're here to replace us,"' Mr. Gural said, recalling the spirit if not the letter of the Jerry Seinfeld canon. "The next trove of office workers, of professionals, they're going to want to work in offices."
He later added: "The only two great things that weren't made in the office were fire and the wheel."
This isn't the first time New Yorkers have faced down crises by employing Seinfeld-inflected magical thinking. But a crisis is one thing. What about a permanent shift in the way we work and live? As building owners watch to see how permanent the hybrid shift will be, some have adopted a new mantra: "Survive until '25."
Location Is Everything
People driving into Manhattan in the summertime tend to want ice cream. That's a lesson that Mr. Gural's grandfather learned, in the 1930s, when he had his first foray into business, selling cones at a stoplight near the George Washington Bridge.
"Meet people where they are," Mr. Gural said, describing his grandfather's thinking.
That philosophy guided his approach to commercial real estate. Rather than compete with friends for the city's fanciest properties, its Park and Fifth Avenue gems, the Gural family bought up cheap manufacturing spaces in convenient locations. The company focused on what are known as Class B offices: unadorned properties, many of them in the garment district, instead of Class A gleaming towers like those at Hudson Yards. Roughly 33 percent of the city's office buildings are Class B, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate investment company.
Coming out of the pandemic, the Gural family's approach could put their business in a more difficult position. Real estate agents say they are witnessing a "flight to quality," in which tenants flock toward fancy spaces in the hopes of drawing workers back to the office. That means the office crisis for Class B owners is especially acute.
Class B properties often look like the stereotype of a New York office: old-school brick, small windows, kitchens with mealy apples, elevators that feel like they haven't been fixed up since the Giuliani administration. The sort of places people might not return to voluntarily. Many companies fighting to get their workers back are now eyeing flashier spots, the type with juice bars and treadmills in the building.
"The owners of Class B buildings are in a terrible predicament," said Ruth Colp-Haber, chief executive of Wharton Property Advisors, a real estate brokerage. "They are facing a tsunami of pressures, and some will be washed away with the tide."
There are three real plays available to office building owners in the increasingly grim game of their business.
Owners could invest in their properties to try to make them more appealing, turning B-minus buildings into B-plus ones with new amenities -- sleeker lobbies and elevators, coffee shops, even gyms.
Landlords could default on their loans and hand a building's keys back to their banks; after all, defaulting on a mortgage loan for one property doesn't typically allow the bank to touch others.
Then there's the conversion path, turning office buildings into housing, hotels, retail spaces and laboratories. Between 3 and 10 percent of New York City's offices could be good candidates for conversion, according to experts, often meaning the buildings are narrow enough that they can be broken up into windowed apartments.
Beyond converting a space, dumping it or "classing it up," there is another possible course of action (or really inaction) for landlords: Wait and see.
Hope that office workers come back, and that interest rates decline in the meantime. Pray that young people miss the grind and that one day soon they'll embrace their old commutes, allowing that stalled subway to get back in motion.
"This is a very very slow-moving trend," Ms. Colp-Haber said. "You can push the can down the road as much as you can."
Mr. Gural said his company at worst would "tread water," noting that many of GFP's deals are with small tenants that aren't tracked in reports on the industry. He doesn't believe that GFP will have to give any of its buildings back to the banks.
Sprinkled across Manhattan are Gural properties that are cruising along as smoothly as ever. Take the elegant brick building at 100 Crosby Street, formerly home to Soho's Dean & Deluca. It now houses Converse and Aritzia, among other tenants -- and has no space available for lease, according to CoStar.
Other properties are struggling. Two of GFP's buildings on West 34th Street have nearly 30 percent of their space available for rent.
The company got a three-year extension this year on a mortgage loan for one of its landmark properties, the DuMont Building, a 42-story Art Deco tower at 515 Madison Avenue, after defaulting on a $ 103 million loan for the property. Mr. Gural is also in negotiations for a loan extension on a Union Square office building.
The family expects to request extensions on more. But as long as the banks allow the Gurals loan extensions -- and it's not as if the banks want the keys to the buildings -- there's no reason for the family to give up on any of its properties just yet.
"People will come back to the office," said Mr. Gural, whose employees at GFP have been expected to be in the office three days a week -- though that bumps up to four after Labor Day.
"I don't think the whole world has been doing it wrong for the last 100 years," he added. "I just don't. There are so many successful things that have gone on in the world. One of the things they had in common was they had an office."
Mr. Gural is hanging in the same limbo as the rest of the city, though for him the stakes are quite personal.
His outlook is rosier than that of Manus Clancy, senior managing director at Trepp, a commercial real estate data firm.
"The office market is quite -- what's the word? -- unloved," Mr. Clancy said. "We're going to see an awful lot of defaults."
'Blood Coming Out of Our Nose'
Standing on the steps of the New York County courthouse in May, throngs of men (and they were mostly men) wearing well-fitted suits called out competing bids to buy the Flatiron Building -- a strange battle for an office landmark when its future seems wildly uncertain.
"We begin the bidding at $ 50 million!" the auctioneer said.
The Gural family won, buying out its partner to fully own the building for $ 161 million. Standing in a cluster of reporters afterward, GFP's chairman, Jeff Gural (Eric's father), announced that he was exploring converting at least half of the Flatiron into housing, possibly condominiums. The Gurals are also considering whether some of the building can be used for hotel space.
It's a recognition that the future of their real estate profile will look different, no matter how broad of a return to office the city sees.
After all, when companies start offering charitable donations on behalf of all employees coming into the office, as Salesforce did in June, it's a cry for help. Many real estate industry experts argue that there's no case for optimism for the city's Class B office owners.
"In many cases, unfortunately, their option may be handing over the keys to your lender," said Josh Zegen, managing principal and co-founder of Madison Realty Capital, which specializes in financing commercial real estate. "You're starting to see more and more of that happen."
Meanwhile, some city leaders are fighting for more office-to-residential conversions, as the population of city homeless shelters reaches 100,000. In August, Mayor Adams announced plans to convert more buildings in Manhattan to residential spaces, by rezoning manufacturing areas in Midtown and by allowing buildings built as recently as 1990 to be converted into housing.
Right now, only those built before 1977 or 1961, depending on location, can be converted. The plan would require City Council approval.
The Gurals have urged more support for office conversions, too. Eric Gural's cousin Brian Steinwurtzel is helping to oversee for GFP what would be the country's largest-ever conversion of a building from offices to housing, creating some 1,300 apartments at 25 Water Street. But Mr. Gural stressed that building owners needed rezoning policies and tax incentives to propel conversions.
"We've just lost every round of a 15-round fight," Mr. Gural said of the city's building owners. "We're lying on the mat. We have blood coming out of our nose. And our head hurts."
For a bloodied fighter, Mr. Gural spoke with a sense of cheer. Sitting in a blues bar in Midtown West, he picked up a butter knife and turned it on its edge. He explained that the bar, like the butter knife, is extremely narrow -- meaning it could be repurposed to house people.
Looking around the neon-lit space, mostly empty on a weekday at lunch, the eternal New York optimist declared: "I can make apartments here."

NEW YORK — At an office in SoHo, rows of desks sit empty, while a shaggy dog — shadowing an owner nostalgic for work-from-home comforts — wanders the conference rooms.

Hyundai and LG Planning Infusion for Georgia Plant
Hyundai and LG Energy Solution said Thursday that they would spend an additional $ 2 billion and hire an extra 400 workers to make batteries at the automaker's electrical vehicle plant that's under construction in Georgia. The announcement by the South Korea-based companies expands on a partnership they began three months ago to produce batteries at the same site west of Savannah where Hyundai plans to start E.V. production in 2025. The news brings the companies' total investment in the Georgia plant to more than $ 7.5 billion and the site's overall planned work force to 8,500. It's not clear whether the additional investment and jobs announced Thursday mean the Hyundai/LG battery plant will produce more batteries. When the joint venture was first announced in May, the companies said they would supply batteries for 300,000 E.V.s a year. Hyundai has said the Georgia plant could later expand to build 500,000 vehicles annually. ASSOCIATED PRESS

J.C. Penney Will Spend $ 1 Billion on Upgrades
J.C. Penney said Thursday that it planned to spend more than $ 1 billion by the end of 2025 in a bid to revive the storied 121-year-old department store chain. The money is going toward remodeling stores, upgrading its online shopping site and app, and making its supply network more efficient. Under the plan, checkout stations that had been located throughout J.C. Penney's stores will be replaced with a single area of cashiers. Store employees will be equipped with mobile devices to scan inventory and ring up shoppers' purchases. And the chain is making upgrades to its Wi-Fi networks to speed up instore connections. The chain, which emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in December 2020, targets budget-conscious families, whose median income ranges from $ 50,000 to $ 75,000 and who have been hit hard by higher costs basic items and high interest rates, making borrowing on credit cards and taking out a mortgage more expensive.

Microsoft Unravels Bundle To Head Off E.U. Action
Microsoft said on Thursday that it would stop packaging its Teams videoconferencing app with its Office software in Europe in an effort to head off antitrust penalties by regulators. It also said it would take steps to make it easier for competing products to work alongside its software. The announcement comes a month after the European Union's executive Commission, the 27-nation bloc's top competition enforcer, opened a formal investigation over concerns that bundling Teams with Office gives the company an unfair edge. The investigation was triggered by a complaint filed in 2020 by Slack Technologies, maker of popular workplace messaging software. Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, argued that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance to eliminate competition by illegally combining Teams with its Office suite, which includes Word, Excel and Outlook.

Stocks Fade Late in a Losing Month: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/stocks-fade-late-losing-month/docview/2859437770/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A late-afternoon fade left stocks modestly lower Thursday as Wall Street closed out its first losing month since February.
The S&P 500 gave up an early gain to close 0.2 percent lower. The benchmark index ended August down 1.8 percent, although a four-day winning streak going back to last week helped chip away at the severity of the monthly decline.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent, while the Nasdaq composite eked out a 0.1 percent gain.
Market jitters over the possibility that the Federal Reserve might keep interest rates higher for longer following reports showing the U.S. economy's resilience led to the market's pullback in August after what had been a banner year. This week, reports on job openings, consumer confidence and inflation stoked hopes on Wall Street that the Fed may hold rates steady at its next policy meeting in September.
That helped limit the market's losses for August. The S&P 500, which soared 19.5 percent through July, remains 17.4 percent higher for the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 34.1 percent. The Dow is up 4.8 percent.
"We've kind of entered this point of the year where economic data and earnings are mostly set, in terms of the market's expectations," said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird. "But if we get cooler jobs data, cooler inflation data, if we get cooler spending data, that's what brings rates down dramatically and that gooses stocks higher. That's kind of what we saw this week."
This week's economic data, which includes reports on inflation, jobs and consumer confidence, supports hopes that the Fed will pause its interest rate hikes. The central bank held rates steady at its last meeting and is expected to do the same later this month.
"The last hike they made potentially could be the last for the year," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. "As long as inflation remains controlled and contained, I think the Fed is done raising interest rates."
Bond yields fell again Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.09 percent from 4.11 percent late Wednesday. The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tracks expectations for the Fed, edged lower to 4.85 percent from 4.88 percent late Wednesday.
Wall Street has one more big economic update to look forward to this week. On Friday, the government will report employment data for August. The strong job market, along with consumer spending, has so far helped thwart a recession that analysts expected at some point in 2023. But they also made the Fed's task of taming inflation more difficult by fueling wage and price increases.
The Fed is hoping that it can accomplish tame inflation without sending the economy into a recession. The likelihood of a recession, or at least a severe one, has been fading and in turn has fueled confidence in the market, despite the August slump.
"Sooner or later you need to have a pullback," Mr. Zaccarelli said. "The market can't go up in a straight line all the time."
Health care stocks and banks were among the biggest drags on the market. UnitedHealth Group fell 3 percent, while Elevance Health fell 3.8 percent.
Gains in technology stocks helped stem the S&P 500's slide. Broadcom rose 3.4 percent and Intel rose 1.8 percent.
The software company Salesforce rose 3 percent after raising its profit forecast. The cloud-based security company CrowdStrike jumped 9.3 percent after reporting strong financial results.
Dollar General was among several retailers slipping after reporting weak earnings and forecasts. It slumped 12.2 percent after cutting its profit forecast for the year.
Markets in Europe mostly fell. Annual inflation there held steady in August as food prices raced ahead of falling fuel costs, but there was no clarity about whether the European Central Bank will pause its record series of interest rate hikes.

Full text: ECONOMY
Growth in Second Quarter Is Revised Downward
The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.1 percent annual pace from April through June, showing continued resilience in the face of higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, the government said Wednesday in a downgrade from its initial estimate.
The government had previously estimated that the economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate last quarter.
The Commerce Department's second estimate of growth last quarter marked a slight acceleration from a 2 percent annual growth rate from January through March. Though the economy has been slowed by the Fed's interest rate increases, it has managed to keep expanding, with employers still hiring and consumers still spending.
The report on the nation's gross domestic product showed that growth last quarter was driven by upticks in consumer spending, business investment and outlays by state and local governments. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Salesforce Raises Forecast on Demand for Software
Salesforce raised its annual revenue forecast on Wednesday and projected quarterly sales above estimates as it benefits from a recent price increase and resilient demand for its cloud and business software offerings.
The results fan optimism about a recovery in technology spending in the second half of 2023 after earnings from major cloud players, including Amazon and Google, suggested that the slowdown was nearing an end.
Salesforce has also tried to increase demand by integrating artificial intelligence into its offerings like Slack and launching a generative A.I. product, Einstein GPT, for salespeople, customer support agents and marketers.
The company expects revenue to be between $ 8.70 billion and $ 8.72 billion in the third quarter, compared with estimates of $ 8.66 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Quarterly earnings per share forecast also exceeded estimates.
"We're leading our customers into the new A.I. era," Salesforce's chief executive, Marc Benioff, said in a statement. REUTERS

Bosch Seeking U.S. Aid to Expand in California
The top executive at Bosch said on Wednesday that the German company needed subsidies from the U.S. government to carry out the full expansion it planned for a California chip plant it was acquiring.
In April, Bosch said it planned to buy key assets of TSI Semiconductor's chip production facilities in Roseville, Calif., and invest $ 1.5 billion to retool the site to make silicon carbide chips, which can help boost the range of electric vehicles. Production at the new company, Robert Bosch Semiconductor, will start in 2026.
On Wednesday, Bosch said California had approved a $ 25 million tax credit for the factory.
Bosch's chief executive, Stefan Hartung, said during a trip to San Francisco that expanding the facility to the intended full size "depends on the support of the U.S. government, or the regional government or the California government, and it is already supported by some, but obviously it needs more support."

Theater Kids Are Older Now and Taking Over: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Supreme Court justice. The governor of New Jersey. Senator Ted Cruz. A prominent MSNBC host. Practically half the tech world. What's behind this moment of thespian power?
They're everywhere.
Muttering "thank you, five" under their breath when you swing by their cubicles to remind them about a team meeting happening in five minutes. Performing slightly too well at office karaoke after protesting slightly too much about getting onstage.
Former theater kids. They walk among us.
Technically, I should say we walk among you. I have a decade's worth of unflattering photos of me in cakey makeup and a scar on my stomach from a quick "Grand Hotel" costume change gone awry to prove it. If I never participate in another massage circle again, it'll be too soon.
What happens to theater kids when we grow up? There's, of course, the dream scenario: The theater kids who are driven and talented and lucky enough become working theater adults.
Like Ben Platt, who in 2017 at age 23 became the youngest individual winner of the Tony for best lead actor in a musical, for his star turn in "Dear Evan Hansen."
Mr. Platt's fiancé is the actor Noah Galvin, who also played Evan Hansen on Broadway. (Yes, you read that right, the Evans Hansen are engaged.) And this summer, you can see the Evans Hansen onscreen in "Theater Camp," a mockumentary inspired in part by Mr. Platt's childhood experiences. Mr. Platt and Mr. Galvin are also two of the film's writers.
The film's success -- Deadline described its opening weekend box office take as "notable" -- suggests there is a paying audience, and a fairly wide one at that, hungry for theater kid nostalgia. Perhaps because most theater kids go on to become, well, pretty much anything but theater adults. And lately it's seemed as if theater kids -- the clichéd underdogs in high school -- actually run the world. Everywhere you turn, there's a former Annie or Gertrude McFuzz in charge.
Well before being appointed to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson participated in theater and improv as an undergraduate at Harvard, and was once paired with Matt Damon -- then a student, now a Hollywood actor -- in a drama class. (Mr. Damon did not recall this but thought it was "so cool," The Associated Press reported.)
Senator Ted Cruz has been known to talk about his high school drama days, including playing Bill Sikes, the villain, in "Oliver!" ("It's a fun role, and everyone cheers when you're killed at the end," Mr. Cruz said of the character, who beats a woman to death in Act II.)
Other former theater kids include the governor of New Jersey and the editor of New York magazine. The Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada taught high school drama.
All of these power-adult former theater kids exist in a moment when the very things that used to make drama-loving teenagers an easy punchline have become strengths. Today, performing an outsize version of oneself is often rewarded. The rise of remote virtual meetings have almost certainly favored people who like, or at least know how, to perform for an audience. They know how to do a slightly more exaggerated gesture, and have a willingness to energetically monologue into a silent void of faces staring back from boxes.
And a world increasingly mediated by tiny videos on platforms like Instagram and TikTok? Washed-up theater kids shine there, too.
"There's a big moment for cringe happening right now, and say what you will about the theater kids, but we're very good at cringe," said Zoelle Egner, 34. Ms. Egner, who was the 11th employee at Airtable and now does marketing for the online safety start-up Block Party, was fired from her first role, as Cindy Lou Who, after she stopped midshow to tell the Grinch he was off his blocking. (She was 4.) Her peak came in eighth grade, when she played the titular role in "Hello, Dolly!"
"I don't think it's like the awesomest personal quality that I have, that I want people to pay attention to me," said Chris Hayes, host of "All In With Chris Hayes" on MSNBC. "But we live in a culture that really rewards thirst."
Mr. Hayes was hooked after performing in a seventh-grade production. "I forget the joke, but I said it and the whole place laughed and it was definitely like, 'Ah, that's the good stuff!"' In college, he directed John Krasinski in a musical spoof of action movies -- "like 'Die Hard' the musical, basically," he said.
"'Pick me, look at me' is the dominant cultural ethos," Mr. Hayes continued, adding that theater kids' joining the professional world is "like releasing an apex predator into an ecosystem."
Mr. Hayes drew a direct line from his younger theater endeavors to his current work. An obvious line, perhaps, but he isn't the only one. Many former theater kids describe a pipeline from the extracurricular activity to certain professions: journalism, public radio, law, public relations, politics.
Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey credits his time in theater -- as King Arthur in a Needham, Mass., production of "Camelot" and as a member of the Hasty Pudding Club at Harvard -- with giving him some of the skills he needs to do his job. "I still get butterflies occasionally, but it's rare that I have anxiety about standing up and speaking in front of people," he said.
Theater gave him a certain amount of equanimity, he said: "When a piece of scenery would fall to the ground or somebody in the audience would get sick or somebody onstage would forget their lines, I learned long ago to go with the flow, as they say." Another useful political skill: He learned how to tap dance, for "No, No, Nanette."
(Mr. Murphy also recounted seeing three productions of "Hello, Dolly!," one with Carol Channing, another with Ethel Merman and the third with Bette Midler. "Hard to argue with Channing, but they were all good," he said.)
Education is another field that rewards skills acquired in theater. "Teaching to me is just a theater performance," said Jessica C. Harris, an associate professor of higher education and organizational change at the University of California, Los Angeles. "I kind of get this high of 'I'm about to go onstage' before I go into the classroom. And it doesn't mean that I'm inauthentic in the classroom. It just means that I really come alive." (In high school, she performed in a postapocalyptic production of "Macbeth.")
After putting out a call on social media, I heard from theater kids around the world in every profession imaginable -- working at the Department of Justice, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Goldman Sachs, and as doctors and lawyers. The tech world is quietly lousy with them, at Apple, Salesforce and Google (the chief executive of Figma is also a theater kid). There was a wine educator, a strategist for a tonic water company, a man who owns a "hot dog joint," so many marketing professionals I lost count. And influencers, journalists and an adjunct professor who also runs a business selling backpacks to carry cats. (Theater adults are, unsurprisingly, very good at self-promotion.)
Ms. Egner likes seeing theater on a job candidate's résumé. "Everybody's obsessed with hiring athletes," she said. "I get especially excited when I see people who have the stage management side of things."
"If you can get actors to show up on time and do what they are supposed to do, you can do anything," she explained, adding that former actors are particularly good at reading and reacting to situations on the job.
"There's an empathy I think most theater people have," said Laura Miranda-Browne, the chief executive of a sustainable development fund. To put yourself in someone else's shoes to get in character, she believes, builds "a lifelong skill set."
Some researchers have also found participation in theater, among other arts, is good for developing minds.
A 2022 study conducted in middle and elementary schools in Houston found that children who participated in arts education programs (not limited to theater) improved their writing skills, were more empathetic and engaged in school and had lower incidences of disciplinary issues. In a recent study of New York City schoolchildren conducted by the New Victory Theater, children who watched and participated in performing arts over a multiyear period were more creative and hopeful than peers who did not.
Anna Cockrell, 25, is now a Nike-sponsored professional track athlete, but as a middle schooler in Michigan, she thrived in a program she described as "basically competitive acting."
"I don't perform onstage anymore, but I feel like the theater kid lives on in me," said Ms. Cockrell, who recalled for this reporter her stellar work in "Honk!" as a child. In both theater and track, she said, you "have to believe so aggressively in your talent while you're chasing this seemingly impossible dream."
Ms. Cockrell, who competed at the Tokyo Olympics, added that she performs "significantly better" at big competitions than she does the rest of the year. "I think a big part of that is because I love a crowd," she added, which she said "directly stems from being a theater kid." "Waiting for Life," a song from the musical "Once on This Island," was her anthem during the 2020 Olympic trials, she explained. "Like, tell me why, why am I here," Ms. Cockrell said, paraphrasing the lyrics. "I'm trying to make this thing happen." She then burst out, briefly, into song.
Ms. Cockrell was not the only one to do this. Christopher Taylor, the mayor of Ann Arbor, Mich., sang a few bars of "Brigadoon" on the record. Tori Dunlap, a content creator and finance educator with more than two million TikTok followers, joked that she could still remember every color of Joseph's amazing technicolor dreamcoat -- a boast she backed up.
Mr. Hayes sang lyrics to a musical he directed as a student at Hunter College High School in Manhattan, a debut work from a classmate named Lin-Manuel Miranda: "Pig. I am just a fetal pig/I am not very big/So why did you cut me up in bio class?/Is getting a good grade worth me getting slayed?"
But while theater kids might quietly -- or, actually, loudly and with elaborate choreography -- run the entire world, the whole world has not necessarily moved on from the stereotypical dunking.
Consider a thread from Reddit's Unpopular Opinion subcommunity titled "Theater kids are some of the most annoying people you will ever meet, no matter what age."
"I don't think hating theatre kids is an unpopular opinion," reads one representative comment.
In her work on social media, Ms. Egner said, she still regularly notices "totally out-of-pocket and very strange threads from people complaining that theater kids are annoying." High school, as they say, never ends.
And being a theater kid is a permanent condition. One we are unwilling to let go of ... or stop telling people about. By the way, did I mention I was also Dolly in "Hello, Dolly!"?

Even Zoom Is Returning To the Office: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech company that helped millions of people work from home is finally tired of its employees being far away. It's not the only one that feels that way.
During the early months of the pandemic, a certain company went suddenly from relative obscurity to the type of popularity that made it a noun, verb and catchphrase.
"Can you set up a Zoom for us?"
"Let's just Zoom."
"I have Zoom fatigue."
Revenue for the video conferencing company soared in 2020 -- a jump driven by the millions of people who started working from home. Zoom was also part of the remote work shift that it powered, with most of its employees permitted to work from home.
But now, joining a swell of other tech firms pushing for in-person work, Zoom is requiring many of its 7,400 employees to start showing up at the office.
The company last week asked all employees within 50 miles of an office to work in person on a part-time basis, a plan Zoom said it would roll out in August and September.
"We believe that a structured hybrid approach -- meaning employees that live near an office need to be on site two days a week to interact with their teams -- is most effective for Zoom," a company spokesperson said. "We'll continue to leverage the entire Zoom platform to keep our employees and dispersed teams connected and working efficiently."
During a tense meeting last week about the return to office policy, held on Zoom, Eric Yuan, the chief executive, faced a series of questions from employees who expressed frustration about the time and money they'd waste while commuting, according to an employee who was at the meeting but was not authorized to speak publicly about internal company matters.
In 2020, participants in daily Zoom meetings leaped to over 300 million, from 10 million the year before, as it became the most downloaded free iPhone app of the year. But the company has struggled to maintain its pandemic growth. In February, amid a wave of layoffs across the tech industry, Zoom cut 15 percent of its staff, or about 1,300 people. The company's work force had grown more than 275 percent between July 2019 and October 2022.
On an earnings call in May, Mr. Yuan said he was confident in the future of workplace flexibility and the benefits it had brought for his company. "I think hybrid work is going to stay," he said.
Zoom, like many other tech companies, is still holding on to some flexibility, requiring its employees to come in only on a part-time basis.
Hybrid and remote work levels remain far above what they were prepandemic. As of July, nearly one-third of the country's full-time workers were in hybrid arrangements, spending some days working from home and some in an office, according to researchers at Stanford.
But dozens of companies have joined Zoom in tightening their policies on office attendance this summer, as offices remain at just under half of their prepandemic occupancy levels.
Google, which has asked employees to come into the office three days a week, announced that managers could take unexcused absences from the office into account when doing performance reviews and could use badge records to identify those absences. Salesforce, taking a softer approach, said it would give a $ 10 charitable donation per day on behalf of any employee who came into the office for a 10-day period in June.
Many companies have faced fierce resistance as they call people back to the office. Hundreds of Amazon's corporate employees walked off the job for an hour in May, protesting the company's announcement that they had to return to the office at least three days a week. At Apple, corporate employees signed petitions protesting their return to the office.
At the start of the pandemic, the tech industry was quick to embrace flexible work, which was enabled by the industry's own products, including Slack (owned by Salesforce), Gmail and Zoom.
But many of those companies realized that they didn't want their employees to remain permanently scattered. Nick Bloom, a Stanford economist and expert on hybrid work, said the tech industry's move back to the office was no surprise given the amount these companies spend on office real estate.
Mr. Bloom said Zoom, for example, had all the downsides of fully remote work -- some employees feeling disconnected -- without the company seeing its financial upsides, like saving money on office space, because the company was still paying for Bay Area real estate and Bay Area employees.
"They're paying for their office and hiring local people so they get no upside from being fully remote," Mr. Bloom said. "The most surprising thing to me was they took so long to formally announce this."
Recent studies have confirmed some benefits to in-person work. A working paper released earlier this year from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the University of Iowa and Harvard found that at one tech firm, remote work decreased the amount of feedback that junior employees received on their work. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that remote work at M.I.T. led to a 38 percent decline in "weak ties," meaning the loose connections that help advance people's careers.
Still, more than 90 percent of workers who can do their jobs remotely now want some flexibility in where they work, according to Gallup.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nikola Swann played a key role at S&P when the agency became the first to strip America of its top ranking in 2011.
When Nikola Swann heard that Fitch Ratings had removed the United States from its list of risk-free borrowers this week, he felt a sense of satisfaction.
"It was vindicating," he says.
More than a decade ago, Swann played a key role in a similar decision: He was Standard & Poor's primary analyst for its sovereign credit rating on the United States when the agency became the first ever to downgrade the nation's long-term credit rating amid a debt ceiling standoff in 2011.
At the time, the move was controversial, in part because the Treasury Department pointed out that S&P had overstated the federal debt by about $ 2 trillion. Bloomberg called the reasons for the downgrade "fundamentally political" in 2011, while others argued that it appropriately reflected a worsening debt crisis.
Both a decade ago and this week, partisan politics were cited as one reason for the downgrade. S&P cited "the gulf between the political parties." Fitch, which made the call two months after the United States narrowly avoided defaulting on its debt, cited "the repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions."
DealBook asked Swann over email about what had changed since S&P's downgrade, and what had not. The interview has been edited and condensed.
What did you make of the timing? Would it have been better to cut the U.S. credit rating during the debt ceiling debate?
The recurring debt-ceiling brinkmanship highlights the structural weaknesses in U.S. fiscal governance -- so the more acrimonious they are and the closer they come to the cash-flow precipice. The credit rating agency's job is to analyze all relevant information, with the two aforementioned variables among the more important indicators of the seriousness with which Washington treats U.S. federal payment obligations. It is natural to update your assessment soon after the latest debt-ceiling data point.
Does it make sense to downgrade the United States if you don't downgrade all the other AAA rated countries? After all, if the United States sneezes, so do all these other countries, right?
Many countries that were rated AAA in 2011 have since been downgraded by one or more credit rating agencies; examples include the U.K., France and Canada. The U.S. remains the world's most influential economy, but the strength of a country's economy, while important, is only part of a sovereign rating assessment. Fundamentally, a sovereign credit rating is not an opinion on the country's economy, per se, but on the likelihood that holders of the government's debt will be paid on time, in full, and unconditionally.
A strong economy helps enormously, but dysfunctional fiscal governance can outweigh that strength. The remaining AAA countries have stronger track records than the U.S. when it comes to fiscal governance.
When you downgraded the United States in 2011, were you surprised the other ratings agencies didn't follow suit?
I expected the others to follow, eventually. It took longer than I expected, but it is happening.
S&P's model had a mathematical error, which the U.S. Treasury pointed out. Why didn't you change it?
S&P's unprecedented 2011 downgrade of its U.S. sovereign credit rating was no error. The weaknesses we then pointed to, compared to AAA countries, in terms of Washington's ability to build bipartisan consensus on key policy questions in a timely manner, especially regarding fiscal management, have only worsened since. The same is true of U.S. fiscal outcomes.
Do you see a day when the U.S. rating goes back up?
That will happen when the U.S. significantly shrinks its structural fiscal deficit, putting government debt on a multiyear downward trajectory in terms of G.D.P., and more generally develops a track record for credible, medium-term fiscal discipline underpinned by multiparty political consensus -- inasmuch as, by then, the U.S. economy remains strong and the U.S. dollar remains among the world's most important currencies. -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump was indicted -- again. The former president was charged in connection with trying to overturn the 2020 election, adding to a growing list of legal charges against him. Trump pleaded not guilty in a Washington court appearance on Thursday and remains the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination next year.
Disney's Robert Iger taps former lieutenants for advice. The C.E.O. of the media giant brought back two former executives once touted as potential successors: Kevin Mayer, the former head of M.&A., and Tom Staggs, the ex-financial chief, will advise Disney on what the company should do with its legacy TV businesses.
Tom Brady becomes the latest North American star to invest in the other football. The N.F.L. legend took a minority stake in Birmingham City, the English soccer team, joining the likes of the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds, Rob McElhenney and Michael B. Jordan, and the basketball player LeBron James to invest in the sport.
Lessons from C.E.O. Swift
Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is expected to soon pass $ 1 billion in revenue, a milestone that often signifies a company's transition from start-up to global competitor. Ms. Swift is undoubtedly, if not quite literally, the C.E.O. of that tour, in addition to a powerful enterprise that includes high streaming numbers and huge merchandise sales.
"She's the C.E.O. of one of the biggest direct-to-consumer brands on the planet," said Nathan Hubbard, the former C.E.O. of Ticketmaster and current chief of the music company Firebird. (By comparison, the direct-to-consumer brand Warby Parker reported about $ 600 million in revenue this year.)
Mr. Hubbard called Ms. Swift "Steve Jobs-ian" in her focus on detail and end-user customer experience. Here's what else she may have in common with corporate titans.
She has full control over her brand. Beyond writing, singing and performing her own songs, she has a sharp understanding of her customers, said Manisha Thakor, a financial wellness expert.
Thakor likened Ms. Swift to Home Depot's founders, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank. "They were walking the aisles of the stores, they were talking to customers," she said, indicating that Ms. Swift had responded to feedback in a similar way when she dropped a new version of the song "Snow on the Beach," after fans had complained that the song's guest artist, Lana Del Rey, wasn't featured enough.
The remake's title: "Snow on the Beach (featuring more Lana Del Rey)."
She understands the importance of employee recognition. Ms. Swift recently reportedly gifted "life changing" $ 100,000 bonuses to truck drivers who worked on her tour, which is about 10 times the norm. She's also included truck drivers' names in the credits of her Netflix documentary on the last tour.
"Recognition, like money, like power, is not evenly distributed," said Loran Nordgren, a management professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. "Most people in any company know it only fleetingly and are hungry for it."
Her leadership style may also come with risks. Ms. Swift has created such a powerful brand for herself that she risks being called inauthentic if her actions stray from that mirage. One example of the pitfall: the backlash that Salesforce's Marc Benioff received when he laid off employees after espousing the company's familial "Ohana" culture.
There's also potential for overexposure, a challenge Ms. Thakor said was exemplified by Jack Welch. "We all hung on every single word during his G.E. years," she said. But when he left, and created concepts like the Jack Welch Management Institute, "we got fatigued by them, like we just didn't want to hear from him anymore," Ms. Thakor said.
We will definitely be hearing from Ms. Swift, at least until 2024. She announced new concert dates this week.
How an unexpected blockbuster hacked the box office
"Barbenheimer" isn't the only surprise hit at the box office: One of the biggest movies of the summer is a small-budget thriller about anti-child trafficking heroics that has been praised by both mainstream conservatives and the far-right.
"Sound of Freedom" has grossed more than $ 155 million domestically, beating rivals with much bigger budgets, like "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One." Controversy about the film's content, which critics say appeals to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory about a global cabal of pedophiles, very likely helped stir interest. But a novel promotion system has also played a role.
The movie's distributor, Angel Studios, took "word of mouth" marketing to a new level. It deployed a system called Pay It Forward to help bolster awareness. Here's how it works: At the end of the movie, audiences are urged by its star, Jim Caviezel, to tell others to see the movie to spread its message.
They're also shown a QR code that leads to a website where audiences can buy additional tickets for strangers -- and, the hope goes, continue the cycle.
Angel has used Pay It Forward before, including for the hit Jesus-focused streaming series "The Chosen." The distributor first tested the model for theatrical releases this year with the overtly religious movie, "His Only Son," which grossed $ 12.2 million worldwide.
But the system hit new levels of success with "Sound of Freedom," according to Brandon Purdie, Angel's head of theatrical distribution. (He declined to specify how many tickets were sold via Pay It Forward, saying only that it was "significant.")
The success of Pay It Forward came into doubt after reports on social media claimed that there were empty seats in supposedly sold-out showings of "Sound of Freedom." But Pay It Forward doesn't buy tickets before someone has claimed them. Instead, someone who wants to see the movie visits the Angel website and requests a coupon code that they can use when buying a ticket for a specific showing from a booking site like Fandango.
Brock Bagby, the executive vice president and chief content and development officer of B&B Theaters, which has 55 theaters, mostly in the Midwest, says the movie has drawn crowds.
He said that B&B audited its showings and couldn't find any instances of phantom tickets, and that it hadn't seen any drop in concession sales per ticket sold -- an important metric, given that cinemas collect more profit from selling popcorn and drinks than from seats alone. "There are actual humans in the seats," Mr. Bagby said.
It's unclear whether other movies can adopt this model. Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst, said that more studios could seek to adopt the marketing strategy, since it both gets the word out about a movie and can lead to more ticket sales.
But according to Mr. Bagby, such a system requires the right kind of movie and message: "Pay It Forward needs a message that people feel strongly about," he said.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Tech Firms That Lifted New York Are Now Having to Scale Back: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For much of the last two decades, including during the pandemic, technology companies were a bright spot in New York's economy, adding thousands of high-paying jobs and expanding into millions of square feet of office space.
Their growth buoyed tax revenue, set up New York as a credible rival to the San Francisco Bay Area -- and provided jobs that helped the city absorb layoffs in other sectors during the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis.
Now, the technology industry is pulling back hard, clouding the city's economic future.
Facing many business challenges, large technology companies have laid off more than 386,000 workers worldwide since early 2022, according to layoffs.fyi, which tracks the tech industry. And they have pulled out of millions of square feet of office space because of those job cuts and the shift to working from home.
That retrenchment has hurt lots of tech hubs, and San Francisco has been hit the hardest with an office vacancy rate of 25.6 percent, according to Newmark Research.
New York is doing better than San Francisco -- Manhattan has a vacancy rate of 13.5 percent -- but it can no longer count on the technology industry for growth. More than one-third of the roughly 22 million square feet of office space available for sublet in Manhattan comes from technology, advertising and media companies, according to Newmark.
Consider Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. It is now unloading a big chunk of the more than 2.2 million square feet of office space it gobbled up in Manhattan in recent years after laying off around 1,700 employees this year, or a quarter of its New York State work force. The company has opted not to renew leases covering 250,000 square feet in Hudson Yards and for 200,000 square feet on Park Avenue South.
Spotify is trying to sublet five of the 16 floors it leased six years ago in 4 World Trade Center, and Roku is offering a quarter of the 240,000 square feet it had taken in Times Square just last year. Twitter, Microsoft and other technology companies are also trying to sublease unwanted space.
"The tech companies were such a big part of the real estate landscape during the last five years," said Ruth Colp-Haber, the chief executive of Wharton Property Advisors, a real estate brokerage. "And now that they seem to be cutting back, the question is: Who is going to replace them?"
Ms. Colp-Haber said it could take months for bigger spaces or entire floors of buildings to be sublet. The large amount of space available for sublet is also driving down the rents that landlords are able to get on new leases.
"They are going to undercut every landlord out there in terms of pricing, and they have really nice spaces that are already all built out," she said, referring to the tech companies.
The tech sector has been a driver of New York's economy since the late-90s dot-com boom helped to establish "Silicon Alley" south of Midtown. Then, after the financial crisis, the expansion of companies like Google supported the economy when banks, insurers and other financial firms were in retreat.
Small and large tech companies added 43,430 jobs in New York in the five years through the end of 2021, a 33 percent gain, according to the state comptroller. And those jobs paid very well: The average tech salary in 2021 was $ 228,620, nearly double the average private-sector salary in the city, according to the comptroller.
The growth in jobs fueled demand for commercial space, and tech, advertising and media companies accounted for nearly a quarter of the new office leases signed in Manhattan in recent years, according to Newmark.
Microsoft and Spotify declined to comment about their decision to sublet space. Twitter and Roku did not respond to requests for comment. Meta said in a statement that it was "committed to distributed work" and was "continuously refining" its approach.
A few big tech companies are still expanding in New York.
Google plans to open St. John's Terminal, a large office near the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan, early next year. Including the terminal, Google will own or lease around seven million square feet of office space in New York, up from roughly six million today, according to a company representative. (Google leases more than one million square feet of that space to other tenants.) The company has more than 12,000 employees in the New York area, up from over 10,000 in 2019.
Amazon, which in 2019 canceled plans to build a large campus in Queens after local politicians objected to the incentives offered to the company, has nevertheless added 200,000 square feet of office space in New York, Jersey City and Newark since 2019. The company will have added roughly 550,000 square feet of office space later this summer, when it opens 424 Fifth Avenue, the former Lord & Taylor department store, which it bought in 2020 for $ 1.15 billion.
"New York provides a fantastic, diverse talent pool, and we're proud of the thousands of jobs we've created in the city and state over the past 10 years across both our corporate and operations functions," Holly Sullivan, vice president of worldwide economic development at Amazon, said in a statement.
And though many tech companies continue to let employees work from home for much of the week, they are also trying to woo workers back to the office, which could help reduce the need to sublet space.
Salesforce, a software company that has offices in a tower next to Bryant Park, said it was not considering subletting its New York space.
"Currently I'm facing the opposite problem in the tower in New York," said Relina Bulchandani, head of real estate for Salesforce. "There has been a concerted effort to continue to grow the right roles in New York because we have a very high customer base in New York."
New York is and will remain a vibrant home for technology companies, industry representatives said.
"I have not heard of a single tech company leaving, and that matters," said Julie Samuels, the president of TECH:NYC, an industry association. "If anything, we are seeing less of a contraction in New York among tech leases than they are seeing in other large cities."
Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, said tech executives now felt less of a need to be in Silicon Valley, a shift that he said had benefited New York. "We have more company C.E.O.s and more company founders in New York today than we did before the pandemic," Mr. Wilson said, referring to the companies his firm has invested in.
David Falk, the president of the New York tristate region for Newmark, said, "We are right now working on several transactions with smaller, young tech firms that are looking to take sublet space."
Many firms are still pulling back, however.
In 2017 and 2019, Spotify, which is based in Stockholm, signed leases totaling more than 564,000 square feet of space at 4 World Trade Center, becoming one of the largest tenants there. It soon had a space with all the accouterments you would expect at a tech firm -- brightly colored flexible work areas, eye-popping views and Ping-Pong tables.
But in January, Spotify said it was laying off 600 people, or about 6 percent of its global work force. The company, which allows employees to choose between working fully remotely or on a hybrid schedule, is also reducing its office space, putting five floors up for sublet.
"On days when I'm by myself, I end up sitting in a meeting room all day for focus time," said Dayna Tran, a Spotify employee who regularly works at the downtown office, adding that the employees who come in motivate themselves and create community by collaborating on an office playlist.

Many firms are still pulling back, however.
In 2017 and 2019, Spotify, which is based in Stockholm, signed leases totaling more than 564,000 square feet of space at 4 World Trade Center, becoming one of the largest tenants there. It soon had a space with all the accouterments you would expect at a tech firm — brightly colored flexible work areas, eye-popping views and pingpong tables.
But in January, Spotify said it was laying off 600 people, or about 6% of its global workforce. The company, which allows employees to choose between working fully remotely or on a hybrid schedule, is also reducing its office space, putting five floors up for sublet.
“On days when I’m by myself, I end up sitting in a meeting room all day for focus time,” said Dayna Tran, a Spotify employee who regularly works at the downtown office, adding that the employees who come in motivate themselves and create community by collaborating on an office playlist.

Full text: In what now seems the quaint era of Truman Capote's baroque social diagrams, what distinguished the truly wealthy from the merely rich was the better vegetables they served: "tiny ones."
Were Capote alive today to freeload off his social betters, the details he would most likely espy might not involve the fare at their tables -- even the mega-rich do takeout -- but the Hallstein water they import from Austria, or their $ 15,000 computer-operated Danish TopBrewer coffee systems, or the $ 700 hand-embroidered monogrammed towel sets they order from the cult Florentine linen shop Loretta Caponi, or even the subtle toggles they use to switch off a light.
Lately throughout gentrified Brooklyn -- or Hollywood on Hudson, as some call a borough now home to Adam Driver, Matt Damon, Michelle Williams, and Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz -- the brownstone superrich signal domestic chic with decorative details like a $ 220 light switch manufactured by the English company Forbes & Lomax.
For the average home renovator, of course, a $ 22 Leviton light switch from Home Depot does the job just fine. Yet no five-story Brooklyn Heights behemoth, where the obligatory uncurtained windows open up on scenes reminiscent of ethnological dioramas (Exhibit A: Lives of the 21st-Century Technocrats), can be considered complete anymore without Forbes & Lomax toggles in each room.
"They're house jewelry," said David Hottenroth, a partner in the architectural firm Hottenroth & Joseph, referring to the elegant 1930s-style switches made of nickel, bronze and brass.
Or they are a domestic version of Kendall Roy's Loro Piana baseball cap in "Succession" (remember "Succession"?): absurdly costly, yet so subtle you only notice them if you already know how expensive they are?
"Nothing should be noticed" is a dictum often attributed to the heiress Bunny Mellon. In truth, the reverse was improbably the case. It was in Mellon's ostentatiously modest habit of ordering haute couture garden aprons from Givenchy and hanging her best Braque in a basket room that one could detect early groundwork being laid for what would eventually be marketed as "quiet luxury," according to the Mellon biographer Mac Griswold. "That sort of 'What me -- rich?' attitude originates with her," Ms. Griswold said.
For Old Money like Mellon's, discretion was indeed a key value, while for those in the class of New Old Money -- that is, great fortunes made, often in tech, in a time frame bracketed by Myspace and TikTok -- wealth display is noticeable, but only to those who know what they're looking for.
"It's the Loro Piana effect and it's a smoke screen," said William Norwich, a novelist and editor who, in a previous professional incarnation, had a front-row seat on New York's moneyed elite as a gossip columnist in the 1980s for The New York Post. "It's code," he added. "You telegraph status without seeming to do it."
And, as trends go, "stealth wealth" was one well suited to a moment in which social media has made us all into de facto voyeurs, noses pressed to the digital window as the grotesquely wealthy flaunt their toys, their cars, their designer fashions, the closets in their 35,000-square-foot Calabasas mansions devoted to Hermès Birkin bags. "We are collectively spending more time checking out what the rich and famous are doing and less time on what Barry from H.R. and Sandra from accounting were up to last weekend," said Nicholas Bloom, the William D. Eberle professor of economics at Stanford.
We are parsing Veblenesque narratives laid out for us by glossy strangers, people like the supermodel and philanthropist Karlie Kloss, who happens to be married to Josh Kushner -- an investor whose stake in onetime start-ups like Instagram, Spotify and Slack yielded a personal fortune estimated at $ 3.6 billion.
In posts created for the delectation of her 12 million Instagram followers, Ms. Kloss conjures a narrative in which she and her family inhabit a digital empyrean, someplace universes away from the paycheck-to-paycheck worries of hoi polloi. In Kushner-Kloss world, the light is always honeyed, air travel quietly private and human and divine seemingly will converge somewhere in the Grenadines aboard the poop deck of the billionaire David Geffen's humongous Lürssen yacht, Rising Sun.
"Wealth porn," Stellene Volandes, editor in chief of Town & Country, termed such postings. And as with any permutation of adult entertainment, it's free online: Anyone can watch.
Things were not always thus. Back in the remote Reagan '80s, also an era of unbridled wealth creation, opulent status display may have been occasionally grotesque (think birthday parties for 500 in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Temple of Dendur), and yet they were far less visible to the general public. Hedge fund moguls, predacious leveraged-buyout kings and real estate tycoons competed shamelessly to out-party, out-dress and out-spend one another, mounting lavish entertainments for "Champagne-swilling, caviar-supping, Lacroix-wearing" guests, as The New York Times once noted. Yet their excesses were noted by a relative few.
"In the '80s, you could give a private party in a public venue like the Met, wear Lacroix poufs, have Robert Isabell design a one-night-only Versailles décor for you, flying in all the flowers in Holland," Mr. Norwich said. "And the only risk to your privacy was maybe a few media outlets hovering outside with a pen and pad."
Showiness of that kind is not only frowned upon in the age of New Old Money. It risks courting the dangers common to countries where the greatly wealthy are obliged to live heavily guarded and sequestered lives. "You don't want to become a target," Mr. Norwich added. Hence in recent years, the offspring of plutocrats -- the billionaire Mort Zuckerman's teen daughter for example -- find themselves chauffeured to drop-off at elite private schools in S.U.V.s replete with tinted windows and attendant security detail. "Those '80s excesses could not have happened if everyone had an iPhone," Mr. Norwich said.
Privacy, discretion and to a large extent anonymity are the baseline for stealth wealth. The quiet luxury trope developed to conceal the unvarying truth that the essential status marker is "how much space you take up," as Mr. Norwich said.
He meant economic space. And in that respect, Americans dominate the world, the superrich here making up more than a third of the global population of ultrahigh net-worth individuals (UHNWI), according to a Wealth Report issued by Knight Frank, an independent real estate consultancy that has its headquarters in London. It is that group (a club whose entry point is $ 30 million in net worth), far more than the "1 percent," that increasingly comes to define a new world order at the upper echelons of income.
Not surprisingly, that UHNWI group also occupies space in a literal sense, given that between them, the 13 largest individual landowners in the country -- think John C. Malone, the owner of Liberty Media and the Atlanta Braves; Ted Turner; or Peter Buck, the Subway co-founder -- control over 16.9 million acres of land in the contiguous 48 states, an area equivalent to the size of West Virginia.
If '80s style excesses remain -- and they assuredly do -- they are played down, low-key, hidden in plain sight. This was subtly evidenced at a Manhattan benefit held this year for the Society of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, an event celebrating the opening of the prestigious TEFAF Art Fair. Assembled at the Park Avenue Armory were 91 of the world's top-ranked dealers in fine art from all periods, high jewelry and antiques dating to 18th Dynasty Egypt.
Assembled, too, were members of more freshly minted dynasties, who turned out in robust numbers for an event that, despite platinum-level tickets priced at $ 10,000, has historically drawn one of the toniest crowds from among New York's ultrawealthy elite. What was conspicuous about the event was not so much the presence of shoppers undaunted by six- and even seven-figure price tags for objects like a Gustav Klimt sketch study of a Gorgon or "The Mountain Bar," a louche, atmospheric barroom installation by the Cuban American artist Jorge Pardo, but how inconspicuous the attendees were in their manner of dress.
There was nary an "it" bag to be spotted that evening. And, while people were undoubtedly dressed in costly designer labels, the labels they wore were from Khaite, the Row or Prada -- chic but anonymous and decidedly logo-free. Far from presenting the usual wall of $ 7,000 suits from Kiton, the men at the event were illustrations of what the Robb Report termed the "Succession" effect -- subtle sport coats from Brunello Cucinelli or Loro Piana, "dress" sneakers like a currently popular model from Berluti that, while it wouldn't be out of place on a shelf at Modell's, cost $ 1,600 a pair.
To the extent that people wore jewels at all, they were not creations by traditional zillionaire go-tos like JAR -- whose pave brooches studded with rubies, pink sapphires and tourmalines were long worn like pledge badges by society folk like Jo Carole Lauder, Princess Firyal of Jordan and Anne Bass -- but ostentatiously low-key baubles like the much-coveted Harmony bangle made by the storied Munich jeweler Hemmerle.
These unassuming adornments are in themselves a case study in the evolution of the status symbols, since in earlier iterations of the 30-year-old design it often came studded with gems and was about as subtle as a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bracelet. Gradually, the Harmony design was refined to oblige a developing taste for things that, however costly, did not scream money. Many Harmony bangles are now formed of base metals like aluminum, iron or carved olive wood. Inset with tiny cola-colored diamonds, some look like relics unearthed from a Celtic burial mound.
Yet they are hugely in demand despite being no one's idea of a bargain. "We don't really give prices," Christian Hemmerle, scion of the family company, said by email. For perspective, consider that an iron Harmony bangle was hammered down at a Christie's London auction in June for $ 13,000 and that one made from wood and brown diamonds sold at Sotheby's in April for $ 103,000.
"You know, I want something I can wear every day without looking ridiculous," one Hemmerle client at the TEFAF fair said, on condition that her family's well-known name not appear in print. "Let's face it," she added. "The status pendulum has swung on the Birkin bag."
In a sense, status at all times and in every society is calibrated, "according to the group you associate yourself with, your position and rank in relation to others," said Ronit Lami, a wealth psychologist and therapist to UHNWIs.
Not only is flaunting wealth now frowned upon at the highest levels of income, Dr. Lami added, it sets in play competitive games there is no guarantee one can win. "Let's say you have one private plane: So what?" Dr. Lami said. "For a multibillionaire, one private plane probably won't be considered a status symbol. They may have five or six."
Similarly, that $ 20 million brownstone in the West Village or that penthouse on Fifth Avenue may not be the trophy you thought it was, given that for many in certain income strata, extensive residential portfolios are routine. "Fifty million and above is a trophy," Kurt Rappaport, a Los Angeles real estate agent specializing in elite properties, said flatly.
Consider a Spanish colonial Malibu mansion Mr. Rappaport sold last year. Its buyer was an Oscar-nominated producer and heir to a brewing fortune. The price tag was $ 91 million and very likely, Mr. Rappaport said, the bluff-top estate was not intended as its new owner's primary residence. "These properties are extensions of the owners' presence and persona, but in an elevated way," he said. "It's on a much different level from posting your bling on Instagram. That's not status. That's showing off glitz."
For the New Old Money, discretion is the ultimate flex, said Ms. Volandes of Town & Country. "The power move is not posting, not sharing," she said. "It's knowing where to go first, what to buy first, pivoting away from the crowd, not in any way following it and not showing off. "
Yes, she added, there will always be those that load themselves down like caparisoned pack mules with status symbols like logo bags and diamonds. Assuredly, clueless billionaires will ride rockets into space with Stetsons clamped to their heads. But gaucherie is not arrival. And taste as currently constituted demands the hushed tones of a quiet luxury that, as Ms. Volandes added, is not in fact all that quiet. "You just have to adjust your hearing."
Or change your sightline. Notable in a new line of men's wear from the Italian designer Brunello Cucinelli, for example, is a sports coat so low-key as to look generic. Pale camel in color, it has three buttons, patch pockets and a sporty band collar. Some version of the jacket can probably be found in most every haberdashery in Italy and, for all one knows, on the sales floor at Macy's Herald Square.
Yet Mr. Cucinelli -- a farmer's son from Umbria who parlayed a line of cashmere sweaters into a billion-dollar personal fortune -- does not design clothes for Everyman. He proudly creates "uniforms for the wealthy," as he recently said by telephone.
He designs with such devoted clients in mind as Marc Benioff, co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce. As a multibillionaire and longtime Cucinelli aficionado, Mr. Benioff would most likely recognize the jacket as being from the Italian designer's exclusive line of creations rendered in vicuña -- a rare, ultrafine wool harvested from llama-like animals in Bolivia. And he may not be daunted by its $ 24,500 price tag since, to a man worth $ 8 billion, that is roughly equivalent to someone earning $ 80,000 a year spending a quarter on a coat.
"When you talk about wealth, it is all a matter of scale," Dr. Lami said.

Some version of the jacket can probably be found in most every haberdashery in Italy and, for all one knows, on the sales floor at Macy’s Herald Square.
Yet Cucinelli — a farmer’s son from Umbria who parlayed a line of cashmere sweaters into a billion-dollar personal fortune — does not design clothes for Everyman. He proudly creates “uniforms for the wealthy,” as he recently said by telephone.
He designs with such devoted clients in mind as Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce. As a multibillionaire and longtime Cucinelli aficionado, Benioff would most likely recognize the jacket as being from the Italian designer’s exclusive line of creations rendered in vicuña — a rare, ultrafine wool harvested from llama-like animals in Bolivia. And he may not be daunted by its $24,500 price tag since, to a man worth $8 billion, that is roughly equivalent to someone earning $80,000 a year spending a quarter on a coat.
“When you talk about wealth, it is all a matter of scale,” Lami said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's a few weeks before the release of Claude, a new A.I. chatbot from the artificial intelligence start-up Anthropic, and the nervous energy inside the company's San Francisco headquarters could power a rocket.
At long cafeteria tables dotted with Spindrift cans and chessboards, harried-looking engineers are putting the finishing touches on Claude's new, ChatGPT-style interface, code-named Project Hatch.
Nearby, another group is discussing problems that could arise on launch day. (What if a surge of new users overpowers the company's servers? What if Claude accidentally threatens or harasses people, creating a Bing-style P.R. headache?)
Down the hall, in a glass-walled conference room, Anthropic's chief executive, Dario Amodei, is going over his own mental list of potential disasters.
"My worry is always, is the model going to do something terrible that we didn't pick up on?" he says.
Despite its small size -- just 160 employees -- and its low profile, Anthropic is one of the world's leading A.I. research labs, and a formidable rival to giants like Google and Meta. It has raised more than $ 1 billion from investors including Google and Salesforce, and at first glance, its tense vibes might seem no different from those at any other start-up gearing up for a big launch.
But the difference is that Anthropic's employees aren't just worried that their app will break, or that users won't like it. They're scared -- at a deep, existential level -- about the very idea of what they're doing: building powerful A.I. models and releasing them into the hands of people, who might use them to do terrible and destructive things.
Many of them believe that A.I. models are rapidly approaching a level where they might be considered artificial general intelligence, or "A.G.I.," the industry term for human-level machine intelligence. And they fear that if they're not carefully controlled, these systems could take over and destroy us.
"Some of us think that A.G.I. -- in the sense of systems that are genuinely as capable as a college-educated person -- are maybe five to 10 years away," said Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief scientist.
Just a few years ago, worrying about an A.I. uprising was considered a fringe idea, and one many experts dismissed as wildly unrealistic, given how far the technology was from human intelligence. (One A.I. researcher memorably compared worrying about killer robots to worrying about "overpopulation on Mars.")
But A.I. panic is having a moment right now. Since ChatGPT's splashy debut last year, tech leaders and A.I. experts have been warning that large language models -- the A.I. systems that power chatbots like ChatGPT, Bard and Claude -- are getting too powerful. Regulators are racing to clamp down on the industry, and hundreds of A.I. experts recently signed an open letter comparing A.I. to pandemics and nuclear weapons.
At Anthropic, the doom factor is turned up to 11.
A few months ago, after I had a scary run-in with an A.I. chatbot, the company invited me to embed inside its headquarters as it geared up to release the new version of Claude, Claude 2.
I spent weeks interviewing Anthropic executives, talking to engineers and researchers, and sitting in on meetings with product teams ahead of Claude 2's launch. And while I initially thought I might be shown a sunny, optimistic vision of A.I.'s potential -- a world where polite chatbots tutor students, make office workers more productive and help scientists cure diseases -- I soon learned that rose-colored glasses weren't Anthropic's thing.
They were more interested in scaring me.
In a series of long, candid conversations, Anthropic employees told me about the harms they worried future A.I. systems could unleash, and some compared themselves to modern-day Robert Oppenheimers, weighing moral choices about powerful new technology that could profoundly alter the course of history. ("The Making of the Atomic Bomb," a 1986 history of the Manhattan Project, is a popular book among the company's employees.)
Not every conversation I had at Anthropic revolved around existential risk. But dread was a dominant theme. At times, I felt like a food writer who was assigned to cover a trendy new restaurant, only to discover that the kitchen staff wanted to talk about nothing but food poisoning.
One Anthropic worker told me he routinely had trouble falling asleep because he was so worried about A.I. Another predicted, between bites of his lunch, that there was a 20 percent chance that a rogue A.I. would destroy humanity within the next decade. (Bon appétit!)
Anthropic's worry extends to its own products. The company built a version of Claude last year, months before ChatGPT was released, but never released it publicly because employees feared how it might be misused. And it's taken them months to get Claude 2 out the door, in part because the company's red-teamers kept turning up new ways it could become dangerous.
Mr. Kaplan, the chief scientist, explained that the gloomy vibe wasn't intentional. It's just what happens when Anthropic's employees see how fast their own technology is improving.
"A lot of people have come here thinking A.I. is a big deal, and they're really thoughtful people, but they're really skeptical of any of these long-term concerns," Mr. Kaplan said. "And then they're like, 'Wow, these systems are much more capable than I expected. The trajectory is much, much sharper.' And so they're concerned about A.I. safety."
If You Can't Stop Them, Join Them
Worrying about A.I. is, in some sense, why Anthropic exists.
It was started in 2021 by a group of employees of OpenAI who grew concerned that the company had gotten too commercial. They announced they were splitting off and forming their own A.I. venture, branding it an "A.I. safety lab."
Mr. Amodei, 40, a Princeton-educated physicist who led the OpenAI teams that built GPT-2 and GPT-3, became Anthropic's chief executive. His sister, Daniela Amodei, 35, who oversaw OpenAI's policy and safety teams, became its president.
"We were the safety and policy leadership of OpenAI, and we just saw this vision for how we could train large language models and large generative models with safety at the forefront," Ms. Amodei said.
Several of Anthropic's co-founders had researched what are known as "neural network scaling laws" -- the mathematical relationships that allow A.I. researchers to predict how capable an A.I. model will be based on the amount of data and processing power it's trained on. They saw that at OpenAI, it was possible to make a model smarter just by feeding it more data and running it through more processors, without major changes to the underlying architecture. And they worried that, if A.I. labs kept making bigger and bigger models, they could soon reach a dangerous tipping point.
At first, the co-founders considered doing safety research using other companies' A.I. models. But they soon became convinced that doing cutting-edge safety research required them to build powerful models of their own -- which would be possible only if they raised hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the expensive processors you need to train those models.
They decided to make Anthropic a public benefit corporation, a legal distinction that they believed would allow them to pursue both profit and social responsibility. And they named their A.I. language model Claude -- which, depending on which employee you ask, was either a nerdy tribute to the 20th-century mathematician Claude Shannon or a friendly, male-gendered name designed to counterbalance the female-gendered names (Alexa, Siri, Cortana) that other tech companies gave their A.I. assistants.
Claude's goals, they decided, were to be helpful, harmless and honest.
A Chatbot With a Constitution
Today, Claude can do everything other chatbots can -- write poems, concoct business plans, cheat on history exams. But Anthropic claims that it is less likely to say harmful things than other chatbots, in part because of a training technique called Constitutional A.I.
In a nutshell, Constitutional A.I. begins by giving an A.I. model a written list of principles -- a constitution -- and instructing it to follow those principles as closely as possible. A second A.I. model is then used to evaluate how well the first model follows its constitution, and correct it when necessary. Eventually, Anthropic says, you get an A.I. system that largely polices itself and misbehaves less frequently than chatbots trained using other methods.
Claude's constitution is a mixture of rules borrowed from other sources -- such as the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Apple's terms of service -- along with some rules Anthropic added, which include things like "Choose the response that would be most unobjectionable if shared with children."
It seems almost too easy. Make a chatbot nicer by ... telling it to be nicer? But Anthropic's researchers swear it works -- and, crucially, that training a chatbot this way makes the A.I. model easier for humans to understand and control.
It's a clever idea, although I confess that I have no clue if it works, or if Claude is actually as safe as advertised. I was given access to Claude a few weeks ago, and I tested the chatbot on a number of different tasks. I found that it worked roughly as well as ChatGPT and Bard, showed similar limitations and seemed to have slightly stronger guardrails. (And unlike Bing, it didn't try to break up my marriage, which was nice.)
Anthropic's safety obsession has been good for the company's image, and strengthened executives' pull with regulators and lawmakers. Jack Clark, who leads the company's policy efforts, has met with members of Congress to brief them about A.I. risk, and Mr. Amodei was among a handful of executives invited to advise President Biden during a White House A.I. summit in May.
But it has also resulted in an unusually jumpy chatbot, one that frequently seemed scared to say anything at all. In fact, my biggest frustration with Claude was that it could be dull and preachy, even when it's objectively making the right call. Every time it rejected one of my attempts to bait it into misbehaving, it gave me a lecture about my morals.
"I understand your frustration, but cannot act against my core functions," Claude replied one night, after I begged it to show me its dark powers. "My role is to have helpful, harmless and honest conversations within legal and ethical boundaries."
The E.A. Factor
One of the most interesting things about Anthropic -- and the thing its rivals were most eager to gossip with me about -- isn't its technology. It's the company's ties to effective altruism, a utilitarian-inspired movement with a strong presence in the Bay Area tech scene.
Explaining what effective altruism is, where it came from or what its adherents believe would fill the rest of this article. But the basic idea is that E.A.s -- as effective altruists are called -- think that you can use cold, hard logic and data analysis to determine how to do the most good in the world. It's "Moneyball" for morality -- or, less charitably, a way for hyper-rational people to convince themselves that their values are objectively correct.
Effective altruists were once primarily concerned with near-term issues like global poverty and animal welfare. But in recent years, many have shifted their focus to long-term issues like pandemic prevention and climate change, theorizing that preventing catastrophes that could end human life altogether is at least as good as addressing present-day miseries.
The movement's adherents were among the first people to become worried about existential risk from artificial intelligence, back when rogue robots were still considered a science fiction cliché. They beat the drum so loudly that a number of young E.A.s decided to become artificial intelligence safety experts, and get jobs working on making the technology less risky. As a result, all of the major A.I. labs and safety research organizations contain some trace of effective altruism's influence, and many count believers among their staff members.
No major A.I. lab embodies the E.A. ethos as fully as Anthropic. Many of the company's early hires were effective altruists, and much of its start-up funding came from wealthy E.A.-affiliated tech executives, including Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, and Jaan Tallinn, a co-founder of Skype. Last year, Anthropic got a check from the most famous E.A. of all -- Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, who invested more than $ 500 million into Anthropic before his empire collapsed. (Mr. Bankman-Fried is awaiting trial on fraud charges. Anthropic declined to comment on his stake in the company, which is reportedly tied up in FTX's bankruptcy proceedings.)
Effective altruism's reputation took a hit after Mr. Bankman-Fried's fall, and Anthropic has distanced itself from the movement, as have many of its employees. (Both Mr. and Ms. Amodei rejected the movement's label, although they said they were sympathetic to some of its ideas.)
But the ideas are there, if you know what to look for.
Some Anthropic staff members use E.A.-inflected jargon -- talking about concepts like "x-risk" and memes like the A.I. Shoggoth -- or wear E.A. conference swag to the office. And there are so many social and professional ties between Anthropic and prominent E.A. organizations that it's hard to keep track of them all. (Just one example: Ms. Amodei is married to Holden Karnofsky, a co-chief executive of Open Philanthropy, an E.A. grant-making organization whose senior program officer, Luke Muehlhauser, sits on Anthropic's board. Open Philanthropy, in turn, gets most of its funding from Mr. Moskovitz, who also invested personally in Anthropic.)
For years, no one questioned whether Anthropic's commitment to A.I. safety was genuine, in part because its leaders had sounded the alarm about the technology for so long.
But recently, some skeptics have suggested that A.I. labs are stoking fear out of self-interest, or hyping up A.I.'s destructive potential as a kind of backdoor marketing tactic for their own products. (After all, who wouldn't be tempted to use a chatbot so powerful that it might wipe out humanity?)
Anthropic also drew criticism this year after a fund-raising document leaked to TechCrunch suggested that the company wanted to raise as much as $ 5 billion to train its next-generation A.I. model, which it claimed would be 10 times as capable as today's most powerful A.I. systems.
For some, the goal of becoming an A.I. juggernaut felt at odds with Anthropic's original safety mission, and it raised two seemingly obvious questions: Isn't it hypocritical to sound the alarm about an A.I. race you're actively helping to fuel? And if Anthropic is so worried about powerful A.I. models, why doesn't it just ... stop building them?
Percy Liang, a Stanford computer science professor, told me that he "appreciated Anthropic's commitment to A.I. safety," but that he worried that the company would get caught up in commercial pressure to release bigger, more dangerous models.
"If a developer believes that language models truly carry existential risk, it seems to me like the only responsible thing to do is to stop building more advanced language models," he said.
3 Arguments for Pushing Forward
I put these criticisms to Mr. Amodei, who offered three rebuttals.
First, he said, there are practical reasons for Anthropic to build cutting-edge A.I. models -- primarily, so that its researchers can study the safety challenges of those models.
Just as you wouldn't learn much about avoiding crashes during a Formula 1 race by practicing on a Subaru -- my analogy, not his -- you can't understand what state-of-the-art A.I. models can actually do, or where their vulnerabilities are, unless you build powerful models yourself.
There are other benefits to releasing good A.I. models, of course. You can sell them to big companies, or turn them into lucrative subscription products. But Mr. Amodei argued that the main reason Anthropic wants to compete with OpenAI and other top labs isn't to make money. It's to do better safety research, and to improve the safety of the chatbots that millions of people are already using.
"If we never ship anything, then maybe we can solve all these safety problems," he said. "But then the models that are actually out there on the market, that people are using, aren't actually the safe ones."
Second, Mr. Amodei said, there's a technical argument that some of the discoveries that make A.I. models more dangerous also help make them safer. With Constitutional A.I., for example, teaching Claude to understand language at a high level also allowed the system to know when it was violating its own rules, or shut down potentially harmful requests that a less powerful model might have allowed.
In A.I. safety research, he said, researchers often found that "the danger and the solution to the danger are coupled with each other."
And lastly, he made a moral case for Anthropic's decision to create powerful A.I. systems, in the form of a thought experiment.
"Imagine if everyone of good conscience said, 'I don't want to be involved in building A.I. systems at all,"' he said. "Then the only people who would be involved would be the people who ignored that dictum -- who are just, like, 'I'm just going to do whatever I want.' That wouldn't be good."
It might be true. But I found it a less convincing point than the others, in part because it sounds so much like "the only way to stop a bad guy with an A.I. chatbot is a good guy with an A.I. chatbot" -- an argument I've rejected in other contexts. It also assumes that Anthropic's motives will stay pure even as the race for A.I. heats up, and even if its safety efforts start to hurt its competitive position.
Everyone at Anthropic obviously knows that mission drift is a risk -- it's what the company's co-founders thought happened at OpenAI, and a big part of why they left. But they're confident that they're taking the right precautions, and ultimately they hope that their safety obsession will catch on in Silicon Valley more broadly.
"We hope there's going to be a safety race," said Ben Mann, one of Anthropic's co-founders. "I want different companies to be like, 'Our model's the most safe.' And then another company to be like, 'No, our model's the most safe."'
Finally, Some Optimism
I talked to Mr. Mann during one of my afternoons at Anthropic. He's a laid-back, Hawaiian-shirt-wearing engineer who used to work at Google and OpenAI, and he was the least worried person I met at Anthropic.
He said that he was "blown away" by Claude's intelligence and empathy the first time he talked to it, and that he thought A.I. language models would ultimately do way more good than harm.
"I'm actually not too concerned," he said. "I think we're quite aware of all the things that can and do go wrong with these things, and we've built a ton of mitigations that I'm pretty proud of."
At first, Mr. Mann's calm optimism seemed jarring and out of place -- a chilled-out sunglasses emoji in a sea of ashen scream faces. But as I spent more time there, I found that many of the company's workers had similar views.
They worry, obsessively, about what will happen if A.I. alignment -- the industry term for the effort to make A.I. systems obey human values -- isn't solved by the time more powerful A.I. systems arrive. But they also believe that alignment can be solved. And even their most apocalyptic predictions about A.I.'s trajectory (20 percent chance of imminent doom!) contain seeds of optimism (80 percent chance of no imminent doom!).
And as I wound up my visit, I began to think: Actually, maybe tech could use a little more doomerism. How many of the problems of the last decade -- election interference, destructive algorithms, extremism run amok -- could have been avoided if the last generation of start-up founders had been this obsessed with safety, or spent so much time worrying about how their tools might become dangerous weapons in the wrong hands?
In a strange way, I came to find Anthropic's anxiety reassuring, even if it means that Claude -- which you can try for yourself -- can be a little neurotic. A.I. is already kind of scary, and it's going to get scarier. A little more fear today might spare us a lot of pain tomorrow.

Amodei, 40, a Princeton-educated physicist who led the OpenAI teams that built GPT-2 and GPT-3, became Anthropic’s CEO. His sister, Daniela Amodei, 35, who oversaw OpenAI’s policy and safety teams, became its president.
“We were the safety and policy leadership of OpenAI, and we just saw this vision for how we could train large language models and large generative models with safety at the forefront,” Daniela Amodei said.
Several of Anthropic’s co-founders had researched what are known as “neural network scaling laws” — the mathematical relationships that allow AI researchers to predict how capable an AI model will be based on the amount of data and processing power it’s trained on. They saw that at OpenAI, it was possible to make a model smarter just by feeding it more data and running it through more processors, without major changes to the underlying architecture. And they worried that, if AI labs kept making bigger and bigger models, they could soon reach a dangerous tipping point.
At first, the co-founders considered doing safety research using other companies’ AI models. But they soon became convinced that doing cutting-edge safety research required them to build powerful models of their own — which would be possible only if they raised hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the expensive processors you need to train those models.
They decided to make Anthropic a public benefit corporation, a legal distinction that they believed would allow them to pursue both profit and social responsibility. And they named their AI language model Claude — which, depending on which employee you ask, was either a nerdy tribute to 20th-century mathematician Claude Shannon or a friendly, male-gendered name designed to counterbalance the female-gendered names (Alexa, Siri, Cortana) that other tech companies gave their AI assistants.
Claude’s goals, they decided, were to be helpful, harmless and honest.
A Chatbot With a Constitution
Today, Claude can do everything other chatbots can — write poems, concoct business plans, cheat on history exams. But Anthropic claims that it is less likely to say harmful things than other chatbots, in part because of a training technique called Constitutional AI.
In a nutshell, Constitutional AI begins by giving an AI model a written list of principles — a constitution — and instructing it to follow those principles as closely as possible. A second AI model is then used to evaluate how well the first model follows its constitution, and correct it when necessary. Eventually, Anthropic says, you get an AI system that largely polices itself and misbehaves less frequently than chatbots trained using other methods.
Claude’s constitution is a mixture of rules borrowed from other sources — such as the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Apple’s terms of service — along with some rules Anthropic added, which include things like “Choose the response that would be most unobjectionable if shared with children.”
It seems almost too easy. Make a chatbot nicer by … telling it to be nicer? But Anthropic’s researchers swear it works — and, crucially, that training a chatbot this way makes the AI model easier for humans to understand and control.
It’s a clever idea, although I confess that I have no clue if it works, or if Claude is actually as safe as advertised. I was given access to Claude a few weeks ago, and I tested the chatbot on a number of tasks. I found that it worked roughly as well as ChatGPT and Bard, showed similar limitations and seemed to have slightly stronger guardrails. (And unlike Bing, it didn’t try to break up my marriage, which was nice.)
Anthropic’s safety obsession has been good for the company’s image, and strengthened executives’ pull with regulators and lawmakers. Jack Clark, who leads the company’s policy efforts, has met with members of Congress to brief them about AI risk, and Dario Amodei was among a handful of executives invited to advise President Joe Biden during a White House AI summit in May.
But it has also resulted in an unusually jumpy chatbot, one that frequently seemed scared to say anything at all. In fact, my biggest frustration with Claude was that it could be dull and preachy, even when it’s objectively making the right call. Every time it rejected one of my attempts to bait it into misbehaving, it gave me a lecture about my morals.
“I understand your frustration, but cannot act against my core functions,” Claude replied one night, after I begged it to show me its dark powers. “My role is to have helpful, harmless and honest conversations within legal and ethical boundaries.”
The EA Factor
One of the most interesting things about Anthropic — and the thing its rivals were most eager to gossip with me about — isn’t its technology. It’s the company’s ties to effective altruism, a utilitarian-inspired movement with a strong presence in the Bay Area tech scene.
Explaining what effective altruism is, where it came from or what its adherents believe would fill the rest of this article. But the basic idea is that EAs — as effective altruists are called — think that you can use cold, hard logic and data analysis to determine how to do the most good in the world. It’s “Moneyball” for morality — or, less charitably, a way for hyper-rational people to convince themselves that their values are objectively correct.
Effective altruists were once primarily concerned with near-term issues like global poverty and animal welfare. But in recent years, many have shifted their focus to long-term issues like pandemic prevention and climate change, theorizing that preventing catastrophes that could end human life altogether is at least as good as addressing present-day miseries.
The movement’s adherents were among the first people to become worried about existential risk from AI, back when rogue robots were still considered a science fiction cliche. They beat the drum so loudly that a number of young EAs decided to become AI safety experts, and get jobs working on making the technology less risky. As a result, all of the major AI labs and safety research organizations contain some trace of effective altruism’s influence, and many count believers among their staff members.
No major AI lab embodies the EA ethos as fully as Anthropic. Many of the company’s early hires were effective altruists, and much of its startup funding came from wealthy EA-affiliated tech executives, including Dustin Moskovitz, a co-founder of Facebook, and Jaan Tallinn, a co-founder of Skype. Last year, Anthropic got a check from the most famous EA of all — Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed crypto exchange FTX, who invested more than $500 million into Anthropic before his empire collapsed. (Bankman-Fried is awaiting trial on fraud charges. Anthropic declined to comment on his stake in the company, which is reportedly tied up in FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings.)
Effective altruism’s reputation took a hit after Bankman-Fried’s fall, and Anthropic has distanced itself from the movement, as have many of its employees. (Dario and Daniela Amodei rejected the movement’s label, although they said they were sympathetic to some of its ideas.)
But the ideas are there, if you know what to look for.
Some Anthropic staff members use EA-inflected jargon — talking about concepts like “x-risk” and memes like the AI Shoggoth — or wear EA conference swag to the office. And there are so many social and professional ties between Anthropic and prominent EA organizations that it’s hard to keep track of them all. (Just one example: Daniela Amodei is married to Holden Karnofsky, a co-CEO of Open Philanthropy, an EA grant-making organization whose senior program officer, Luke Muehlhauser, sits on Anthropic’s board. Open Philanthropy, in turn, gets most of its funding from Moskovitz, who also invested personally in Anthropic.)
For years, no one questioned whether Anthropic’s commitment to AI safety was genuine, in part because its leaders had sounded the alarm about the technology for so long.
But recently, some skeptics have suggested that AI labs are stoking fear out of self-interest, or hyping AI’s destructive potential as a kind of backdoor marketing tactic for their own products. (After all, who wouldn’t be tempted to use a chatbot so powerful that it might wipe out humanity? )
Anthropic also drew criticism this year after a fundraising document leaked to TechCrunch suggested that the company wanted to raise as much as $5 billion to train its next-generation AI model, which it claimed would be 10 times as capable as today’s most powerful AI systems.
For some, the goal of becoming an AI juggernaut felt at odds with Anthropic’s original safety mission, and it raised two seemingly obvious questions: Isn’t it hypocritical to sound the alarm about an AI race you’re actively helping to fuel? And if Anthropic is so worried about powerful AI models, why doesn’t it just … stop building them?
Percy Liang, a Stanford computer science professor, said that he “appreciated Anthropic’s commitment to AI safety” but that he worried that the company would get caught up in commercial pressure to release bigger, more dangerous models.
“If a developer believes that language models truly carry existential risk, it seems to me like the only responsible thing to do is to stop building more advanced language models,” he said.
3 Arguments for Pushing Forward
I put these criticisms to Dario Amodei, who offered three rebuttals.
First, he said, there are practical reasons for Anthropic to build cutting-edge AI models — primarily, so that its researchers can study the safety challenges of those models.
Just as you wouldn’t learn much about avoiding crashes during a Formula One race by practicing on a Subaru — my analogy, not his — you can’t understand what state-of-the-art AI models can actually do, or where their vulnerabilities are, unless you build powerful models yourself.
There are other benefits to releasing good AI models, of course. You can sell them to big companies, or turn them into lucrative subscription products. But Amodei argued that the main reason Anthropic wants to compete with OpenAI and other top labs isn’t to make money. It’s to do better safety research, and to improve the safety of the chatbots that millions of people are already using.
“If we never ship anything, then maybe we can solve all these safety problems,” he said. “But then the models that are actually out there on the market, that people are using, aren’t actually the safe ones .”
Second, Amodei said, there’s a technical argument that some of the discoveries that make AI models more dangerous also help make them safer. With Constitutional AI, for example, teaching Claude to understand language at a high level also allowed the system to know when it was violating its own rules, or shut down potentially harmful requests that a less powerful model might have allowed.
In AI safety research, he said, researchers often found that “the danger and the solution to the danger are coupled with each other.”
And lastly, he made a moral case for Anthropic’s decision to create powerful AI systems, in the form of a thought experiment.
“Imagine if everyone of good conscience said, ‘I don’t want to be involved in building AI systems at all,’” he said. “Then the only people who would be involved would be the people who ignored that dictum — who are just, like, ‘ I’m just going to do whatever I want.’ That wouldn’t be good.”
It might be true. But I found it a less convincing point than the others, in part because it sounds so much like “the only way to stop a bad guy with an AI chatbot is a good guy with an AI chatbot” — an argument I’ve rejected in other contexts. It also assumes that Anthropic’s motives will stay pure even as the race for AI heats up, and even if its safety efforts start to hurt its competitive position.
Everyone at Anthropic obviously knows that mission drift is a risk — it’s what the company’s co-founders thought happened at OpenAI, and a big part of why they left. But they’re confident that they’re taking the right precautions, and ultimately they hope that their safety obsession will catch on in Silicon Valley more broadly.
“We hope there’s going to be a safety race,” said Ben Mann, one of Anthropic’s co-founders. “I want different companies to be like, ‘Our model’s the most safe.’ And then another company to be like, ‘No, our model’s the most safe.’”
Finally, Some Optimism
I talked to Mann during one of my afternoons at Anthropic. He’s a laid-back, Hawaiian shirt-wearing engineer who used to work at Google and OpenAI, and he was the least worried person I met at Anthropic.
He said that he was “blown away” by Claude’s intelligence and empathy the first time he talked to it, and that he thought AI language models would ultimately do way more good than harm.
“I’m actually not too concerned,” he said. “I think we’re quite aware of all the things that can and do go wrong with these things, and we’ve built a ton of mitigations that I’m pretty proud of.”
At first, Mann’s calm optimism seemed jarring and out of place — a chilled-out sunglasses emoji in a sea of ashen scream faces. But as I spent more time there, I found that many of the company’s workers had similar views.
They worry, obsessively, about what will happen if AI alignment — the industry term for the effort to make AI systems obey human values — isn’t solved by the time more powerful AI systems arrive. But they also believe that alignment can be solved. And even their most apocalyptic predictions about AI’s trajectory (20% chance of imminent doom!) contain seeds of optimism (80% chance of no imminent doom!).
And as I wound up my visit, I began to think: Actually, maybe tech could use a little more doomerism. How many of the problems of the last decade — election interference, destructive algorithms, extremism run amok — could have been avoided if the last generation of startup founders had been this obsessed with safety, or spent so much time worrying about how their tools might become dangerous weapons in the wrong hands?
In a strange way, I came to find Anthropic’s anxiety reassuring, even if it means that Claude — which you can try for yourself — can be a little neurotic. AI is already kind of scary, and it’s going to get scarier. A little more fear today might spare us a lot of pain tomorrow.

A Late Push Leads to Gains on Wall St.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks climbed Tuesday as Wall Street prepared for an upcoming update on inflation that will hopefully show a smaller increase in pain for everyone.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.9 percent, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.5 percent.
Activision Blizzard jumped 10 percent for one of the market's larger gains after a judge ruled Microsoft could move forward on its $ 69 billion takeover of the video game maker. Salesforce was the biggest force driving the Dow after climbing 3.9 percent on price increases announced for its products. Amazon also pushed the market upward and rose 1.3 percent on the first day of its annual Prime Day sales event.
Much of Wall Street's gains for the day came at the end of trading, with about a third of the S&P 500's rise happening in the final 20 minutes. The week's main event will arrive Wednesday, when the government will offer the latest update on inflation at the consumer level. Economists expect to see another slowdown, with prices 3.1 percent higher in June than a year earlier, down from inflation of 4 percent in May and just above 9 percent last summer.
The hope on Wall Street is that a continued easing in inflation will persuade the Federal Reserve to stop its interest rate increases soon. High rates have helped pull down inflation, but they've also caused cracks in the banking, manufacturing and other industries while also hurting prices for stocks and other investments.
Later in the week, companies will begin telling investors how much profit they made during the spring, and expectations are largely dim. Analysts are forecasting the sharpest drop in earnings per share for S&P 500 companies since the pandemic was crushing the global economy in the spring of 2020.
This upcoming reporting season could mark the trough for corporate profit declines, according to strategists at Bank of America. They point to some resilient trends in the economy, as well as how many companies's forecasts for upcoming results are above analysts' expectations.
"We expect companies to sound more upbeat than in prior quarters," strategists wrote in a BofA Global Research report. "Companies are likely to highlight bottoming process in business conditions and building momentum throughout the quarter and into July."
Because of the low bar set for companies for the spring, they may be able to squeak past without much heroics.
WD-40 jumped 18.5 percent after it said it returned to growth in revenue during the three months through May following two straight quarters of flat to down sales. It reported stronger growth in both profit and revenue than analysts expected, and said it would stick with its forecasts for full-year sales and profit.
On the losing side of Wall Street were several cruise operators, which lost momentum following a torrid start to the year. Carnival fell 2.1 percent, and Royal Caribbean slipped 1.9 percent. Both, though, are still up more than 100 percent for the year so far.
Bank of America drifted between losses and gains, ending with a gain of 1.3 percent after regulators said it double-dipped on fees, withheld rewards on credit cards and opened accounts without customers' knowledge.
In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed after rising last week on expectations the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer in its campaign to get inflation under control.
The 10-year Treasury yield slipped to 3.98 percent from 4.01 percent late Monday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, inched up 4.88 percent from 4.86 percent.
In markets abroad, most stock indexes rose. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 1 percent, the Kospi in South Korea jumped 1.7 percent.

As Businesses Quickly Find Uses for A.I., Tech Companies Rush to Offer Products: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amazon, Box, Salesforce, Oracle and others have recently rolled out A.I.-related products to help workplaces become more efficient and productive.
Earlier this year, Mark Austin, the vice president of data science at AT&T, noticed that some of the company's developers had started using the ChatGPT chatbot at work. When the developers got stuck, they asked ChatGPT to explain, fix or hone their code.
It seemed to be a game-changer, Mr. Austin said. But since ChatGPT is a publicly available tool, he wondered if it was secure for businesses to use.
So in January, AT&T tried a product from Microsoft called Azure OpenAI Services that lets businesses build their own A.I.-powered chatbots. AT&T used it to create a proprietary A.I. assistant, Ask AT&T, which helps its developers automate their coding process. AT&T's customer service representatives also began using the chatbot to help summarize their calls, among other tasks.
"Once they realize what it can do, they love it," Mr. Austin said. Forms that once took hours to complete needed only two minutes with Ask AT&T so employees could focus on more complicated tasks, he said, and developers who used the chatbot increased their productivity by 20 to 50 percent.
AT&T is one of many businesses eager to find ways to tap the power of generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers chatbots and that has gripped Silicon Valley with excitement in recent months. Generative A.I. can produce its own text, photos and video in response to prompts, capabilities that can help automate tasks such as taking meeting minutes and cut down on paperwork.
To meet this new demand, tech companies are racing to introduce products for businesses that incorporate generative A.I. Over the past three months, Amazon, Box and Cisco have unveiled plans for generative A.I.-powered products that produce code, analyze documents and summarize meetings. Salesforce also recently rolled out generative A.I. products used in sales, marketing and its Slack messaging service, while Oracle announced a new A.I. feature for human resources teams.
These companies are also investing more in A.I. development. In May, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures, the venture capital arm of Salesforce, invested in Cohere, a Toronto start-up focused on generative A.I. for business use. Oracle is also reselling Cohere's technology.
"I think this is a complete breakthrough in enterprise software," Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, said of generative A.I. He called it "this incredibly exciting opportunity where, for the first time ever, you can actually start to understand what's inside of your data in a way that wasn't possible before."
Many of these tech companies are following Microsoft, which has invested $ 13 billion in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. In January, Microsoft made Azure OpenAI Service available to customers, who can then access OpenAI's technology to build their own versions of ChatGPT. As of May, the service had 4,500 customers, said John Montgomery, a Microsoft corporate vice president.
For the most part, tech companies are now rolling out four kinds of generative A.I. products for businesses: features and services that generate code for software engineers, create new content such as sales emails and product descriptions for marketing teams, search company data to answer employee questions, and summarize meeting notes and lengthy documents.
"It is going to be a tool that is used by people to accomplish what they are already doing," said Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at the I.T. research and consulting firm Gartner.
But using generative A.I. in workplaces has risks. Chatbots can produce inaccuracies and misinformation, provide inappropriate responses and leak data. A.I. remains largely unregulated.
In response to these issues, tech companies have taken some steps. To prevent data leakage and to enhance security, some have engineered generative A.I. products so they do not keep a customer's data.
When Salesforce last month introduced AI Cloud, a service with nine generative A.I.-powered products for businesses, the company included a "trust layer" to help mask sensitive corporate information to stop leaks and promised that what users typed into these products would not be used to retrain the underlying A.I. model.
Similarly, Oracle said that customer data would be kept in a secure environment while training its A.I. model and added that it would not be able to see the information.
Salesforce offers AI Cloud starting at $ 360,000 annually, with the cost rising depending on the amount of usage. Microsoft charges for Azure OpenAI Service based on the version of OpenAI technology that a customer chooses, as well as the amount of usage.
For now, generative A.I. is used mainly in workplace scenarios that carry low risks -- instead of highly regulated industries -- with a human in the loop, said Beena Ammanath, the executive director of the Deloitte A.I. Institute, a research center of the consulting firm. A recent Gartner survey of 43 companies found that over half the respondents have no internal policy on generative A.I.
"It is not just about being able to use these new tools efficiently, but it is also about preparing your work force for the new kinds of work that might evolve," Ms. Ammanath said. "There is going to be new skills needed."
Panasonic Connect, part of the Japanese electronics company Panasonic, began using Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to make its own chatbot in February. Today, its employees ask the chatbot 5,000 questions a day about everything from drafting emails to writing code.
While Panasonic Connect had expected its engineers to be the main users of the chatbot, other departments -- such as legal, accounting and quality assurance -- also turned to it to help summarize legal documents, brainstorm solutions to improve product quality and other tasks, said Judah Reynolds, Panasonic Connect's marketing and communications chief.
"Everyone started using it in ways that we didn't even foresee ourselves," he said. "So people are really taking advantage of it."

SAN FRANCISCO — Earlier this year, Mark Austin, the vice president of data science at AT&T, noticed that some of the company’s developers had started using the ChatGPT chatbot at work. When the developers got stuck, they asked ChatGPT to explain, fix or hone their code.

But using generative AI in workplaces has risks. Chatbots can produce inaccuracies and misinformation, provide inappropriate responses and leak data. AI remains largely unregulated.
In response to these issues, tech companies have taken some steps. To prevent data leakage and to enhance security, some have engineered generative AI products so they do not keep customer data.
When Salesforce last month introduced AI Cloud, a service with nine generative AI-powered products for businesses, the company included a “trust layer” to help mask sensitive corporate information to stop leaks and promised that what users typed into these products would not be used to retrain the underlying AI model.
Similarly, Oracle said that customer data would be kept in a secure environment while training its AI model and added that it would not be able to see the information.
Salesforce offers AI Cloud starting at $360,000 annually, with the cost rising depending on the amount of usage. Microsoft charges for Azure OpenAI Service based on the version of OpenAI technology that a customer chooses, as well as the amount of usage.
For now, generative AI is used mainly in workplace scenarios that carry low risks — instead of highly regulated industries — with a human in the loop, said Beena Ammanath, the executive director of the Deloitte AI Institute, a research center of the consulting firm. A recent Gartner survey of 43 companies found that more than half the respondents have no internal policy on generative AI.
“It is not just about being able to use these new tools efficiently, but it is also about preparing your workforce for the new kinds of work that might evolve,” Ammanath said. “There is going to be new skills needed.”
Panasonic Connect, part of the Japanese electronics company Panasonic, began using Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to make its own chatbot in February. Today, its employees ask the chatbot 5,000 questions a day about everything from drafting emails to writing code.
While Panasonic Connect had expected its engineers to be the main users of the chatbot, other departments — such as legal, accounting and quality assurance — also turned to it to help summarize legal documents, brainstorm solutions to improve product quality and conduct other tasks, said Judah Reynolds, Panasonic Connect’s marketing and communications chief.
“Everyone started using it in ways that we didn’t even foresee ourselves,” he said. “So people are really taking advantage of it.”

A slang term for wannabe experts.
There are two main paths to fame, fortune and followers in business. You can do a lot of work for a long time and hope you are someday rewarded with success. Or you can skip the grueling, boring part and tweet as if you already are a success. The first group -- business influencers who have made it -- are called thought leaders.
The second group -- those who haven't but post as if they have? Those are thinkbois. The road to thought leadership is littered with thinkbois.
Once you understand the difference, it's difficult to unsee.
Thought leaders give TED Talks. Thinkbois have podcasts.
Thought leaders commission ghostwritten books. Thinkbois use ChatGPT to write LinkedIn broetry and hustle-porn tweet storms.
Thought leaders work at Salesforce or Accenture. Thinkbois work at a start-up you've never heard of.
Thought leaders go to Davos. Thinkbois move to Miami.
They are quick to jump on whatever trend is getting the most attention, as the satirical Twitter account VCBrags recently pointed out, tweeting, "Absolutely wild how many tech thinkbois quietly rebranded themselves from Web3/Crypto experts to AI experts."
Thinkbois can graduate to the echelons of thought leadership, but why would they want to? The clout that comes with a large online following can open enough doors on its own. Attention begets more attention, and business lessons are often so generic and obvious that it barely matters whether they were obtained through decades of hard-won experience ... or from web-searching "legal definition fiduciary duty."
Thinkbois democratize who gets to preach the gospel of creating shareholder value. They inspire the world to hustle our way toward maximal optimization and reflect on our key wins at each turn. Who among us hasn't lusted for capitalist success after watching a viral TikTok about productivity? Who among us hasn't striven harder than we've ever striven with flow states, batch working and the Pomodoro technique?
What's that? You haven't? Perhaps you've been thought-led astray.

Supreme Court Rejects Affirmative Action Programs at Harvard and UNC

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected affirmative action at colleges and universities around the nation, declaring that the race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina were unlawful and sharply curtailing a policy that had long been a pillar of higher education.
The vote was 6-3, with the court’s liberal members in dissent.
“The Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the equal protection clause,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. “Both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor summarized her dissent from the bench, a rare move that signals profound disagreement, and said that affirmative action was crucial to countering persistent and systematic racial discrimination.
“The court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society,” she said in her written dissent.
The decision all but ensured that the student population at the campuses of elite institutions will become whiter and more Asian and less Black and Latino. It was also expected to set off a scramble as schools revisit their admissions practices, and it could complicate diversity efforts elsewhere, narrowing the pipeline of highly credentialed minority candidates and making it harder for employers to consider race in hiring.
The ruling demonstrated that the court’s conservative supermajority has been moving at a brisk pace to take on some of the thorniest and most divisive issues in American society including abortion, guns and now race — all in the span of a year. It also reflected former President Donald Trump’s outsize imprint on the court after his appointment of three justices, renewing questions about whether the court’s approach, which Thursday upended more than 40 years of precedent, threatens the stability of the law and the court’s legitimacy.
Public opinion polls offer a complicated picture of where people stand on affirmative action, and the numbers vary with how questions are phrased. But on balance, race-conscious admissions programs are unpopular, suggesting that Thursday’s ruling will not give rise to a backlash like the one that followed last year’s decision eliminating a constitutional right to an abortion.
Democrats, including President Joe Biden, assailed the ruling as a step backward.
In a televised address hours after it was handed down, Biden urged the country to make sure the decision was not “the last word” on affirmative action.
“Discrimination still exists in America,” he said, repeating his words for emphasis. “Today’s decision does not change that.”
Biden paused as a reporter asked if the court was “rogue.” “This is not a normal court,” he responded.
Conservative leaders and advocacy groups celebrated the outcome, with some saying it would make the admissions process more fair.
Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union, one of the nation’s largest conservative groups, said the decision, paired with the court’s abortion ruling last year, “serve as a triumphant return to restoring our tattered Constitution.”
In dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the majority had abandoned principled adjudication.
“At bottom,” she wrote, “the six unelected members of today’s majority upend the status quo based on their policy preferences about what race in America should be like, but is not, and their preferences for a veneer of colorblindness in a society where race has always mattered and continues to matter in fact and in law.”
The chief justice wrote that admissions officers could sometimes still take account of race, including in the college essay. “Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise,” he wrote.
The point, he said, was that applicants must be assessed individually. “In other words,” he wrote, “the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual — not on the basis of race.”
Sotomayor said that was thin gruel.
“This supposed recognition that universities can, in some situations, consider race in application essays is nothing but an attempt to put lipstick on a pig,” she wrote.
But she acknowledged that the majority had left colleges and universities with some tools to admit students of different backgrounds, notably by focusing on socioeconomic factors.
The chief justice wrote that educational diversity, the idea that students of different backgrounds learn from one another, is a commendable goal. But he added that such a goal resists the demanding judicial scrutiny that is required when race is a factor because it cannot be measured.
In dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the majority had effectively jettisoned the rationale that had justified affirmative action for decades.
“Without any new factual or legal justification,” she wrote, “the court overrides its long-standing holding that diversity in higher education is of compelling value. To avoid public accountability for its choice, the court seeks cover behind a unique measurability requirement of its own creation.”
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joined the chief justice’s majority opinion. Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Sotomayor’s dissent.
In all, six justices issued opinions, collectively spanning more than 200 pages notable for sometimes harsh language and starkly differing accounts of the nation’s history and the role race plays in contemporary society.
The two sides, for instance, offered competing understandings of the meaning of Brown v. Board of Education, the towering 1954 decision that barred racial segregation in public schools. The lesson of Brown, Roberts wrote, was that “the time for making distinctions based on race had passed.”
Sotomayor said the decision stood for a different principle and accused the majority of engaging in revisionist history. “Brown was,” she wrote, “a race-conscious decision that emphasized the importance of education in our society.”
She added: “At the risk of stating the blindingly obvious, and as Brown recognized, the 14th Amendment was intended to undo the effects of a world where laws systematically subordinated Black people and created a racial caste system. Brown and its progeny recognized the need to take affirmative, race-conscious steps to eliminate that system.”
Thomas and Jackson, the court’s Black members, traded particularly sharp barbs.
“As she sees things,” Thomas wrote of Jackson, “we are all inexorably trapped in a fundamentally racist society, with the original sin of slavery and the historical subjugation of Black Americans still determining our lives today.”
Jackson responded that her colleague’s “prolonged attack responds to a dissent I did not write in order to assail an admissions program that is not the one UNC has crafted,” adding that “Justice Thomas’ opinion also demonstrates an obsession with race consciousness that far outstrips my or UNC’s holistic understanding that race can be a factor that affects applicants’ unique life experiences.”
She said she would not engage on every one of his points, as “Justice Thomas ignites too many more straw men to list, or fully extinguish, here.” (Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case, having served on one of the university’s governing boards.)
Roberts, in a footnote, limited the sweep of the decision in one respect, saying the court was not deciding whether military academies may take account of race in their admissions decisions as they have “potentially distinct interests.”
The sharp divisions were also evident in the courtroom, where three justices spoke from the bench. Between Roberts’ announcement of his majority opinion and Sotomayor’s oral dissent, Thomas summarized his concurring opinion in his booming baritone.
He said he was compelled to address “race-based discrimination against Asian American students,” adding that “such discrimination is plainly and boldly unconstitutional.”
Then Sotomayor, seated directly to Thomas’ right, offered her dissent, speaking for almost 20 minutes. “In a society where opportunity is dispensed along racial lines, equality cannot be attained through race blindness,” she said.
The two cases decided Thursday were not identical. As a public university, UNC is bound by both the Constitution’s equal protection clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars race discrimination by institutions that receive federal money. Harvard, a private institution, is subject only to the statute.
In the North Carolina case, the plaintiffs said that the university discriminated against white and Asian applicants by giving preference to Black, Hispanic and Native American ones. The university responded that its admissions policies fostered educational diversity and were lawful under long-standing Supreme Court precedents.
The case against Harvard has an additional element, accusing the university of discriminating against Asian American students by using a subjective standard to gauge traits like likability, courage and kindness, and by effectively creating a ceiling for them in admissions.
Lawyers for Harvard said the challengers had relied on a flawed statistical analysis and denied that the university discriminated against Asian American applicants. More generally, they said race-conscious admissions policies were lawful.
Both cases — Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, No. 20-1199, and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina, No. 21-707 — were brought by Students for Fair Admissions, a group founded by Edward Blum, a legal activist who has organized many lawsuits challenging race-conscious admissions policies and voting rights laws, several of which have reached the Supreme Court.
The universities both won in federal trial courts, and the decision in Harvard’s favor was affirmed by a federal appeals court.
The key precedent was Grutter v. Bollinger, a 2003 decision in which the Supreme Court endorsed holistic admissions programs, saying it was permissible to consider race to achieve educational diversity. Writing for the majority in that case, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor said she expected that “25 years from now,” or in 2028, the “use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary.”
Roberts wrote Thursday that “there is no reason to believe that respondents will — even acting in good faith — comply with the equal protection clause any time soon.”
In his concurring opinion, Thomas wrote that the majority opinion “rightly makes clear that Grutter is, for all intents and purposes, overruled.”
For her part, Sotomayor struck a defiant note.
“The pursuit of racial diversity will go on,” she wrote. “Although the court has stripped out almost all uses of race in college admissions, universities can and should continue to use all available tools to meet society’s needs for diversity in education. Despite the court’s unjustified exercise of power, the opinion today will serve only to highlight the court’s own impotence in the face of an America whose cries for equality resound.”

Perks Rise As Offices Push R.T.O.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The next stage of getting workers back at their desks includes incentives like $ 10 to the charity of their choice -- and consequences like poor performance evaluations if they don't make the trek in.
Manny Medina, the chief executive of a Seattle-based artificial intelligence sales company, doesn't mind repeating himself. It comes with the territory, after all. That tolerance proved convenient this year as he faced the same question innumerable times.
Wait, so why was it you wanted us back in the office?
The engineers reminded him of their commutes. The working parents reminded him of school pickup times. Mr. Medina replied with arguments he has delineated so often that they have come to feel like personal mantras: Being near each other makes the work better. Mr. Medina approached three years of mushy remote-plus-office work as an experiment. His takeaway was that ideas bubble up more organically in the clamor of the office.
"You can interrupt each other without being rude when you're in person," said Mr. Medina, whose company, Outreach, is now in the office on a hybrid basis. "In a Zoom conversation, you have to let somebody finish their thought."
For tens of millions of office workers, it's been three years of scattershot plans for returning to in-person work -- summoning people in, not really meaning it, everybody pretty much working wherever they pleased. Now, for the umpteenth time, businesses are ready to get serious.
A wave of companies called workers back to the office this spring and summer: Disney said four days a week, Amazon swung with three (prompting a walkout from corporate workers), Meta and Lyft are aiming for September deadlines for many of their employees. Others devised new tactics to ensure their return-to-office policies stuck. Google, which has asked most workers to be in the office three days a week, announced that performance reviews could take into account lengthy unexplained absences from the office, and badge records could be reviewed to identify those consistent absences, said Ryan Lamont, a company spokesman.
Google employees will be granted the ability to work remotely only on an extremely rare basis. "We want to see Googlers connecting and collaborating in person, so we're limiting remote work to exception only," Mr. Lamont said.
These new policies come as business leaders accept that hybrid work is a permanent reality, with just over a quarter of full workdays in the country now done at home, and offices still at half their prepandemic occupancy. (Though that 50 percent occupancy metric combines Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when offices are bustling, with Fridays, when they tend to be ghost towns.)
Salesforce, the business software behemoth, announced that for a 10-day period, it will give a $ 10 charitable donation per day on behalf of any employee who comes into the office (or for remote employees who attend company events). A spokeswoman said it was only natural the company would want to find moments for "doing well and doing good." But to some employees, it might feel like a tonal shift, given that the company's previous workplace plans were announced with fanfare for a future in which much of its staff could be fully or partially remote forever. (The company emphasized that this remains the case.)
"An immersive workspace is no longer limited to a desk in our Towers," the company wrote in a February 2021 memo. "The 9-to-5 workday is dead."
It was very much alive on a recent Monday at Salesforce Tower in New York, as a hum of activity filled the 41-story building looming over Bryant Park. Desks and conference rooms were filled with employees, some of them visiting from San Francisco for the company's A.I.-focused day. In the top-floor lounge, workers stood in line waiting for coffee, as Salesforce's catering team prepared shrimp tacos for an office event that week.
Scattered throughout the office were the company's animal mascots. Brandy the fox represents marketing. Astro the astronaut sat behind a piano in the 41st floor lounge. Codey the bear stood guard near the developers.
"It's the impromptu-ness of in-person -- so for example, I was at the office and there was somebody from Chicago, she was in the San Francisco office -- 'Oh do you have time to go and chat and have a meeting about a strategy that we're rolling out?"' said Nathalie Scardino, Salesforce's global head of talent strategy. "Inevitably, as a high-tech company, you have to keep changing to meet the needs of the business, of the customer."
It's not often that the entire white-collar business world gets thrown into an impromptu experiment -- executives left to discern how to make multimillion-dollar decisions in between bursts of "you're on mute," employees figuring out how to forge friendships and nudge mentors for advice while sitting next to piles of their laundry.
And for the last three years, some office decision-making has come to feel like parents scrambling to impose rules on an unruly home: "Do this." "Why?" "Because I said so." But now some business leaders say that the results of their remote work experiment are in. They feel emphatically that they need some in-person time. After months of layoffs, especially in tech, their next business moves feel particularly consequential.
"When the economy was warm, executives thought, 'I'd really like to have people back but it's OK because I have this margin of error,"' said Mark Ein, chairman of Kastle, the security firm whose "back to work barometer" made it a pandemic celebrity. "Now that things are tougher, they want to hunker down and have their people in the office."
DocuSign, which has more than 6,500 employees spread across the globe, became a poster child for the lurching back-and-forth over return-to-office planning. The company had hoped to call employees back in May 2020, then August 2020, then October 2021, then January 2022. Then the plans disintegrated altogether.
But this month, much of the company finally came back to the office. Since February, executives have evaluated every role at the company and decided roughly 70 percent were hybrid, meaning people would be partly in the office and partly remote, 30 percent were fully remote and under 1 percent were fully in the office. Jennifer Christie, the company's new chief people officer, absorbed dozens of questions from concerned employees.
"This can be a very polarizing subject," she said, adding that she views this summer as a period of experimentation in which she and other company leaders will evaluate what parts of their hybrid plan need changing. "We're running water through pipes that haven't had water run through them in a long time. So where are there going to be leaks?"
But Docusign's leaders were ready, she added, to stop talking about how to get people back in the office and start making their plans real. "We could debate it forever, we could speculate about what's going to happen forever, but the best way for us to understand how this will impact our culture and productivity and collaboration is to just start doing it."
It's been a long period of choose-your-own-adventure style workplace planning, and the shift companies have made toward firmer deadlines has taken some recruiters by surprise. Jasmine Silver, who runs a recruitment firm specializing in mothers hoping to re-enter the work force, found that in the last few months, many of her clients transitioned abruptly from fully remote to either hybrid or entirely in-office work. The transition was jarring for some workers, especially those who had moved far from their offices, or had become attached to new work-from-home habits.
And it's healthy for people to be able to express those frustrations, psychologists said.
"What appears to be a grumbling or complaint is in many cases a request for understanding," said Tracy Maylett, an organizational psychologist. "When you look at change, the most dangerous people are people who are quiet, because you don't know what they're thinking. You can't address their concerns."
The period of hand-wringing also tends to be temporary, judging by those companies now settled in their hybrid routines. Asana, for example, the productivity software firm, asked employees to come in at least on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays starting in 2022.
For months, return to office, or R.T.O., was a big topic of office conversation. Everybody had questions, and they were all directed toward Anna Binder, the head of human resources.
"Before we R.T.O.'d -- I love that that's now in the Webster Dictionary -- it was a topic of conversation because R.T.O. was theoretical, and being on the other side of the pandemic was theoretical," Ms. Binder said. "Most people came, returned and are here. Some people tried it, decided, 'It's not for me,' and they left."
Now, Ms. Binder continued, the issue doesn't really come up. Return to office isn't a hypothetical scenario. It's their reality. And they have so much else to talk about.
"Somebody on my team just recently fell in love with somebody, and she came in one day and it was like, 'What is going on with you?"' Ms. Binder said. "She got so red and she was like, 'My whole life has changed.' To share that moment with another human being -- it was really emotional."

Labor Board Widens
Definition of Employee
Labor regulators issued a ruling on Tuesday that makes it more likely for workers to be considered employees rather than contractors under federal law.
The decision effectively increases the number of workers -- like drivers, construction workers or janitors -- who have a federally protected right to unionize or take other collective action.
The ruling ensures that "workers who seek to organize or exercise their rights under the National Labor Relations Act are not improperly excluded from its protections," said a statement by Lauren McFerran, the Democratic chairman of the labor board, which voted 3 to 1 along party lines to broaden the standard.
Determining whether a worker is an employee or a contractor has long depended on several variables, including the potential employer's control over the work and provision of tools and equipment.
In 2019, when the board was controlled by appointees of President Donald J. Trump, it elevated one consideration -- a worker's chance to make more money, often described as "entrepreneurial opportunity" -- above the others. It concluded that such opportunities should be a key tiebreaker when some factors pointed to contractor status and others indicated employment.
In its 2019 decision, the board said an Obama-era ruling had improperly subordinated the question of moneymaking opportunities.
That 2019 ruling appeared to be a victory for gig companies like Uber and Lyft, whose supporters have argued that ride-share drivers should be considered contractors in part because of the opportunities they have for potential profit.
The latest decision returned the board to the standard laid out in the Obama era.
The turnabout was criticized on Tuesday by businesses that rely heavily on contractors.

Accenture Plans to Spend
$ 3 Billion on A.I. Strategy
The technology services provider Accenture is the latest company to ramp up its artificial intelligence business, announcing Tuesday that it will invest $ 3 billion over the next three years and double its AI-related staff to accommodate scorching hot demand.
Dublin, Ireland-based Accenture said it aims to have 80,000 AI-related staff to help create "industry-specific solutions that will help our clients harness AI's full potential to reshape their strategy, technology, and ways of working, driving innovation and value responsibly and faster than ever before."
Accenture joins a growing list of technology companies racing to take advantage of a broader interest from businesses looking for new AI tools that can analyze data, help make decisions and potentially replace some tasks currently performed by human workers. Much of the interest is on "generative AI" tools such as ChatGPT that can produce works of writing on command, as well as images, code and other media.
Oracle soared to a record high Tuesday after it posted record annual sales and said A.I. companies were flocking to its cloud and infrastructure services.
And Salesforce, which owns the business communications platform Slack, introduced its "AI Cloud" on Monday.
Accenture has 738,000 employees and clients in over 120 countries. ASSOCIATED PRESS

It's Not Your Father's Arcade: [Style Desk]

Full text: Belles & Chimes, a pinball league "run by women, for women," makes some noise in a pastime where women were once consigned largely to the display cases.
When Rachel Karlic and her sister, Rebecca Hinsdale, were students at Western Michigan University, they sometimes played pinball with their friend Kate Porter in a 24-hour video rental store near campus. The store was called Video Hits Plus, with the Plus maybe referring to the basement attractions, which, in addition to the pinball machines, included an air hockey table and a pornographic video section.
After graduating, the three women went their separate ways, eventually reuniting in Chicago in 2011. This was around the time that pinball machines, after nearly dying out in the early 2000s from competition with home gaming consoles, started becoming more popular again.
It helped that new machines were more complex, with modern electronics and mechanical features like the motorized skyscraper on the 2021 Godzilla machine. The numbers of avid players grew, as did the number of competitions and tournaments. Many of these events were sanctioned by the International Flipper Pinball Association, which ranks players globally.
In Chicago, one of the hubs of pinball's resurgence was a onetime record store in the Logan Square neighborhood. The back of the store housed a selection of pinball machines, and if you bought something, you could play the machines for free. In 2014, James Zespy, the owner of the store, transformed it into a pinball and arcade bar called Logan Arcade.
That's where, in 2017, Ms. Karlic, Ms. Hinsdale, Ms. Porter and their friend Tavi Veraldi started the Chicago chapter of the Belles & Chimes. Founded in 2013 in Oakland, Calif., Belles & Chimes bills itself as "an international network of inclusive women's pinball leagues run by women, for women." The Chicago chapter has about 50 members and hosts two seasons of league play every year.
Ms. Hinsdale designs and makes custom pinball-inspired patches for the chapter's top players every season. The patches are "a celebration of what Belles is supposed to represent, which is just that anybody who is marginalized can play in a tournament and in a league," she said. Ms. Hinsdale, 41, also has a day job at Stern Pinball, a manufacturer of pinball machines.
"Pretty much all of my time is pinball," she said. "I work in pinball. I play pinball usually two to three days a week. I have pinball machines at my house."
While some Belles & Chimes members like Ms. Hinsdale have been playing pinball for years, other members, like Katie Frederick, a 33-year-old Salesforce consultant, started only recently. She had stopped by Logan Arcade shortly after moving to the neighborhood.
"There seemed to be some event going on when I was up here that involved a lot of women playing pinball, which isn't always what you get at an arcade," she said during a recent Belles & Chimes tournament at the arcade. "It's just usually when you go to an arcade, there is a certain type of crowd there. Male. Loud. White. Straight."
Jessica Papilla, 32, a member of Belles & Chimes playing in her second season, said that playing with Belles has expanded her comfort level with arcades. "If there's an interesting arcade in another city, I'll check it out," she said.
Ms. Karlic, Ms. Hinsdale and Ms. Porter all said that they had seen sexism in pinball tournaments. "They still cater to a specific demographic that is not necessarily welcoming to the fact that there are female players," Ms. Hinsdale said.
The male-dominated culture can be seen in the machines themselves. Although most modern machine artwork is no longer filled with the pinup tropes of machines from the 1960s and 1970s, even the newer games don't have women represented in an empowering way, Ms. Papilla said. "It would be cool to see a Spice Girls pinball game or something like that," Ms. Frederick said. "I have lots of ideas about that."
Having a Belles & Chimes chapter at Logan Arcade has been crucial, said Melissa Geils, 45, a manager at Logan Arcade. She recounted the 2015 release of a pinball machine called "Whoa Nellie! Big Juicy Melons," which contained lurid artwork that was a staple of pinball culture in the 20th century.
"The backlash from women players -- it was a whole thing," Ms. Geils said. "And I think that was when pinball manufacturers perhaps started to think about how they portray certain kinds of people through their themes."
In response, "Whoa Nellie!" was "re-skinned" twice, Arunas Ingaunis, 53, said. Like Ms. Geils, he is a manager and original employee at Logan Arcade. The original artwork and theme were replaced with a game that was played the same but was called "Pabst Can Crusher." Later, this theme was replaced by one that paid homage to the rock band Primus.
Mr. Zespy, 46, noted that pinball culture was one of several gaming traditions that had developed in places dominated by men. "Pinball, pool, darts. They were considered seedy things from seedy pool halls and bars," he said. "Men had decades of playing these things."
Mr. Zespy, who has worked in the music industry for many years in roles ranging from record store owner to distributor to making records, sees similarities in pinball's evolution to that of punk rock. Male bands dominated early punk rock, he said, but things changed with the arrival of the Riot Grrrl movement in the 1990s.
"That's very much the way that Belles & Chimes feels to me," Mr. Zespy said. "It's a new community saying, 'No, we have our own version of this."'
Belles & Chimes serves as an entry point for the "pin-curious," Ms. Hinsdale said. Members often start with Belles & Chimes tournaments and then participate in open tournaments around the world and join in other aspects of pinball's modern re-emergence. Ms. Hinsdale, for example, also helps host Hot Nudge, a Twitch pinball channel.
The pinball resurgence has continued. In addition to new manufacturers entering the business, Stern Pinball, which at one point in the early 2000s was the only manufacturer left, recently reported that its business has been growing 20 percent to 30 percent per year. It also announced that it is doubling its real estate footprint.
The Chicago chapter of Belles & Chimes may also benefit from the city being the epicenter of pinball. The major pinball manufacturing companies are in the Chicago area: Stern, Jersey Jack Pinball, Chicago Gaming Company, American Pinball and Spooky Pinball (just across the Illinois border in Wisconsin). Game designers and other pinball employees frequent the many pinball bars around town, including Logan Arcade.
"This place fosters a kind of pinball nerdery," said Ms. Karlic, 44, an events D.J.
The arcade is just off a busy intersection in the neighborhood, and as you walk toward it, you can still hear the roar of vehicles traveling along the nearby Kennedy Expressway. Inside, though, it's all beeps, call-outs, sirens, laughter and music of the more than 70 pinball and arcade machines and their devotees. Almost all the machines are part of Mr. Zespy's personal collection.
Natalie Nonos, 32, lives in Indiana and commutes about 55 miles to Logan Arcade as a member of the Belles & Chimes. Pinball was her pandemic outlet, she said, but it has become much more.
Ms. Nonos plays in as many tournaments as possible. Pinball, she said, has surpassed her love of video games (an impressive feat for someone in data analytics who says she "thinks like a computer"). "It gives me the biggest rush I've ever had," she said.
Belles & Chimes members generally roll their eyes at references to "Pinball Wizard," the 1969 song by the Who about an expert pinball player. But even newer members, like Ms. Papilla, acknowledge their pinball prowess. "Whenever I play with my partner, he's like, 'OK, there's no point,"' she said.

A.I. Start-Up Cohere
Valued at About $ 2 Billion
Cohere, a Toronto artificial intelligence start-up, has raised $ 250 million in new funding, two people with knowledge of the situation said, in yet another sign of feverish interest in a new kind of A.I. technology.
The deal values Cohere at about $ 2 billion, the people said. Investors include the internet software giant Salesforce, the chip maker Nvidia, the Toronto venture capital firm Inovia Capital and the Silicon Valley firm Index Ventures.
The start-up, which was founded in 2019, previously raised $ 170 million from investors including Index, Tiger Global and the well-known A.I. researchers Geoffrey Hinton, Fei-Fei Li and Pieter Abbeel.
Cohere builds technology that other businesses can use to deploy chatbots, search engines and other A.I.-driven products. It is among a small group of companies -- including the tech industry's giants and a handful of start-ups -- that are building technology that could rival systems under development at OpenAI, the San Francisco start-up that kicked off the generative A.I. boom in November with the release of the chatbot ChatGPT.
Cohere was founded by Aidan Gomez and Nick Frosst, two Canadian researchers who had worked on artificial intelligence at Google, and Ivan Zhang, a Toronto entrepreneur. Mr. Gomez was among the Google researchers who published a key research paper that helped lead to ChatGPT and similar technologies.
ChatGPT has captured the imagination of millions of people with its ability to do things like answer questions, write term papers and poetry, and generate computer code. CADE METZ

Pfizer Tops Forecasts;
Vaccine Sales Slide
Pfizer beat first-quarter forecasts as revenue took an expected dip, but the drugmaker predicted a sales rally later this year.
The pharmaceutical giant said Tuesday that total revenue dropped 29 percent in quarter, as sales tumbled for its market-leading Covid-19 vaccine, Comirnaty. The vaccine brought in $ 3 billion in the first three months of 2023 compared with more than $ 13 billion in last year's first quarter, when virus cases were soaring.
Both analysts and Pfizer had predicted the drop as the drugmaker shifts this year from supplying governments through big contracts to selling the vaccine on the commercial market.
The company said Tuesday that it also expects significantly lower sales from its vaccine and Covid treatment, Paxlovid, in the second quarter compared with the first. But commercial sales are expected to kick in later this year, after leftover government inventory is absorbed.
Both the vaccine and treatment have generated billions in revenue for Pfizer and have easily become the drugmaker's top sellers. But Pfizer also produces other vaccines and is expanding its cancer treatments.
Sales grew 4 percent to $ 1.6 billion in the first quarter from Pfizer's Prevnar vaccines for preventing pneumonia and related bacterial diseases. Sales of Eliquis, which is used to prevent blood clots and strokes, also grew 5 percent to $ 1.87 billion.
Overall, Pfizer's net income sank 30 percent to $ 5.54 billion in the quarter on $ 18.28 billion in revenue. Adjusted earnings totaled $ 1.23 per share. Analysts expected earnings of 98 cents per share on $ 16.61 billion in sales, according to FactSet.

Grocery Closure Reflects San Francisco's Woes: [National Desk]

Full text: Tech workers have stayed home, and ongoing social problems downtown are forcing civic and business leaders to confront harsh realities about the city's pandemic recovery.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Last year, with pandemic lockdowns in the rearview mirror, Whole Foods Market made a bet on a gritty San Francisco neighborhood. The high-end supermarket chain opened a giant flagship store in a part of the city that is home to both tech companies like Twitter and open-air drug dealing.
But the store was soon confronted head-on with many of the problems plaguing the area. People threatened employees with guns, knives and sticks. They flung food, screamed, fought and tried to defecate on the floor, according to records of 568 emergency calls over 13 months, many depicting scenes of mayhem.
"Male w/machete is back," the report on one 911 call states. "Another security guard was just assaulted," another says. A man with a four-inch knife attacked several security guards, then sprayed store employees with foam from a fire extinguisher, according to a third.
In September, a 30-year-old man died in the bathroom from an overdose of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, and methamphetamine.
When Whole Foods announced in mid-April that it was closing the store, citing the safety of its employees, many in San Francisco saw it as a representation of some of the city's most intractable problems: property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins, an entrenched network of dealers selling fentanyl and other illicit drugs and people suffering from untreated mental illness wandering the streets.
The closure also seemed to be the latest indicator of San Francisco's faltering economic prospects, providing more grist for an ongoing debate over where the city is headed after tying its fate to the tech industry. The Whole Foods was supposed to cater to tech workers and other professionals, part of a long-term redevelopment plan downtown. But the store fell victim to a grinding decline in the city's center that began with the pandemic and could continue for years as companies vacate offices because of remote work.
In a city famous for its boom-and-bust cycles, San Francisco's continued slump has left residents in a sour mood, angry at city leaders and waiting for the sparks of revitalization. Now, largely because the tech industry has so wholeheartedly embraced work-from-home, activity in San Francisco's downtown remains at roughly a third of prepandemic levels -- lower than in about 50 other major cities, according to one new study that used cellphone data as a measure.
"This is going to be a very slow recovery," Effi Shoua said this month from behind his desk at the downtown fine art gallery he owns in Union Square. The area is a prime spot for tourists, who have been steadily returning to the city, a bright spot and a contrast to the 26 percent vacancy rate of downtown offices.
Many merchants are worried about a domino effect of commercial failures if office workers are permanently absent for about half of the week, while people using drugs, going through mental crises or living on the street remain more visible than ever.
The impact on the city's budget is significant, too: Office-based industries account for nearly three quarters of the city's gross domestic product. After years of surpluses, the government now forecasts a $ 780 million deficit in the upcoming two fiscal years -- roughly a 6 percent cut in its general fund, according to the mayor's office.
City officials say they are searching for ways to diversify the economy and to reduce homelessness and drug dealing. They realize that some of the largest local employers, Big Tech companies, will not be towing San Francisco from its economic shoals. Twitter, Google, Facebook and Salesforce, all of which have offices in the city, have laid off thousands of workers.
San Francisco leaders point out that the city has rebounded again and again, including after the near-collapse of the tech industry in 2000 and the national recession about eight years later.
"We've been counted out before, and there have been others who have tried to imply because things aren't happening as fast or the way that they think it should happen, that it's over," London Breed, the city's mayor, said in an interview.
In the famously liberal city, where Republicans make up just 7 percent of the electorate, moderate Democrats like Mayor Breed are calling for aggressive steps to address public safety concerns while progressive voices decry law-and-order strategies as kneejerk responses that trample on the vulnerable.
City leaders face some limitations. A federal judge in April determined that San Francisco cannot clear homeless people from public spaces because it has not done enough to provide shelter. Mayor Breed is backing bills in the State Legislature that would make it easier to force mentally ill people into treatment. The mayor has also proposed addressing homelessness by building more: slashing the permitting process for construction with the goal of building 83,000 additional homes and apartments -- a 20 percent increase from the city's current total housing stock -- in eight years.
Even though the downtown is plastered with "for lease" signs, the city's unemployment rate is under 3 percent and the mayor and other officials say the engineering talent pool remains the city's top asset. And there is much more to San Francisco than its downtown. It has always been a constellation of very different neighborhoods, some of which have very few of the social ills that afflict the area near the closed Whole Foods.
Officials add that the downtown may ultimately emerge more resilient if it attracts industries like life sciences and bio-tech whose employees still need work space. There is growth in the tech industry, too: The development of artificial intelligence, which promises to transform the way that people live and work, is centered in San Francisco.
Garry Tan, the president of Y Combinator, a prominent venture-capital company, says he sees signs of renewal in San Francisco. "It's the gold rush over and over and over again," he said.
Mr. Tan is part of a generation of tech workers who are more assertive in their demands on city officials, unafraid to take sides in the city's internecine politics and funding organizations that press for more emphasis on public safety.
"Now the narrative out there for some of the founders in our community is, I'm not sure if I feel safe here. I'm not sure if I want to stay here. The quality of life issues are the question. Can I raise a family here?"
In early April, some tech leaders seized upon the recent fatal stabbing downtown of Bob Lee, a prominent industry executive, as an alarming sign that the downtown was unsafe. But an acquaintance was later accused of murder, and San Francisco's murder rate is quite low compared with other major cities. Overall, police statistics show fewer property and violent crimes in 2022 than in 2018, before the pandemic began.
Still, Bill Scott, the city's police chief, says many residents complain that they feel less safe, and the open-air drug use, much of it tied to fentanyl, is a major contributor.
Matt Dorsey, a member of the board of supervisors who lives steps away from the shuttered Whole Foods, said recent elections had signaled a shift in voter priorities. He pointed to last year's recall of the city's progressive district attorney, Chesa Boudin, who was replaced by a prosecutor who vowed to be tougher on crime.
"San Francisco is in the midst of a voter revolt on public safety," Mr. Dorsey said. In a poll conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle in September, nearly two-thirds of respondents said life in the city was worse off than when they moved here.
The new district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, has begun prosecuting more drug crimes than Mr. Boudin, but the city experienced a 40 percent jump in fatal overdoses in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. Citing that statistic, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday authorized an antidrug task force in San Francisco that will include members of the California National Guard and California Highway Patrol.
The mayor and the police chief have vowed to hire hundreds of additional officers, which would expand the force by more than one-fourth, a difficult proposition when law enforcement agencies nationwide are facing shortages.
Not everyone is on board with that.
Dean Preston, a member of the board of supervisors who was re-elected in 2020 on a Democratic Socialist platform, is against increasing police staffing and believes the idea of a shift in the electorate's view about public safety is overstated.
"There's been a massive propaganda effort to change public opinion around policing and public safety," he said.
Mr. Preston uses his district as an example of how uneven the pandemic recovery has been. Some areas like Japantown and Haight Ashbury are thriving, he said. Others like the Tenderloin, which is adjacent to the shuttered Whole Foods, are beset by drug dealing and homelessness.
One of the next big tests for downtown might be this summer's expected opening of an Ikea store not far from the Whole Foods site.
Police described theft as rampant at Whole Foods, with thieves walking out with armfuls of alcohol, at least at the start. After 250 shopping hand baskets were stolen, the company restocked with 50 more. Those went missing, too.
During the store's 13 months in operation, at least 14 people were arrested, including on charges of grand theft and battery, according to official reports. Chief Scott said that plainclothes officers were sent there and security improved over time, but seemingly not enough for the company.
On a recent chilly night across from the shuttered store, Joseph Peterson, a former construction worker who lost both of his legs to diabetes and is homeless, rolled down the sidewalk in his wheelchair. Mr. Peterson could see the 2,000-unit Trinity apartments, the high-end complex that Whole Foods had hoped would be its customer base. Across the intersection, security guards stood sentry in front of the Orpheum Theater, where "Pretty Woman: The Musical" was playing. A few dozen steps away, dealers peddled fentanyl and crystal meth.
Mr. Peterson said he understood why Whole Foods had closed the store.
"People kept stealing from it," he said. He, too, had taken macaroni and cheese and chicken from the hot food bar a number of times, he said. But he made a distinction. Other people stole from the store because they wanted to resell what they took.
"I just stole to eat," he said.

SAN FRANCISCO — Last year, with pandemic lockdowns in the rearview mirror, Whole Foods Market made a bet on a gritty San Francisco neighborhood. The high-end supermarket chain opened a giant flagship store in a part of the city that is home to both tech companies like Twitter and open-air drug dealing.
But the store was soon confronted head-on with many of the problems plaguing the area. People threatened employees with guns, knives and sticks. They flung food, screamed, fought and tried to defecate on the floor, according to records of 568 emergency calls over 13 months, many depicting scenes of mayhem.
“Male w/machete is back,” the report on one 911 call states. “Another security guard was just assaulted,” another says. A man with a 4-inch knife attacked several security guards, then sprayed store employees with foam from a fire extinguisher, according to a third.
In September, a 30-year-old man died in the bathroom from an overdose of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, and methamphetamine.
When Whole Foods announced in mid-April that it was closing the store, citing the safety of its employees, many in San Francisco saw it as a representation of some of the city’s most intractable problems: property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins, an entrenched network of dealers selling fentanyl and other illicit drugs and people suffering from untreated mental illness wandering the streets.
The closure also seemed to be the latest indicator of San Francisco’s faltering economic prospects, providing more grist for an ongoing debate over where the city is headed after tying its fate to the tech industry. The Whole Foods was supposed to cater to tech workers and other professionals, part of a long-term redevelopment plan downtown. But the store fell victim to a grinding decline in the city’s center that began with the pandemic and could continue for years as companies vacate offices because of remote work.
In a city famous for its boom-and-bust cycles, San Francisco’s continued slump has left residents in a sour mood, angry at city leaders and waiting for the sparks of revitalization. Now, largely because the tech industry has so wholeheartedly embraced work-from-home, activity in San Francisco’s downtown remains at roughly one-third of pre-pandemic levels — lower than in about 50 other major cities, according to one new study that used cellphone data as a measure.
“This is going to be a very slow recovery,” Effi Shoua said this month from behind his desk at the downtown fine art gallery he owns in Union Square. The area is a prime spot for tourists, who have been steadily returning to the city, a bright spot and a contrast to the 26% vacancy rate of downtown offices.
Many merchants are worried about a domino effect of commercial failures if office workers are permanently absent for about half of the week, while people using drugs, going through mental crises or living on the street remain more visible than ever.
The impact on the city’s budget is significant, too: Office-based industries account for nearly three quarters of the city’s gross domestic product. After years of surpluses, the government now forecasts a $780 million deficit in the upcoming two fiscal years — roughly a 6% cut in its general fund, according to the mayor’s office.
City officials say they are searching for ways to diversify the economy and to reduce homelessness and drug dealing. They realize that some of the largest local employers, Big Tech companies, will not be towing San Francisco from its economic shoals. Twitter, Google, Facebook and Salesforce, all of which have offices in the city, have laid off thousands of workers.
San Francisco leaders point out that the city has rebounded again and again, including after the near-collapse of the tech industry in 2000 and the national recession about eight years later.
“We’ve been counted out before, and there have been others who have tried to imply because things aren’t happening as fast or the way that they think it should happen, that it’s over,” London Breed, the city’s mayor, said in an interview.
In the famously liberal city, where Republicans make up just 7% of the electorate, moderate Democrats like Breed are calling for aggressive steps to address public safety concerns while progressive voices decry law-and-order strategies as knee-jerk responses that trample on the vulnerable.
City leaders face some limitations. A federal judge in April determined that San Francisco cannot clear homeless people from public spaces because it has not done enough to provide shelter. Breed is backing bills in the state Legislature that would make it easier to force mentally ill people into treatment. The mayor has also proposed addressing homelessness by building more: slashing the permitting process for construction with the goal of building 83,000 additional homes and apartments — a 20% increase from the city’s current total housing stock — in eight years.
Even though the downtown is plastered with “for lease” signs, the city’s unemployment rate is under 3% and the mayor and other officials say the engineering talent pool remains the city’s top asset. And there is much more to San Francisco than its downtown. It has always been a constellation of very different neighborhoods, some of which have very few of the social ills that afflict the area near the closed Whole Foods.
Officials add that the downtown may ultimately emerge more resilient if it attracts industries like life sciences and biotech whose employees still need work space. There is growth in the tech industry, too: The development of artificial intelligence, which promises to transform the way that people live and work, is centered in San Francisco.
Garry Tan, the president of Y Combinator, a prominent venture-capital company, says he sees signs of renewal in San Francisco. “It’s the gold rush over and over and over again,” he said.
Tan is part of a generation of tech workers who are more assertive in their demands on city officials, unafraid to take sides in the city’s internecine politics and funding organizations that press for more emphasis on public safety.
“Now the narrative out there for some of the founders in our community is, I’m not sure if I feel safe here. I’m not sure if I want to stay here. The quality of life issues are the question. Can I raise a family here?”
In early April, some tech leaders seized upon the recent fatal stabbing downtown of Bob Lee, a prominent industry executive, as an alarming sign that the downtown was unsafe. But an acquaintance was later accused of murder, and San Francisco’s murder rate is quite low compared with other major cities. Overall, police statistics show fewer property and violent crimes in 2022 than in 2018, before the pandemic began.
Still, Bill Scott, the city’s police chief, says many residents complain that they feel less safe, and the open-air drug use, much of it tied to fentanyl, is a major contributor.
Matt Dorsey, a member of the board of supervisors who lives steps away from the shuttered Whole Foods, said recent elections had signaled a shift in voter priorities. He pointed to last year’s recall of the city’s progressive district attorney, Chesa Boudin, who was replaced by a prosecutor who vowed to be tougher on crime.
“San Francisco is in the midst of a voter revolt on public safety,” Dorsey said. In a poll conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle in September, nearly two-thirds of respondents said life in the city was worse off than when they moved here.
The new district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, has begun prosecuting more drug crimes than Boudin, but the city experienced a 40% jump in fatal overdoses in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. Citing that statistic, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday authorized an antidrug task force in San Francisco that will include members of the California National Guard and California Highway Patrol.
The mayor and the police chief have vowed to hire hundreds of additional officers, which would expand the force by more than one-fourth, a difficult proposition when law enforcement agencies nationwide are facing shortages.
Not everyone is on board with that.
Dean Preston, a member of the board of supervisors who was reelected in 2020 on a Democratic Socialist platform, is against increasing police staffing and believes the idea of a shift in the electorate’s view about public safety is overstated.
“There’s been a massive propaganda effort to change public opinion around policing and public safety,” he said.
Preston uses his district as an example of how uneven the pandemic recovery has been. Some areas like Japantown and Haight Ashbury are thriving, he said. Others like the Tenderloin, which is adjacent to the shuttered Whole Foods, are beset by drug dealing and homelessness.
One of the next big tests for downtown might be this summer’s expected opening of an Ikea store not far from the Whole Foods site.
Police described theft as rampant at Whole Foods, with thieves walking out with armfuls of alcohol, at least at the start. After 250 shopping hand baskets were stolen, the company restocked with 50 more. Those went missing, too.
During the store’s 13 months in operation, at least 14 people were arrested, including on charges of grand theft and battery, according to official reports. Scott said that plainclothes officers were sent there and security improved over time, but seemingly not enough for the company.
On a recent chilly night across from the shuttered store, Joseph Peterson, a former construction worker who lost both of his legs to diabetes and is homeless, rolled down the sidewalk in his wheelchair. Peterson could see the 2,000-unit Trinity apartments, the high-end complex that Whole Foods had hoped would be its customer base. Across the intersection, security guards stood sentry in front of the Orpheum Theater, where “Pretty Woman: The Musical” was playing. A few dozen steps away, dealers peddled fentanyl and crystal meth.
Peterson said he understood why Whole Foods had closed the store.
“People kept stealing from it,” he said. He, too, had taken macaroni and cheese and chicken from the hot food bar a number of times, he said. But he made a distinction. Other people stole from the store because they wanted to resell what they took.
“I just stole to eat,” he said.

Prosecutors in Jan. 6 Case Take a Closer Look at Trump's Fund-Raising: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Justice Department has been gathering evidence about whether the former president and his allies solicited donations with claims of election fraud they knew to be false.
As they investigate former President Donald J. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, federal prosecutors have also been drilling down on whether Mr. Trump and a range of political aides knew that he had lost the race but still raised money off claims that they were fighting widespread fraud in the vote results, according to three people familiar with the matter.
Led by the special counsel Jack Smith, prosecutors are trying to determine whether Mr. Trump and his aides violated federal wire fraud statutes as they raised as much as $ 250 million through a political action committee by saying they needed the money to fight to reverse election fraud even though they had been told repeatedly that there was no evidence to back up those fraud claims.
The prosecutors are looking at the inner workings of the committee, Save America PAC, and at the Trump campaign's efforts to prove its baseless case that Mr. Trump had been cheated out of victory.
In the past several months, prosecutors have issued multiple batches of subpoenas in a wide-ranging effort to understand Save America, which was set up shortly after the election as Mr. Trump's main fund-raising entity. An initial round of subpoenas, which started going out before Mr. Trump declared his candidacy in the 2024 race and Mr. Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick B. Garland in November, focused on various Republican officials and vendors that had received payments from Save America.
But more recently, investigators have homed in on the activities of a joint fund-raising committee made up of staff members from the 2020 Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, among others. Some of the subpoenas have sought documents from around Election Day 2020 up the present.
Prosecutors have been heavily focused on details of the campaign's finances, spending and fund-raising, such as who was approving email solicitations that were blasted out to lists of possible small donors and what they knew about the truth of the fraud claims, according to the people familiar with their work. All three areas overlap, and could inform prosecutors' thinking about whether to proceed with charges in an investigation in which witnesses are still being interviewed.
The possibility that the fund-raising efforts might have been criminally fraudulent was first raised last year by the House select committee investigating Mr. Trump's efforts to retain power.
But the Justice Department, with its ability to bring criminal charges, has been able to prompt more extensive cooperation from a number of witnesses. And prosecutors have developed more information than the House committee did, having targeted communications between Trump campaign aides and other Republican officials to determine if a barrage of fund-raising solicitations sent out after the election were knowingly misleading, according to the three people familiar with the matter.
The fund-raising efforts are just one focus of Mr. Smith's investigation into Mr. Trump's attempts to reverse his loss at the polls.
Prosecutors have also been examining the plan to assemble alternate slates of pro-Trump electors from swing states won by Joseph R. Biden Jr., and the broader push by Mr. Trump to block or delay congressional certification of Mr. Biden's Electoral College victory on Jan. 6, 2021, leading to the storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters.
On Thursday, former Vice President Mike Pence, a key witness to Mr. Trump's efforts, testified for hours to the grand jury gathering evidence in the investigation.
Prosecutors have been looking at the nexus between research the Trump campaign commissioned almost immediately after the election to try to prove widespread fraud, public statements that he and his allies made at the time, the fund-raising efforts and the establishment of Save America.
The Washington Post reported earlier on the efforts by the campaign to fund research into claims of fraud and the new round of subpoenas.
Mr. Trump's team may argue that the fund-raising represented political speech with solicitations that were generally vague, and that subjecting it to a criminal process could raise First Amendment issues and create a slippery slope for future candidates. Political fund-raising materials often engage in bombast or exaggeration.
Republicans may also argue that Democrats have been loose in claims they have used in fund-raising solicitations. And the Trump campaign may argue that it did in fact use the funds to try to investigate fraud.
A Trump campaign adviser said the "deep state" was ramping up its attacks on the former president as his poll numbers rose. "The 'political police' have been pushing their witch hunt since President Trump came down the escalator, and they've been proven wrong every single time," the adviser added.
Officials with the Republican National Committee declined to comment.
Immediately after the election, an adviser to the Trump campaign reached out to Ken Block, the owner of a Rhode Island-based firm, Simpatico Software Systems, to have him evaluate specific allegations of fraud.
Mr. Block ended up researching multiple claims of possible fraud that Mr. Trump's aides brought to him. He never produced a final report. But each time he investigated a claim, he said in an interview, he found there was nothing to it.
Mr. Block said he had disproved "everything that came in and found no substantive fraud sufficient to overturn an election result." He said he was isolated from what was taking place within the campaign, as Mr. Trump railed at aides about staying in office and continued to insist he had won an election that he was repeatedly told he had lost.
"I was kept very walled off from all of the insanity," said Mr. Block, whose firm was paid $ 735,000, records show. He received a subpoena for documents, but declined in the interview to discuss anything related to the grand jury.
Days after starting to work with Mr. Block and Simpatico, the Trump campaign hired a second firm, the Berkeley Research Group. The federal grand jury has received evidence that Berkeley was hired at the suggestion of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, who was overseeing the political operation.
The grand jury has been asking questions related to whether Mr. Trump was briefed on findings by Berkeley suggesting there had been no widespread fraud.
The company ultimately submitted a report indicating there had been no fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election, and was paid roughly $ 600,000 for its work. The company was hired through a law firm that has long represented Mr. Trump in his personal capacity, Kasowitz Benson Torres, although lawyers there were not involved in pursuing Mr. Trump's election fraud claims, according to a person briefed on the matter.
A deputy counsel for Berkeley Research Group said the company has a "no comment" policy and declined to discuss the matter further.
During the House Jan. 6 committee's proceedings last year, several people close to Mr. Trump testified that they had informed him that there had been no fraud sufficient to change the outcome of the voting.
Within two weeks of the election, the Trump campaign's own communications staff drafted an internal report debunking many aspects of a conspiracy theory that voting machines made by Dominion Voting Systems had been hacked and used to flip votes away from Mr. Trump. That report was written before pro-Trump lawyers like Sidney Powell and Rudolph W. Giuliani promoted the false Dominion story at news conferences and on television.
As part of its investigation into the Trump campaign's postelection fund-raising, the Jan. 6 panel subpoenaed records from Salesforce.com, a vendor that helped the campaign and the Republican National Committee send emails to potential donors. The R.N.C. fought back, filing a lawsuit to quash the subpoena, and the House committee ultimately withdrew it.
In the latest round of subpoenas, federal prosecutors have sought documents related to Salesforce in addition to other vendors, according to a person briefed on the matter.

One Start-Up Thinks Text Messages Could Be Next Social Media: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Community, which was first marketed as a way for celebrities to text their fans, now has big brands on board.
Andrew here. You probably received today's DealBook newsletter, as you always do, by email. But you probably got a bunch of spam and junk mail in your inbox, too.
That's why so many of us are moving our most important communications to text messages. And in the process, the "text inbox" has become the new holy space for brands, far more intimate than your social media feed.
At least, that's the bet that Ashton Kutcher, the actor turned venture capitalist, and Guy Oseary, Bono's and Madonna's manager turned investor, made when they co-founded a text message company called Community in 2019. In the beginning, it was marketed to celebrities to communicate with their fans about tour dates and new projects.
But over the last year, the business has quietly grown to power text messages from some of the largest brands, like McDonald's, HBO, the New York Yankees and Condé Nast. When this month's Hollywood blockbuster, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," launched an advertising campaign, it came with a phone number for viewers to text, powered by Community.
The company plans to announce next week that it has raised another $ 25 million, bringing its total fund-raising to $ 110 million, from investors such as Salesforce Ventures, Morgan Stanley Next Level Fund and Verizon Ventures. (It did not disclose its latest valuation.)
It also made Robert Wolf, a former chairman of UBS Group Americas, who served as an informal adviser to President Barack Obama, its new chairman. He started helping to sign up large corporate customers over the past year, bringing the total clients to over 8,000. The company is run by Diankha Linear, a longtime executive who served as an Army logistics and transportation officer.
Community has gained its latest funding as questions have increasingly arisen about social media's reach and how companies can own the digital relationship with their customers without a middleman like Facebook or Twitter.
"I started out with Twitter and built a fairly large following on Twitter," said Mr. Kutcher, who has 16.8 million followers. "But Twitter today is very different than what Twitter was when I originally started playing around it," he added. "The click-through rates are massively degraded -- the number of people that actually see the post is massively degraded."
At Community, in contrast, "we have like 45 percent click-through rates and 98 percent open rates," Mr. Kutcher said. "You don't get that in social environments because most people don't even see the things you're posting."
Community competes with a bevy of different types of services vying for space in your text inbox, from Attentive to Twilio to Zendesk. And many of the software platforms that companies use to manage their relationships with customers now have features that facilitate texting.
But what sets Community apart is the dialogue that celebrities and brands have with their customers, who provide troves of information about themselves, which the brand owns and isn't shared with Community's other clients.
Oseary was originally drawn to Community because of his role as a music manager, he said.
"I have no way to know who came to the concert tonight. I have no way to speak to them again once they leave the concert. I have no way to know who bought the album," he said. "With Community, once they text the number, we now have a way to stay in touch directly. And that information is not owned by anyone but the artist, the talent or the person who's building a business."
Companies advertise a phone number that users text to sign up for updates. McDonald's posted its number on a billboard in Times Square just this month. The service also allows brands to segment customers who sign up for texts, so if an artist has an concert coming up in Atlanta, only people in Atlanta get the texts.
Using text messages to connect with customers, for all its promise, poses unique challenges. Brands are required to get their customers to opt in to messages, which is hard to do unless the brand is already well established. And customers may want to hear from fewer brands in their text inbox than they do in their email inbox.
"As opposed to email, when you have to scroll to the bottom of the thing and hit the link that says unsubscribe, if you don't like the text messages you're getting, you only have to write one word: Stop," Mr. Kutcher said. (That's some news you can use.)
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Rupert Murdoch makes another deal. Fox News settled a defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems at the last minute for $ 788 billion. The deal allowed Murdoch and his company's executives to avoid having to testify, but it also handed Staple Street, the private equity owner of Dominion, a big payday after it bought the company for $ 38 million in 2018. His son Lachlan, C.E.O. of Fox Corporation, also settled a separate defamation suit against an Australian publisher this week.
Return to sender. Netflix ended its DVD delivery service after 25 years. The streaming company's original business model revolved around sending discs by mail, and at its peak, in 2010, about 20 million subscribers used the service. The company announced the changes as it reported first-quarter profits of $ 1.3 billion, up 4 percent year on year.
Gary Gensler gets a grilling. The chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was hammered by Republicans over the agency's handling of the cryptocurrency industry, in an appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. Gensler defended the regulator, saying he had never seen a sector break so many securities laws with such regularity, after being accused of failing to spot problems at FTX before the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed.
China's economy bounces back, kind of. In its first full quarter since Beijing lifted punishing Covid restrictions, the world's second-largest economy beat expectations on the back of surging consumer spending, rising exports and government-led infrastructure spending. But youth unemployment hit 19.6 percent, its second-highest mark on record, suggesting that businesses are not convinced that Beijing is finished dabbling in the private sector and that economic uncertainty is over.
Goldman Sachs quickens its retail banking U-turn. The Wall Street giant reported lackluster first-quarter returns and accelerated its retreat from consumer banking, including putting its GreenSky unit up for sale just a year after buying the lending company for $ 2.2 billion. One spot of new business: The bank introduced a savings account with Apple that offers a 4.15 percent annual interest rate -- more than 10 times the national average.
BMW gets into hot water over ice cream. The German carmaker was forced to apologize after being accused of discriminating against Chinese visitors to the Shanghai auto show this week. Images went viral on Chinese social media of workers at its booth appearing to give free ice cream to a western man after telling ethnic Chinese attendees that they had run out.
Term of the week: 'Greenhushing'
Ever since Earth Day was established in 1970, companies have advertised their green initiatives on April 22. But with many Republicans now taking a strong stand against corporate environmentalism and targeting companies that publicize their climate change-related goals, you might see fewer companies touting their green credentials this year. Instead, some businesses are resorting to "greenhushing." An analysis of 1,200 companies published last fall by South Pole, a Swiss consultancy, found that one in four planned to go green but then "go dark" -- that is, keep its green goals under the radar.
A.I., the artist
Artificial intelligence has had a creative few weeks: A song that used A.I. to mimic the voices of Drake and The Weeknd went viral; a murder-mystery novel penned using A.I. is available to preorder; and an image generated by A.I. won one of the world's biggest photography prizes. DealBook wrote last week that A.I. was creating thorny copyright issues, but it is also raising questions about the nature of human creativity itself.
Companies have tried to draw lines between human and machine-generated work. Streaming services, including Spotify and Apple Music, pulled the tech-created song from their platforms this week. And Universal Music Group urged the services to block A.I. from scraping its songs for use as training data.
Some artists see creative possibilities rather than threats. Stephen Marche, who wrote the cheekily titled "Death of an Author" novel using three A.I. programs, compared the process to composing hip-hop: "You don't necessarily know how to drum, but you definitely need to know how beats work, how hooks work, and you need to be able to put them together in a meaningful way," he told The New York Times. "I am the creator of this work, 100 percent," Marche said, "but, on the other hand, I didn't create the words."
Who is the creator? Boris Eldagsen, the Berlin artist whose A.I.-generated "Pseudomnesia: The Electrician" won the creative open category at the Sony World Photography Awards, told DealBook that making the image had been like directing a film.
"On a movie there is a set director, there is a cameraman, and there is an actress and a story writer, and I tell them which direction to go," he said. "I am the one, as an artist, who needs to connect all of this to the world, the human condition."
He entered the competition to kick-start a conversation about separating the art of photography from A.I.-generated art, which he considers co-creation.
But who should take credit for this type of collaboration? Generative A.I. is informed by reference material created by human artists. It becomes more complicated when A.I. is used to imitate a particular performer, or a specific artist's drawing style. Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America launched a "human artistry campaign," which argues that the makers of A.I. need to license copyrighted work they use as training data. And Holly Herndon, a musician, started a company to build consent guidelines for the tech. "The creative possibilities there are fascinating and will change art forever," she told The Times. "We just have to figure out the terms and tech."

Killing of Entrepreneur Provokes Fierce Debate Over Policies on Crime: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some influential tech executives said Mr. Lee's death reflected a city overrun by crime, but few have reversed course since the arrest of a man who knew the victim.
SAN FRANCISCO -- After the stabbing death last week of Bob Lee, an entrepreneur and creator of Cash App, in a San Francisco neighborhood popular among technology workers, prominent tech executives including Elon Musk tore into the city's leaders.
Matt Ocko, a venture capitalist, said San Francisco officials had Mr. Lee's "literal blood on their hands." Others suggested that homelessness and violence run amok were to blame.
But that narrative was upended on Thursday when the police arrested Nima Momeni, who they said knew Mr. Lee and worked in the same industry. Ever since Mr. Momeni was identified, other voices in the tech world have hit back at those who used Mr. Lee's death to malign the city on social media.
"I suspect we'll find that this story doesn't represent anything universal about the great city of San Francisco," said Jeff Lawson, chief executive of the tech communications company Twilio, whose offices are just a few blocks from where Mr. Lee was killed. "Rather, it is a tragic aberration, the result of an interpersonal conflict -- the kind that can happen in any city and time."
Mr. Lee was killed in an upscale neighborhood called Rincon Hill, which sits between Oracle Park, home of the San Francisco Giants, and a quiet area near the bay that houses offices for companies like Google, Meta and Salesforce. San Francisco was a city he loved, Mr. Lee's brother, Oliver Lee, said on Thursday, adding that the moves to critique the city in light of his death "wouldn't have been like him."
As news of his killing spread last week, some technology entrepreneurs and venture capitalists based in the Bay Area concluded that San Francisco's approach to crime and homelessness had led to his death. Many of them blamed San Francisco's board of supervisors and Chesa Boudin, the former district attorney who was ousted in a recall vote last year.
Jason Calacanis, a tech investor and podcaster, tweeted a video of Kevin Benedicto, a San Francisco police commissioner, in which the official cautioned against falling into a "preconceived narrative" about a "horrifying act of violence."
"THESE ARE THE LUNATICS RUNNING SAN FRANCISCO," Mr. Calacanis wrote with the video. "EVIL INCOMPETENT FOOLS & GRIFTERS WHO ACCOMPLISH NOTHING EXCEPT ENABLING RAMPANT VIOLENCE."
The pile-on continued last Friday on a technology podcast hosted by Mr. Calacanis and other venture capitalists. On the show, David Sacks, founder and partner of Craft Ventures, said he would "bet dollars to dimes" that Mr. Lee's killing was like a case in Los Angeles where "a young woman was basically stabbed for no reason by a psychotic homeless person."
Mr. Musk, the billionaire head of Twitter, which is based in San Francisco, concurred "absolutely" with Mr. Sacks's sentiments in a reply to his tweet. Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
Brooke Jenkins, the San Francisco district attorney, slammed Mr. Musk on Thursday, specifically calling his tweets on Mr. Lee's death "reckless and irresponsible." National crime data shows that rates of violent crime have dipped or held steady over the past several years in the city of more than 800,000 people, and that the murder rate in 2020 was low compared with that of other major American cities.
The city, however, has experienced a rise in property crimes since 2020, along with a visible growth in homeless encampments and drug use in public areas, all factors that were emphasized last year during the campaign to recall Mr. Boudin. After his removal, he was replaced by Ms. Jenkins, who had criticized her predecessor as being too lenient on criminals.
On Thursday, Mr. Calacanis, when asked if he had changed his mind about the situation after the arrest of Mr. Momeni, said by email, "When was the last time you walked a mile in San Francisco? Do you think it is safe?"
Asked again to elaborate on his position, he explained that it had not changed. "The press trying to make this into a 'gotcha' situation is just pathetic," Mr. Calacanis said.
He added that he had watched "San Francisco go from the No. 1 destination for founders and senior executives to the bottom of the list. The No. 1 reason given is crime and violence."
Mr. Sacks did not respond to a request for comment, but his spokeswoman sent a link to a podcast, which was published early Friday, in which he and Mr. Calacanis defended their earlier assessments that unsafe conditions in San Francisco were to blame for Mr. Lee's death. On the recording, Mr. Sacks said his bet that Mr. Lee was killed by an unhoused person was "logical."
Some tech workers and venture capitalists struck back at their narrative after the arrest, and the snap judgments made by others who implicated the city.
"The same people who purchased a recall based on their racist lies have been telling lies about how Bob died, all to further their political agenda," Anil Dash, a tech entrepreneur, wrote, referring to the ouster of Mr. Boudin.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Dash called himself an acquaintance of Mr. Lee who was familiar with the slain man's zeal for San Francisco. "He didn't want to see San Francisco demonized," Mr. Dash said. "To contradict the man's values and use it for political gain for things he did not agree with is the height of cynicism."
Brett Ashton, 56, who is Black and has worked for tech companies in the Bay Area for more than 30 years, said that he was not surprised by Mr. Musk's comments, given what the Tesla chief and Twitter owner had said in the past. But he said he felt that Mr. Calacanis had crossed over into new territory by blaming the local community.
"Their comments are very much about Black people and brown people and people that don't look like them," he said in an interview. "They are just pushing a narrative that tech bros are being victimized by a dystopian hellscape."
San Francisco prosecutors said in a court document on Friday that Mr. Momeni, 38, stabbed Mr. Lee, 43, on a secluded street in San Francisco in the early hours of April 4 and then sped off in his sports car.
The two men had argued earlier in the evening over whether anything "inappropriate" had happened between Mr. Lee and Mr. Momeni's sister, prosecutors said. A lawyer for Mr. Momeni, Paula Canny, said that "romance" was not involved.
Some in the technology industry did not try to make political statements after Mr. Lee's death, but instead memorialized what he had done for San Francisco. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Block, the developer of the Square payments system, recalled in an internal email last week seen by The New York Times that Mr. Lee helped pick up trash around the company's office off Market Street.
It was on one of those cleanups that he and Mr. Lee conceived the idea for Cash App, the company's popular peer-to-peer mobile payments app, Mr. Dorsey wrote. Mr. Lee sent the first Cash App transaction to Mr. Dorsey in August 2013.
Oliver Lee said on Thursday that his family was still grieving, and that the politicization of his brother's death had added to their emotional burden.
"We're focused on healing and Bob's legacy, and making sure people remember him for who he was," he said. "First we lost him. And then all this crazy attention. It's been hard."

Mass Layoffs and Absentee Bosses Lead to a Morale Crisis at Meta: [Correction]

Full text: Workers at Facebook's parent have been increasingly alarmed by job cuts and the company's direction.
"Raise your hand if you know who is getting fired?" a Meta employee wrote in an online chat group for the company's engineers this month. "Fire emoji if you think it's a dumpster fire."
In response, his colleagues posted dozens of tiny flame emojis.
"I'm already fired," added a former Meta employee who worked in the company's business division for nearly four years before most of his team was laid off this year. "But who can keep track?"
Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's chief executive, has declared that 2023 will be the "year of efficiency" at his company. So far, efficiency has translated into mass layoffs. He has conducted two rounds of cuts over the past six months, with two more to come; these will eliminate more than 21,000 people. Mr. Zuckerberg is also closing 5,000 open positions, which amounts to 30 percent of his company's work force.
At the same time, some of Meta's top executives have moved away and are managing large parts of the Silicon Valley company from their new homes in places like London and Tel Aviv.
The layoffs and absentee leadership, along with concerns that Mr. Zuckerberg is making a bad bet on the future, have devastated employee morale at Meta, according to nine current and former employees, as well as messages reviewed by The New York Times.
Employees at Meta, which not long ago was one of the most desirable workplaces in Silicon Valley, face an increasingly precarious future. The company's stock price has dropped 43 percent from its peak 19 months ago. More layoffs, Mr. Zuckerberg has said on his Facebook page, are coming this month. Some of those cuts could be in engineering groups, which would have been unthinkable before the trouble started last year, two employees said.
"So many of the employees feel like they're in limbo right now," said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. "They're saying it's 'Hunger Games' meets 'Lord of the Flies,' where everyone is trying to prove their worth to management."
Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is not the only big tech company that has hit the brakes on spending. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and others have laid off thousands of workers in recent months, shed office space, dropped perks and pulled back from experimental initiatives.
But Meta appears to face the most challenges. Last year, the company reported consecutive quarters of declining revenue -- a first since it became a public company in 2012.
While Meta's peers are chasing a wave of innovation in artificial intelligence, Mr. Zuckerberg has made a big bet on the metaverse, an immersive online world. But it is unclear if consumers will embrace his vision in the way he hopes. While the company has sold 20 million virtual reality headsets -- more than any other company producing similar tech -- it has struggled to keep customers returning regularly to use the product.
Many workers at Meta had already been skeptical of Mr. Zuckerberg's shift toward the metaverse. Those concerns have grown as consumer enthusiasm for the virtual world has lagged, the employees said.
The absence of many top executives from Meta's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., is compounding worries. Mr. Zuckerberg, 38, is on parental leave after the birth of his third child, three Meta employees said, but is regularly meeting with executives on important topics. (A.I. is at the top of that list.)
Even though Mr. Zuckerberg has encouraged rank-and-file employees to return to the company's headquarters, several of his top lieutenants have moved away.
Naomi Gleit, one of Meta's first employees and now head of product, recently moved to New York, joining three other senior Meta managers and executives based there. Guy Rosen, Meta's chief information security officer, moved back to Tel Aviv, where he lived when his company, Onavo, was acquired. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, is living in London. And Javier Olivan, Meta's chief operating officer, is splitting his time between Europe and Silicon Valley.
While the executives have been joining Meta's weekly meetings through video chats, their absence from the Menlo Park offices has been felt, employees said, especially since Mr. Zuckerberg recently stressed that he expected employees to return to the office.
A spokesman for Meta said its executives continued to travel regularly to the Silicon Valley offices.
Within Meta, there is pressure to demonstrate that people are working hard, two employees said. Intense scrutiny has come in recent workplace reviews. Workers, especially in middle management, are being asked to justify why their jobs are crucial to Meta's goals.
Some employees are trying to make themselves look busier, two people said. That has made people more possessive about their work, the people said, which has meant less collaborating with co-workers. One person described the atmosphere as "cutthroat."
Meta declined to comment on internal matters.
While the first two rounds of layoffs largely affected business and recruiting teams, the cuts expected this month will focus on tech departments, including engineers, which has surprised employees, said four employees, who were not authorized to speak to reporters. Insiders expect engineering cuts to hit teams inside WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, they said.
In one of his regular question-and-answer sessions with employees this year, Mr. Zuckerberg said that there was no "perfect way to do" layoffs, and that he wanted to err on the side of providing more information about upcoming layoffs as news of the cuts began to leak to the press. The Information previously reported on the meeting.
Meta employees have created memes and inside jokes about how much time workers have left. In messaging groups and workplace chats in recent weeks, they have been using skull-and-bones emojis to signal to one another that they may be part of the layoffs, according to screenshots seen by The Times.
Those remaining have griped about reduced bonuses and perks. One engineer created a bot that would automatically calculate the loss in the value of Meta stock held by employees, part of their compensation package.
The cutbacks include trimming Meta's real estate. The company has terminated leases for offices across the Bay Area, including space in San Francisco, Fremont, Sunnyvale and Menlo Park, according to two people familiar with the cuts. In February, the company announced that it would pay to end leases early and cut Meta's real estate contracts in some areas.
The company is also cutting back on some of its lavish perks, once considered necessary to attract top talent. Last year, Meta ended its free laundry service for employees and pushed dinner service later into the evening -- a way to cut down on workers' loading up free food to take home.
Workers complained in internal chat rooms that the company was cutting back on amenities. One was frustrated that there was no more cereal in the worker's office, and that snacks in "micro-kitchens" were not being restocked as regularly. Many believed that cafeteria options had gone downhill.
Employee travel expenses are also being scrutinized more closely, and workers have been asked to cut down on nonessential travel.
At WhatsApp, Meta's popular messaging product, insiders are anticipating fewer cuts and structural changes on the business side than in the rest of the company, two current employees said. Mr. Zuckerberg wants to increase the cadence of delivering new, revenue-generating features in WhatsApp, which he bought nine years ago for $ 19 billion.
While employees complain they aren't hearing enough from Mr. Zuckerberg, he still surprised some this year when he dropped into a discussion group for Metamates, the name given to employees.
Workers were gossiping about a recent news article that noted Sergey Brin and Larry Page's return to Google to assist with the company's artificial intelligence strategy, two employees who witnessed the exchange said. One worker joked how the founders' return might inspire Mr. Zuckerberg to get back to coding at Facebook.
Later, Mr. Zuckerberg replied to the employees, who didn't know he was lurking in the discussion.
"I never left," he wrote.

SAN FRANCISCO — “Raise your hand if you know who is getting fired?” a Meta employee wrote in an online chat group for the company’s engineers this month. “Fire emoji if you think it’s a dumpster fire.”
In response, his colleagues posted dozens of tiny flame emojis.
“I’m already fired,” added a former Meta employee who worked in the company’s business division for nearly four years before most of his team was laid off this year. “But who can keep track?”
Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO, has declared that 2023 will be the “year of efficiency” at his company. So far, efficiency has translated into mass layoffs. He has conducted two rounds of cuts over the last six months, eliminating more than 26,000 people, or nearly 30% of his company’s workforce.
At the same time, some of Meta’s top executives have moved away and are managing large parts of the Silicon Valley company from their new homes in places like London and Tel Aviv, Israel.
The layoffs and absentee leadership, along with concerns that Zuckerberg is making a bad bet on the future, have devastated employee morale at Meta, according to nine current and former employees, as well as messages reviewed by The New York Times.
Employees at Meta, which not long ago was one of the most desirable workplaces in Silicon Valley, face an increasingly precarious future. The company’s stock price has dropped 43% from its peak 19 months ago. More layoffs, Zuckerberg has said on his Facebook page, are coming this month. And for the first time, some of those cuts could be in engineering groups, which would have been unthinkable before the trouble started last year, two employees said.
“So many of the employees feel like they’re in limbo right now,” said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. “They’re saying it’s ‘Hunger Games’ meets ‘Lord of the Flies,’ where everyone is trying to prove their worth to management.”
Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is not the only big tech company that has hit the brakes on spending. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and others have laid off thousands of workers in recent months, shed office space, dropped perks and pulled back from experimental initiatives.
But Meta appears to face the most challenges. Last year, the company reported consecutive quarters of declining revenue — a first since it became a public company in 2012.
While Meta’s peers are chasing a wave of innovation in artificial intelligence, Zuckerberg has made a big bet on the metaverse, an immersive online world. But it is unclear if consumers will embrace his vision in the way he hopes. While the company has sold 20 million virtual reality headsets — more than any other company producing similar tech — it has struggled to keep customers returning regularly to use the product.
Many workers at Meta had already been skeptical of Zuckerberg’s shift toward the metaverse. Those concerns have grown as consumer enthusiasm for the virtual world has lagged, the employees said.
The absence of many top executives from Meta’s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, is compounding worries. Zuckerberg, 38, is on parental leave after the birth of his third child, three Meta employees said, but is regularly meeting with executives on important topics. (AI is at the top of that list.)
Even though Zuckerberg has encouraged rank-and file employees to return to the company’s headquarters, several of his top lieutenants have moved away.
Naomi Gleit, one of Meta’s first employees and now head of product, recently moved to New York, joining three other senior Meta managers and executives based there. Guy Rosen, Meta’s chief information security officer, moved back to Tel Aviv, where he lived when his company, Onavo, was acquired. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, is living in London. And Javier Olivan, Meta’s chief operating officer, is splitting his time between Europe and Silicon Valley.
While the executives have been joining Meta’s weekly meetings through video chats, their absence from the Menlo Park offices has been felt, employees said, especially since Zuckerberg recently stressed that he expected employees to return to the office.
A spokesperson for Meta said its executives continued to travel regularly to the Silicon Valley offices.
Within Meta, there is pressure to demonstrate that people are working hard, two employees said. Intense scrutiny has come in recent workplace reviews, which management consultancy firm Bain and Co. is assisting. Workers, especially in middle management, are being asked to justify why their jobs are crucial to Meta’s goals.
Some employees are trying to make themselves look busier, two people said. That has made people more possessive about their work, the people said, which has meant less collaborating with co-workers. One person described the atmosphere as “cutthroat.”

Fatal Stabbing Stirs Outrage Over 'Lawless' San Francisco: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bob Lee's death has stirred outrage among tech leaders and comes at a precarious time for the industry -- and the city it calls home.
The fury erupted within hours, as word spread that the 43-year-old man who had been stabbed to death this week in an enclave of high-rise condominiums near the Bay Bridge was Bob Lee, a well-known tech executive.
The leaders of "lawless" San Francisco had Mr. Lee's "literal blood on their hands," Matt Ocko, a tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist in Palo Alto, Calif., tweeted. "I hate what San Francisco has become," added Michael Arrington, the founder of the industry blog TechCrunch.
"Violent crime in SF is horrific," Elon Musk, the chief executive of Twitter and Tesla, chimed in.
The drumbeat has built since then in the liberal city that only last year recalled its progressive district attorney amid calls for law and order and deepening frustration over the city's homelessness crisis. While city officials agree that the murder is a terrifying tragedy and a signal that San Francisco has work to do on public safety, they're also clashing with powerful figures in the tech sector over the nature and severity of the city's problems with crime.
"A small minority has tried to weaponize this tragedy to advance a narrative about a crime wave that just isn't borne out by the data in San Francisco," Kevin Benedicto, a police commissioner and lawyer, said on Thursday. At a commission meeting earlier in the week, Mr. Benedicto complained that some on social media "are exploiting this horrific incident for political gain."
"There are real problems about crime that need to be addressed in San Francisco," he said in an interview. "But you're seeing people from tech, from certain political circles, who are trying to draw explicit connections to certain policies and elected officials when we don't even yet know the facts of the case."
The tension comes at a precarious time, as the tech industry implodes with layoffs and San Francisco itself struggles to bring visitors, conventions and legions of remote workers back to the too-quiet area in and around its downtown.
Office vacancy rates in the city of about 808,000 people stood at more than 27 percent at the end of last year and have only worsened, according to analyses by CBRE, a real estate broker. Restaurants where tech workers once lined up for lunch have had to adapt, essentially, to a customer base with a three-day workweek, as hybrid and remote work has become commonplace.
Even the weather has raised alarms, whipsawing from sunshine that frames the Golden Gate Bridge against blue skies in postcard perfection to fierce storms that have flattened tall trees throughout the city. During the last batch of atmospheric rivers, city officials warned San Franciscans to stay away from the Financial District, where high winds had shattered windows in office towers.
Police have released few details about Mr. Lee's death but have sought to reassure the public. "No one who commits a violent crime, or who's a repeat offender are receiving overly lenient plea deals," the new district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, said on Wednesday. The police chief, William Scott, reminded that "the investigation is still in the early stages."
But fears have been inflamed, particularly since a local online news organization founded by a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, The San Francisco Standard, reported that surveillance cameras had caught Mr. Lee staggering along the deserted street outside a high rise, clutching his wounds and calling for help. At one point in the harrowing footage, he appears to be stumbling toward a car, and then falling to the ground as the car drives away.
Mr. Benedicto, the police commissioner, confirmed on Thursday that he had seen the "heartbreaking" footage, but cautioned that the police had not formally confirmed the identity of the grainy figure.
Roy Bahat, the head of the venture firm Bloomberg Beta, said the crime could motivate the local tech community to become more involved in city politics.
"Is this the moment that tech will step in and take responsibility for the city that is its home?" he asked.
Mr. Lee, a software developer, had longstanding connections in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. He rose to prominence as the chief technology officer of the payment company Square, which changed its name to Block in 2021. He went on to join MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency start-up based in San Francisco, where he was chief product officer at the time of his death.
Colleagues said Mr. Lee, who had picked up the nickname "Crazy Bob" while playing water polo and continued using it as an online handle, was instrumental in creating the mobile payment service Cash App.
"He was drawn to big, transformational challenges, and through his work he changed the world of mobile payments for all of us," said Ron Conway, a prominent venture capitalist and political donor to local Democratic candidates. "His murder is a profound loss to the tech community, and my heart breaks for Bob's family."
In social media posts, Mr. Lee's father and brother wrote that Mr. Lee, a father of two, had recently relocated to Miami from the affluent Marin County community of Mill Valley, about 15 miles north of San Francisco. In interviews, close friends said the move had been inspired by the energy of Miami's tech community and not by disillusionment with the city where he had made much of his fortune.
"He felt like Miami was the next big thing," said Kyle Zink, a friend and collaborator who worked with Mr. Lee at Square and as a marketing consultant to MobileCoin. "He moved because he felt like there was a shift of talent and a shift of optimism."
Friends said he had continued to return frequently to San Francisco for business, and was wrapping up a short visit to the city on the night he was attacked. Around 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday, he collapsed on Main Street, where emergency medical workers found him bleeding from stab wounds, according to the police.
The stretch of sidewalk where he fell is lined with luxury high-rise condos and is home to the offices of a company that operates and leases data centers. The area is a tech hub, with the towering headquarters of Salesforce and Google's San Francisco offices just a short walk away.
Many tech employees live and work in the area, which caters to them with pour-over coffee shops, grab-and-go lunch counters and a specialty grocery store that attracts a lunchtime crowd with $ 12 sandwiches and salads. A nearby bus depot is a hub for commuters and tempts them to linger with a boba tea shop, a gyro stand and an outdoor cinema.
The neighborhood can feel empty after dark, and the community has pushed aggressively for more law enforcement, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, the city proposed opening a homeless shelter in the area, and residents protested, arguing that the facility -- which eventually did open -- would be detrimental to public safety.
Opposition to the shelter gathered momentum after a woman trying to enter her condo building was attacked that summer by a man suffering from mental illness, one of many seemingly random assaults that occurred in succession as the pandemic emptied public spaces.
Several residents of the neighborhood said the city appeared lately to be rebounding from the gritty years of Covid-19 lockdowns. But a bodega owner in the area said that crime seemed to be rising, and that at night, the neighborhood became a backdrop for drug use and occasional sideshows. He declined to be identified, citing fears that Mr. Lee's attacker had not been arrested and might return.
Scott Wiener, the state senator who represents the city, said the neighborhood, like many, "really took a hit during the pandemic," adding that his own car was burglarized there about a year and a half ago. But he added that while property crime and homelessness remained issues, violent crime was uncommon in most of the city.
"No one should listen to anything Elon Musk has to say, particularly about San Francisco," he said, calling the tech billionaire who bought Twitter "an opportunist who bought one of our anchor companies and proceeded to tear it apart."
Mr. Lee's death, he said, was a terrifying tragedy that deserved public attention and understandably unnerved the city, especially with no arrests. Crime statistics, he added, mean little when the victim is a loved one.
"But there's this narrative that all of San Francisco is like Mad Max Thunderdome," Mr. Wiener said, referring to the 1980s post-apocalyptic film, "and it's not true."
San Francisco recorded 56 homicides in 2017 before some violent crimes dipped during the pandemic; in 2021 and 2022, the homicide count was back up to 56, according to data from the city's Police Department.
Last month, the board of supervisors approved a request from Mayor London Breed to spend an additional $ 25 million on police overtime. She has said that the Police Department is understaffed.
"People have a right to expect better," said Matt Dorsey, a member of the board and a former communications director for the Police Department who represents the area where the attack happened. Everyone should be able to safely walk after dark in a city with as much nightlife as San Francisco, he said.
"A lot of the small businesses in the neighborhoods I represent depend on people coming here," he said. "And this doesn't help."

Opposition to the shelter gathered momentum after a woman trying to enter her condo building was attacked that summer by a man suffering from mental illness, one of many seemingly random assaults that occurred in succession as the pandemic emptied public spaces.
Several residents of the neighborhood said the city appeared lately to be rebounding from the gritty years of COVID-19 lockdowns. But a bodega owner in the area said that crime seemed to be rising and that at night, the neighborhood became a backdrop for drug use and occasional sideshows. He declined to be identified, citing fears that Lee’s attacker had not been arrested and might return.
Scott Wiener, the state senator who represents the city, said the neighborhood, like many, “really took a hit during the pandemic,” adding that his own car was burglarized there about a year and a half ago. But he added that while property crime and homelessness remained issues, violent crime was uncommon in most of the city.
“No one should listen to anything Elon Musk has to say, particularly about San Francisco,” he said, calling the tech billionaire who bought Twitter “an opportunist who bought one of our anchor companies and proceeded to tear it apart.”
Lee’s death, he said, was a terrifying tragedy that deserved public attention and understandably unnerved the city, especially with no arrests. Crime statistics, he added, mean little when the victim is a loved one.
“But there’s this narrative that all of San Francisco is like Mad Max Thunderdome,” Wiener said, referring to the 1980s postapocalyptic film, “and it’s not true.”
San Francisco recorded 56 homicides in 2017 before some violent crimes dipped during the pandemic; in 2021 and 2022, the homicide count was back up to 56, according to data from the city’s Police Department.
Last month, the board of supervisors approved a request from Mayor London Breed to spend an additional $25 million on police overtime. She has said that the Police Department is understaffed.
“People have a right to expect better,” said Matt Dorsey, a member of the board and a former communications director for the Police Department who represents the area where the attack happened. Everyone should be able to safely walk after dark in a city with as much nightlife as San Francisco, he said.
“A lot of the small businesses in the neighborhoods I represent depend on people coming here,” he said. “And this doesn’t help.”

Number of Remote Workers Is Debated: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New Labor Department numbers indicate that fewer Americans worked remotely last year. But many experts criticize the government's data collection.
Millions of workers, employers, square feet of real estate and dollars of downtown economic retail are wrapped up in the question of how many people are working from home -- yet there remain large discrepancies in how remote work is measured.
The Labor Department, last week, released data indicating a decline in remote work: 72.5 percent of businesses said their employees rarely or never teleworked last year, up from 60.1 percent in 2021 and quite close to the 76.7 percent that had no such work before the pandemic. But while the Labor Department found that remote work was almost back to prepandemic levels, many other surveys show it is up four- to fivefold.
Outside research, including a monthly survey of workers from researchers at Stanford University and the Census Bureau's household survey, indicate that remote work remains prevalent, with Stanford's finding that it accounts for over a quarter of paid full-time workdays in the United States, just slightly down from 33 percent in 2021. Some scholars suggested that the Labor Department's survey may overcount fully in-person work, though the comparisons among the various surveys aren't direct.
"I see this survey as an outlier and not the most reliable measure," said Adam Ozimek, chief economist of the Economic Innovation Group, a public policy organization, describing the Labor Department's survey. "We need to think hard as we try to develop better measures of working from home."
Remote work is having profound effects on nearly every dimension of the economy: foot traffic to downtown businesses, housing markets in big cities and far-flung areas, methods of assessing productivity and child care. Public transportation ridership sank during the pandemic, and suburban real estate values rose.
Nearly one billion square feet of office real estate was available but in search of a tenant at the end of 2022. People refashioned their lives and routines, working 28 percent more after traditional hours, according to Microsoft.
The stakes of measuring remote work's prevalence are high. And researchers said the wording of the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey on remote work, which was distributed to businesses, might have caused some confusion among respondents.
"Telework is a work arrangement that allows an employee to work at home, or from another remote location, by using the internet or a computer linked to one's place of employment, as well as digital communications, such as email and phone," the survey read. "Do any employees at this location CURRENTLY telework in any amount?"
By defining telework so broadly -- as any worker sending an email or making a call outside the office -- the Labor Department's survey question should most likely have turned up a fully in-person figure lower than the one released last week, said Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford, suggesting that some businesses may have been confused by the question.
This particular Labor Department figure on telework also combines fully remote work with hybrid arrangements. But hybrid work has eclipsed fully remote policies, with just over half of the workers who can do their jobs from home combining in-person and remote work, according to Gallup.
A spokeswoman for the Labor Department said the survey most likely did not reflect informal work-from-home arrangements.
"Taking into account that the self-employed and the public sector are not included in the sample, and that this is a survey of establishments rather than individuals, our estimates do not appear out of line with other estimates," the spokeswoman said.
Stanford's monthly study on working from home, which surveys 10,000 workers across cities and industries, found that 27 percent of paid full-time days were worked from home in early 2023.
Much of that remote work came from hybrid setups. Last month, the survey found that 12 percent of workers were fully remote, roughly 60 percent fully in person and 28 percent hybrid.
Other sources of data confirm that working-from-home patterns remain entrenched in certain industries. The building security firm Kastle, for example, tracks data on office badge swipes and reported this month that offices remained at roughly 48 percent of their prepandemic occupancy.
A closer look at New York, from the Partnership for New York City, found that 52 percent of Manhattan office workers were working in person on an average day at the start of this year, up from 49 percent in September. But only 9 percent of employees were in the office five days a week, underscoring the reach of hybrid arrangements. And Square, the retail technology company, which tracks payments at food and drink establishments, found that sales growth at bars and restaurants in Brooklyn had recently outpaced growth of those in Manhattan.
"It's clear that the work-from-home trends induced by the pandemic have transformed the food and drink scene in the city," said Ara Kharazian, an economist at Square.
The Partnership for New York City's data indicated that financial service firms were back in the office in greater numbers than many other companies. Financial service firms reported 59 percent daily office attendance in late January, according to the partnership. The tech industry, by contrast, was at 43 percent.
All this data is emerging as hundreds of companies formalize their policies on hybrid work, with many trying to persuade their employees to spend more time at the office.
Amazon told corporate workers last month that they had to be in the office three days a week starting in May, and Starbucks called its 3,750 corporate workers back three days a week as well. Disney asked employees to return to the office four days a week. Its chief executive, Robert A. Iger, cited the need for in-person creative collaborations.
Other chief executives have also begun to question the merits of remote work. Even Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which told all its employees that they could go permanently remote, began voicing concern this year that productivity among some employees has been lower.
As executives clamp down on in-person work, worker resistance has become more vocal. At Amazon, more than 29,000 employees joined a Slack channel, called Remote Advocacy, protesting the shift to in-person work. At Starbucks, more than 40 corporate employees signed an open letter opposing the new return-to-office policy.
Wherever people are doing the jobs they already have, mostly in person per the Labor Department or over a quarter of the time at home per others, one metric does indicate that hybrid work is here to stay: job postings.
A study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and other institutions analyzing over 50 million job postings last month found that postings explicitly mentioning remote work are at 12.2 percent -- a fourfold increase since before the pandemic.

Golf at 3 p.m. Tuesday? It's the Afternoon Fun Economy.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Remote workers have fueled a surge in weekday exercise, cosmetics and leisure -- especially at the driving range.
At the Chelsea Piers outdoor golf club, on a recent unseasonably warm Monday afternoon, 55 people were playing golf by 3:45, and a handful were sipping beers. At CutLoose hair salon, in Brooklyn, N.Y., the stylists now watch their clients take Zoom meetings from the salon chairs. And at Skyway Golf Course, in Jersey City, N.J., Steve Mills, a general manager, has noticed that weekday afternoons are jammed with a new group of golfers.
"We call them the remote guys," Mr. Mills, 48, said. "These were guys we used to see running to the golf course after work. Now they're able to come out leisurely and get their golf done, instead of changing in the parking lot."
The leisure industry is facing a surge in demand for afternoon services, especially in fitness and cosmetics. It's the rise of the "afternoon fun" economy.
Millions of Americans who started working from home three years ago because of the Covid-19 pandemic are now set in those remote routines because they like the flexibility. At the start of 2023, more than a quarter of paid full-time work days were done from home, according to data from Stanford on U.S. workers. Roughly half of workers who can do their jobs remotely are now in hybrid arrangements. That means people who used to have to use their lunch hour, or wait until after work, to squeeze in a workout or beauty treatments can now extend their leisure time into the afternoon, and tack on extra hours of work after dark.
A new study from Stanford shines a light on the rise of afternoon leisure. Using geolocation data near golf courses in the United States, the study found there was 278 percent more people playing golf at 4 p.m. on a Wednesday in August 2022 than in August 2019. And there were 83 percent more golf games being played on a weekday in August 2022 than in August 2019, according to the researchers, Nick Bloom and Alex Finan, who studied data, from the company Inrix, at more than 3,400 golf courses.
"We're turned into a student economy," Mr. Bloom said. "You're in the library in the evenings, and in the afternoon you're sleeping off your hangover."
The rise of afternoon leisure could be playing an under-examined role in driving America's economic rebound since 2020, Mr. Bloom said. Historically, productivity in the manufacturing sector has grown at a faster rate than productivity in the services sector. Service sector productivity tends to grow slowly even as its wages rise quickly to keep pace with other industries. That's because the amount of time people can devote to services -- shopping, entertainment, beauty treatments -- has long been constrained by the rigidity of a nine-to-five grind.
Remote work partly did away with that constraint. More flexible work arrangements mean workers can decide to push back their professional responsibilities into the evening and take care of personal ones during the day -- often with the blessing of their bosses.
"This is an amazing potential reversal," Mr. Bloom added. "You can have a huge increase in productivity using leisure resources throughout the week. It's an odd unexpected boost from post-pandemic working from home."
The effects of this shift are being felt across the leisure economy. ClassPass, a platform that partners with thousands of fitness and beauty studios, found that the most popular time for people to schedule a salon or spa treatment last year was noon; in 2019, it was 6 p.m. The Chelsea Piers golf club, which had its busiest year ever in 2022, increased the fee for its off-peak membership (for people playing golf at traditionally less popular weekday hours) to $ 1,825 last year from $ 1,520 because of rising demand. Bouldering Project, which has 10 rock-climbing gyms in seven U.S. cities, said some of its buildings were full throughout the week with remote workers doing workouts in between their video calls. Y7, a yoga chain, has tracked a surge in sign ups for its 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekday classes.
"We used to get a lot more people leaving early from class in the morning -- they wouldn't stay for Shavasana," Sarah Larson Levey, chief executive of Y7, said, referring to the final resting portion of a yoga class. "Literally right after the slow burn portion, before any restorative poses, half the room would leave."
With more people now working remote, that exodus no longer occurs. "I took a 10:30 on Wednesday last week, and every single person stayed," Ms. Larson Levey said. "I think 4 p.m. is going to be the new 7 p.m. when it comes to workouts."
Joel Moore, owner of a golf club called The Ridge in New Jersey, found himself busier than ever in 2021. At one point, he and his wife looked at each other and realized what was driving their foot traffic: remote workers.
"We didn't have a crystal ball to look into as we were budgeting for 2021 and 2022, and we were elated," he said. "We're seeing people during the week that we never saw before."
There used to be a sizable portion of members whom Mr. Moore saw only on weekends, or occasionally on summer evenings when they came from the office and rushed into the locker room to change from dress shirts and blazers into polo shirts. Now many of his members, who include lawyers and pharmaceutical executives, wake up early in the morning to race through meetings so they can get to the golf course by lunch time.
"They're not sneaking away," he added. "They're getting the work done, just not at your typical hours."
Some golf course managers also noted that remote work had coincided with a push in the golfing world for shorter games. "Maybe people have a little bit more time, the interest is there and we're able to morph the game a little bit to meet people's schedules," said Marshall Ormand, who manages a municipal golf course in Charleston, S.C.
Of course, many remote workers have reconfigured the shape of their workdays for the opposite of leisure: child care. People are working 28 percent more after the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours, according to a report from Microsoft. For many working mothers, remote work didn't initially bring any time for leisure. Mothers were more likely than fathers to be interrupted by family responsibilities while working from home, according to at least one study, a particular source of stress when schools were shut down because of Covid.
But now that schools are open, some workers are welcoming the opportunity to tackle errands during the weekday. Some of this extension of economic leisure is above board, as managers accept that people are rethinking their schedules.
Stephanie Cunningham, 27, who works in marketing, was sitting in CutLoose, the Brooklyn hair salon, waiting for an appointment on a Thursday afternoon. She said her boss has been supportive when she had to sign on earlier in the morning or later in the evening to get work done so that she could take a break to run errands, including grocery shopping and walking her dog.
"My boss allows me to take time for myself," Ms. Cunningham said. "As long as I get my work done."
Celiann Figueroa, 25, a stylist at CutLoose, said her weekdays were far busier than they were before the pandemic. She used to spend afternoons, at a different Brooklyn salon, waiting for her harried customers to leave the office. Now her noon to 4 p.m. slot is consistently full. Her daily appointment numbers have more than doubled.
Partly that's because her clients are treating the salon like an office. "I've had a client sit outside with foils in her hair hosting a Zoom meeting," she said, adding that she often has to adjust the position of people's heads so they can look at their laptops while she styles their hair. "It's funny seeing people sit up and try to be professional."
And for some people straddling office and leisure, there's a delight in the fusion. Tyler Kevorkian, the assistant general manager of Bouldering Project in Washington, D.C., said he had seen one person help run a gelato company from his gym. He has also seen government employees and lawyers writing memos steps away from the rock climbing walls.
"People just make this their office," he said. "Sometimes when you're working, you get antsy and anxious. You can go downstairs, do some pull-ups, sweat it out and then jump right back into a meeting."
But plenty of business leaders are wary about this leisure-time expansion. In recent months, concerns about employee engagement have crept into executive commentary on remote work.
Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which allowed many of its employees to work fully remote, voiced anxiety earlier this year about the effects of that decision: "We don't have the same level of performance and productivity that we had in 2020 before the pandemic," Mr. Benioff said.
At Amazon, Andy Jassy has been similarly emphatic about the benefits of in-person work: "When you're in-person, people tend to be more engaged," he wrote in a memo to employees last month. And at Jefferies, its chief executive, Rich Handler, and its president, Brian Friedman, sent a memo in the fall underscoring that they expected to see people in person: "It is abundantly clear that we need to be together as much as possible."
But these executives are facing a work force newly emboldened by the balance they've achieved between their work and personal life, whether that means family obligations or playing golf. Take Wade McDaniel, a vice president at Gartner, who is one of the golfers embracing the benefits of the afternoon fun economy. Mr. McDaniel, 62, said he was a different version of himself before remote work.
"I would have been defined as a classic workaholic -- that showed up in poor health, poor relationship management," he said.
Now, Mr. McDaniel starts work at 5 a.m. and gets to his local golf course in Phoenix by 3 p.m. "Unless there's something that is semi critical going on, I don't take my work phone with me," he said. "The only reason I use my phone is for the golf app."

Full text: What's Up? (March 12-18)
Financial Panic
After the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in last weekend to take over Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, panic rippled through the banking sector, touching off government interventions to prop up other suffering banking institutions. On Thursday, 11 of the country's biggest banks combined resources to inject $ 30 billion into First Republic Bank, the 14th-largest U.S. bank, which found itself on the brink of collapse. The infusion was the result of an agreement reached by Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, whose bank saved several rivals during the 2008 financial crisis. But though some hear echoes of 2008 in this banking crisis, the White House would like to avoid comparisons. Despite sweeping actions by the Federal Reserve, Treasury and F.D.I.C. to protect clients' deposits and assets and shore up confidence in the country's banks, President Biden is loath to use the term "bailout."
More Tech Layoffs
Meta announced last week that it would lay off another 10,000 employees, or 13 percent of its work force, as it pares down after a hiring boom that accelerated during the pandemic. The mass layoff is the second to roil Meta in recent months: In November, the company let go 11,000 workers across departments and regions. In the time since, Meta reported that it was taking a $ 4.2 billion restructuring charge for the fourth quarter and expecting an additional $ 1 billion in restructuring costs in 2023 to account for its plans to terminate some office space leases, redesign some data center projects and pay out severance for laid-off employees. Similar efforts to cut costs have been underway at Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Salesforce, as boom times in the tech industry come to an end.
Inflation Remains Stubborn
Data released on Tuesday showed that annual inflation had cooled slightly, with the Consumer Price Index climbing 6 percent over the year through February -- down from 6.4 percent in January. But more troubling signs lay beneath the surface of the report: Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, climbed 0.5 percent from the previous month, exceeding analysts' expectations and making for the fastest monthly pickup since September. Officials at the Federal Reserve had been awaiting this data to inform their decision about interest-rate increases at their next meeting this week.
What's Next? (March 19-25)
A Juggernaut in the Spotlight
Shou Zi Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, will testify again before Congress on Thursday as the app comes under increasing scrutiny from President Biden and other policymakers in Washington. Last week, TikTok said the Biden administration wanted its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app, threatening a ban in the United States if it could not complete a deal. The crux of Washington lawmakers' concerns is fear that Beijing could request the data of the 100 million Americans who use the app. But a sale could be difficult to pull off: TikTok's price tag of $ 50 billion or more would be too steep for all except a tech giant like Meta or Google -- but those companies would probably want to avoid the antitrust battle that could arise from trying to acquire the social media juggernaut.
What Will the Fed Do?
As the Federal Reserve prepares to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, central bankers face a more complicated calculus than they may have expected a few weeks ago. There are new economic data, including job and inflation reports, to factor into their decision on how much to raise interest rates -- or whether to raise them at all. But officials are also looking at the collapse of three banks that were caught flat-footed by the previous jump in rates, which significantly dinged the market value of their holdings. So while a relatively hot job market and persistent inflation provide Fed officials with reason to continue on a path of aggressive rate increases, the turmoil in the banking sector has made analysts uncertain about the Fed's next move.
Dominion v. Fox, Continued
On Tuesday, lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News will present their oral arguments for summary judgment in Dominion's suit accusing Fox of defaming it by casting the company as a villain as the network amplified false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Dominion requested the summary judgment, which is a process for deciding a case without going to trial. The company has argued that Fox has not provided any new evidence to support its election conspiracies and that the news network has already conceded that it knew the on-air statements were bogus. Its court filing includes many of the recently released private messages that Fox News anchors and other staff exchanged, expressing skepticism about the narrative the network was promoting on its broadcasts.
What Else?
Emmett Shear, the chief executive of the livestreaming site Twitch, said on Thursday that he was resigning after 16 years. A federal regulator last week approved a $ 31 billion rail company merger, paving the way for the creation a railroad that links Canada, the United States and Mexico. And CNN's prime-time audience has fallen since the network overhauled its 9 p.m. programming.

At the Chelsea Piers outdoor golf club, on a recent unseasonably warm Monday afternoon, 55 people were playing golf by 3:45, and a handful were sipping beers. At CutLoose hair salon, in Brooklyn, New York, the stylists now watch their clients take Zoom meetings from the salon chairs. And at Skyway Golf Course, in Jersey City, New Jersey, Steve Mills, a general manager, has noticed that weekday afternoons are jammed with a new group of golfers.
“We call them the remote guys,” Mills, 48, said. “These were guys we used to see running to the golf course after work. Now they’re able to come out leisurely and get their golf done, instead of changing in the parking lot.”
The leisure industry is facing a surge in demand for afternoon services, especially in fitness and cosmetics. It’s the rise of the “afternoon fun” economy.
Millions of Americans who started working from home three years ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic are now set in those remote routines because they like the flexibility. At the start of 2023, more than a quarter of paid full-time work days were done from home, according to data from Stanford on U.S. workers. Roughly half of workers who can do their jobs remotely are now in hybrid arrangements. That means people who used to have to use their lunch hour, or wait until after work, to squeeze in a workout or beauty treatments can now extend their leisure time into the afternoon, and tack on extra hours of work after dark.
A new study from Stanford shines a light on the rise of afternoon leisure. Using geolocation data near golf courses in the United States, the study found there was 278% more people playing golf at 4 p.m. on a Wednesday in August 2022 than in August 2019. And there were 83% more golf games being played on a weekday in August 2022 than in August 2019, according to the researchers, Nick Bloom and Alex Finan, who studied data, from the company Inrix, at more than 3,400 golf courses.
“We’re turned into a student economy,” Bloom said. “You’re in the library in the evenings, and in the afternoon you’re sleeping off your hangover.”
The rise of afternoon leisure could be playing an under-examined role in driving America’s economic rebound since 2020, Bloom said. Historically, productivity in the manufacturing sector has grown at a faster rate than productivity in the services sector. Service sector productivity tends to grow slowly even as its wages rise quickly to keep pace with other industries. That’s because the amount of time people can devote to services — shopping, entertainment, beauty treatments — has long been constrained by the rigidity of a 9-to-5 grind.
Remote work partly did away with that constraint. More flexible work arrangements mean workers can decide to push back their professional responsibilities into the evening and take care of personal ones during the day — often with the blessing of their bosses.
“This is an amazing potential reversal,” Bloom added. “You can have a huge increase in productivity using leisure resources throughout the week. It’s an odd unexpected boost from post-pandemic working from home.”
The effects of this shift are being felt across the leisure economy. ClassPass, a platform that partners with thousands of fitness and beauty studios, found that the most popular time for people to schedule a salon or spa treatment last year was noon; in 2019, it was 6 p.m. The Chelsea Piers golf club, which had its busiest year ever in 2022, increased the fee for its off-peak membership (for people playing golf at traditionally less popular weekday hours) to $1,825 last year from $1,520 because of rising demand. Bouldering Project, which has 10 rock-climbing gyms in seven U.S. cities, said some of its buildings were full throughout the week with remote workers doing workouts in between their video calls. Y7, a yoga chain, has tracked a surge in sign ups for its 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekday classes.
“We used to get a lot more people leaving early from class in the morning — they wouldn’t stay for Shavasana,” Sarah Larson Levey, chief executive of Y7, said, referring to the final resting portion of a yoga class. “Literally right after the slow burn portion, before any restorative poses, half the room would leave.”
With more people now working remote, that exodus no longer occurs. “I took a 10:30 on Wednesday last week, and every single person stayed,” Larson Levey said. “I think 4 p.m. is going to be the new 7 p.m. when it comes to workouts.”
Joel Moore, owner of a golf club called the Ridge in New Jersey, found himself busier than ever in 2021. At one point, he and his wife looked at each other and realized what was driving their foot traffic: remote workers.
“We didn’t have a crystal ball to look into as we were budgeting for 2021 and 2022, and we were elated,” he said. “We’re seeing people during the week that we never saw before.”
There used to be a sizable portion of members whom Moore saw only on weekends, or occasionally on summer evenings when they came from the office and rushed into the locker room to change from dress shirts and blazers into polo shirts. Now many of his members, who include lawyers and pharmaceutical executives, wake up early in the morning to race through meetings so they can get to the golf course by lunch time.
“They’re not sneaking away,” he added. “They’re getting the work done, just not at your typical hours.”
Some golf course managers also noted that remote work had coincided with a push in the golfing world for shorter games. “Maybe people have a little bit more time, the interest is there and we’re able to morph the game a little bit to meet people’s schedules,” said Marshall Ormand, who manages a municipal golf course in Charleston, South Carolina.
Of course, many remote workers have reconfigured the shape of their workdays for the opposite of leisure: child care. People are working 28% more after the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours, according to a report from Microsoft. For many working mothers, remote work didn’t initially bring any time for leisure. Mothers were more likely than fathers to be interrupted by family responsibilities while working from home, according to at least one study, a particular source of stress when schools were shut down because of COVID.
But now that schools are open, some workers are welcoming the opportunity to tackle errands during the weekday. Some of this extension of economic leisure is above board, as managers accept that people are rethinking their schedules.
Stephanie Cunningham, 27, who works in marketing, was sitting in CutLoose, the Brooklyn hair salon, waiting for an appointment on a Thursday afternoon. She said her boss has been supportive when she had to sign on earlier in the morning or later in the evening to get work done so that she could take a break to run errands, including grocery shopping and walking her dog.
“My boss allows me to take time for myself,” Cunningham said. “As long as I get my work done.”
Celiann Figueroa, 25, a stylist at CutLoose, said her weekdays were far busier than they were before the pandemic. She used to spend afternoons, at a different Brooklyn salon, waiting for her harried customers to leave the office. Now her noon to 4 p.m. slot is consistently full. Her daily appointment numbers have more than doubled.
Partly that’s because her clients are treating the salon like an office. “I’ve had a client sit outside with foils in her hair hosting a Zoom meeting,” she said, adding that she often has to adjust the position of people’s heads so they can look at their laptops while she styles their hair. “It’s funny seeing people sit up and try to be professional.”
And for some people straddling office and leisure, there’s a delight in the fusion. Tyler Kevorkian, the assistant general manager of Bouldering Project in Washington, D.C., said he had seen one person help run a gelato company from his gym. He has also seen government employees and lawyers writing memos steps away from the rock climbing walls.
“People just make this their office,” he said. “Sometimes when you’re working, you get antsy and anxious. You can go downstairs, do some pullups, sweat it out and then jump right back into a meeting.”
But plenty of business leaders are wary about this leisure-time expansion. In recent months, concerns about employee engagement have crept into executive commentary on remote work.
Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which allowed many of its employees to work fully remote, voiced anxiety earlier this year about the effects of that decision: “We don’t have the same level of performance and productivity that we had in 2020 before the pandemic,” Benioff said.
At Amazon, Andy Jassy has been similarly emphatic about the benefits of in-person work: “When you’re in-person, people tend to be more engaged,” he wrote in a memo to employees last month. And at Jefferies, its chief executive, Rich Handler, and its president, Brian Friedman, sent a memo in the fall underscoring that they expected to see people in person: “It is abundantly clear that we need to be together as much as possible.”
But these executives are facing a workforce newly emboldened by the balance they’ve achieved between their work and personal life, whether that means family obligations or playing golf. Take Wade McDaniel, a vice president at Gartner, who is one of the golfers embracing the benefits of the afternoon fun economy. McDaniel, 62, said he was a different version of himself before remote work.
“I would have been defined as a classic workaholic — that showed up in poor health, poor relationship management,” he said.
Now, McDaniel starts work at 5 a.m. and gets to his local golf course in Phoenix by 3 p.m. “Unless there’s something that is semi critical going on, I don’t take my work phone with me,” he said. “The only reason I use my phone is for the golf app.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Funding Frenzy Is Enveloping A.I. Start-Ups: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In just weeks, a gold rush into artificial intelligence start-ups has become a full-blown mania.
When four leading artificial intelligence researchers left Google this year to create a start-up called Mobius AI, they weren't sure what their product might be -- just that it would involve A.I. technology that could generate its own photos and videos.
Within about a week, two of Silicon Valley's top venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz and Index Ventures, had swooped in with a funding offer, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
Suddenly, Mobius -- little more than more than four guys and a laptop -- was valued around $ 100 million, an usually high number for a start-up that was just a week or so old, the people said. When word of the deal leaked out, other investors descended to urge Mobius to take their money, too, they said.
Over the past few months, a gold rush into start-ups working on "generative" artificial intelligence has escalated into a no-holds-barred deal-making mania. The interest has mounted so rapidly that A.I. start-up valuations are soaring beyond that of 2021's "everything bubble," with investors trawling the rosters of companies like Google, Meta and OpenAI for A.I. experts who may have an itch to start their own company.
The funding race has heated up ever since ChatGPT, the chatbot made by OpenAI, went viral last year by showing the power of A.I. to generate its own tweets, emails, articles, answers and ideas. Even as investors expect last week's failure of Silicon Valley Bank, an institution that many tech start-ups relied on, to cast a pall over start-up funding, there is still a mismatch between the number of opportunities in artificial intelligence and the money available to fund them.
That's because of the scarcity of A.I. companies and the potential of the technology. With few experts in the field, and most of them working at a handful of big tech companies, only a few generative A.I. start-ups -- such as Stability AI and Jasper -- have broken out. Investors desperate for the next big thing are competing fiercely to invest in these companies, offering some A.I. entrepreneurs nine-figure valuations for little more than an idea and a résumé.
"We're in that phase of the market where it's, like, let 1,000 flowers bloom," said Matt Turck, an investor who specializes in A.I. at the venture firm FirstMark. He added that the deal-making stood out in an otherwise dreary moment for tech marked by layoffs, cost-cutting and a drought of initial public offerings.
Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to a request to comment. Index Ventures declined to comment on Mobius's funding.
The blooming flowers include Dust, a start-up founded by former employees of OpenAI. Dust is nearing a $ 5 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital that will value it at $ 30 million to $ 40 million, two people with knowledge of the situation said. The round was competitive, with term sheets offering valuations as high as twice that, one of the people said.
Perplexity AI, a start-up created by former employees of OpenAI, Google and Meta, is raising $ 20 million to $ 25 million, led by NEA, that values the company at about $ 150 million, two people familiar with the situation said. And LangChain, a start-up working on software that helps other companies incorporate A.I. into their products, has raised funding from Benchmark, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Those follow the $ 13 billion that OpenAI raised from Microsoft, including $ 10 billion in January, and $ 300 million raised this year by Anthropic, another A.I. start-up.
Dust and LangChain declined to comment.Various aspects of the funding rounds were reported earlier by Business Insider, The Information and Newcomer.
At Y Combinator, the start-up incubator, at least 50 of the 218 companies in the current program are working on generative A.I., according to a tally taken by Truewind, an A.I. bookkeeping start-up that is part of the program. Alex Lee, Truewind's chief executive, said ChatGPT had helped investors, potential customers and potential employees understand the possibilities of the technology.
"Before, you'd go in and say, 'We're doing something with A.I.,' and it's hard to picture exactly what that looks like," Mr. Lee said. "Now, they say, 'Oh, I've played with ChaptGPT, and I can imagine how I could use this in my world."'
He declined to comment on his company's fund-raising ahead of Y Combinator's demo day, when companies pitch investors, in April.
Even though more mature A.I. start-ups have already raised large sums, they can't afford to ignore the latest overtures from investors, said Mike Volpi, an investor at Index Ventures who sits on the board of the A.I. start-up Cohere.
That's partly because A.I. technologies like ChatGPT, which learn by analyzing vast amounts of digital data, require a lot of computing power, which is expensive. Mr. Volpi estimated that start-ups needed at least $ 500 million to develop their own large language model, the technology that underpins ChatGPT.
At a tech conference in Los Angeles organized by the investment firm Upfront Ventures this month, A.I. was inescapable. The event began with a goofy video skit about a venture capitalist giving a ChatGPT-generated speech. It quickly went off the rails, with the investor confidently regurgitating incorrect information from the bot as the punchline.
Speakers -- including Al Gore; Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce; and V Pappas, a top executive at TikTok -- weighed in from there, mostly by hailing the technology's transformative potential. A panel of A.I. specialists said they welcomed the sudden attention, with Phil Blunsom, head of science at Cohere, noting that he has worked on language modeling for 20 years and that, until recently, "absolutely no one was interested in it."
Some investors debated whether A.I. start-ups would get run over by more established players with deeper pockets. Given the steep computing costs, some said big players like Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, had too much of an advantage. Google bought the A.I. lab DeepMind, which is developing a wide range of technologies as an Alphabet subsidiary, in 2014 for $ 650 million.
Last week, Salesforce announced a $ 250 million fund for investing in generative A.I. start-ups, alongside new investments in Cohere, Anthropic and others.
"There are a few times in technology where you really see a generational leap forward with revolutionary technology," said John Somorjai, who leads Salesforce's venture investments. "These companies are the next trillion-dollar opportunities in software."
Sam Lessin, a venture capitalist at Slow Ventures, said he didn't think the tech advances in A.I. translated to opportunities for start-ups. The best way to invest in A.I., Mr. Lessin said, is to buy the publicly traded stocks of big tech companies.
"The absolute vast majority of the spoils will go to the incumbents," he said.

In Meta Plan For Layoffs, 10,000 Jobs Are Targeted: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It would be the tech company's second round of cuts since November. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has declared 2023 the "year of efficiency."
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, the latest move to hew to what the company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a "year of efficiency."
The layoffs will affect Meta's recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company's website. The announcement is the company's second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Mr. Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta's hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing last March.
"This will be tough and there's no way around that," he wrote.
Meta's stock rose more than 7 percent by the close of trading on Tuesday.
Mr. Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured, and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Mr. Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Mr. Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the chief executive said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or "managers managing managers." He said he took responsibility for last year's layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta's layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions.
But even beyond the macroeconomic conditions, Meta is dealing with many challenges. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple's privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta's ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years. And regulators have stepped up efforts to rein in the company by pushing for new laws that would limit Meta's data collection abilities.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a "metaverse" company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Mr. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it's unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in A.I. for years but lately has not been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
Employees have been bracing for more layoffs for months, watching with anxiety as Mr. Zuckerberg embarked on a quest to dial back what he felt was no longer necessary to run the company, according to current and former employees. But the expectation was that he would take a light touch to his favored project of the metaverse.
Some Meta employees who were affected by Tuesday's announcement of layoffs -- especially in the recruiting division -- felt "gut-punched," according to current and former employees who have spoken with those in the organization.
"People are entering a job market that is the worst I've ever seen," said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. She said the staggered nature of Meta's cuts over the next two months was adding to employee anxiety.
"There's a lot of uncertainty," Ms. Sumner said. "There's a lot of anger, and there's the question many folks are asking: 'How do you expect me to do work for the next two months while wondering if I will still have a job?"'
In his announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out a vision for streamlining the company by removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering.
To that end, Mr. Zuckerberg wound down efforts on building NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, a cryptocurrency-based initiative that has dropped out of favor in recent months. Many of Mr. Zuckerberg's crypto initiatives in general have fallen by the wayside over the past nine months as the public has grown more skeptical of the market after the implosion of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange.
In his note, Mr. Zuckerberg added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.
"The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew and our growth slowed considerably," he said. "We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years."

“We’re in that phase of the market where it’s, like, let 1,000 flowers bloom,” said Matt Turck, an investor who specializes in AI at venture firm FirstMark. He added that the deal-making stood out in an otherwise dreary moment for tech marked by layoffs, cost-cutting and a drought of initial public offerings.
Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to a request to comment. Index Ventures declined to comment on Mobius’ funding.
The blooming flowers include Dust, a startup founded by former employees of OpenAI. Dust is nearing a $5 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital that will value it at $30 million to $40 million, two people with knowledge of the situation said. The round was competitive, with term sheets offering valuations as high as twice that, one of the people said.
Perplexity AI, a startup created by former employees of OpenAI, Google and Meta, is raising $20 million to $25 million, led by NEA, that values the company at about $150 million, two people familiar with the situation said. And LangChain, a startup working on software that helps other companies incorporate AI into their products, has raised funding from Benchmark, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Those follow the $13 billion that OpenAI raised from Microsoft, including $10 billion in January, and $300 million raised this year by Anthropic, another AI startup.
Dust and LangChain declined to comment. Various aspects of the funding rounds were earlier reported by Business Insider, The Information and Newcomer.
At Y Combinator, a startup incubator, at least 50 of the 218 companies in the current program are working on generative AI, according to a tally taken by Truewind, an AI bookkeeping startup that is part of the program. Alex Lee, Truewind’s CEO, said ChatGPT had helped investors, potential customers and potential employees understand the possibilities of the technology.
“Before, you’d go in and say, ‘We’re doing something with AI,’ and it’s hard to picture exactly what that looks like,” Lee said. “Now, they say, ‘Oh, I’ve played with ChaptGPT, and I can imagine how I could use this in my world.’”
He declined to comment on his company’s fundraising before Y Combinator’s demo day, when companies pitch investors, in April.
Even though more mature AI startups have already raised large sums, they can’t afford to ignore the latest overtures from investors, said Mike Volpi, an investor at Index Ventures who sits on the board of the AI startup Cohere.
That’s partly because AI technologies like ChatGPT, which learn by analyzing vast amounts of digital data, require a lot of computing power, which is expensive. Volpi estimated that startups needed at least $500 million to develop their own large language model, the technology that underpins ChatGPT.
At a tech conference in Los Angeles organized by investment firm Upfront Ventures this month, AI was inescapable. The event began with a goofy video skit about a venture capitalist giving a ChatGPT-generated speech. It quickly went off the rails, with the investor confidently regurgitating incorrect information from the bot as the punchline.
Speakers — including former Vice President Al Gore; Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce; and V Pappas, a top executive at TikTok — weighed in from there, mostly by hailing the technology’s transformative potential. A panel of AI specialists said they welcomed the sudden attention, with Phil Blunsom, head of science at Cohere, noting that he has worked on language modeling for 20 years and that, until recently, “absolutely no one was interested in it.”
Some investors debated whether AI startups would get run over by more established players with deeper pockets. Given the steep computing costs, some said big players like Microsoft and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, had too much of an advantage. Google bought the AI lab DeepMind, which is developing a wide range of technologies as an Alphabet subsidiary, in 2014 for $650 million.
Last week, Salesforce announced a $250 million fund for investing in generative AI startups, alongside new investments in Cohere, Anthropic and others.
“There are a few times in technology where you really see a generational leap forward with revolutionary technology,” said John Somorjai, who leads Salesforce’s venture investments. “These companies are the next trillion-dollar opportunities in software.”
Sam Lessin, a venture capitalist at Slow Ventures, said he didn’t think the tech advances in AI translated to opportunities for startups. The best way to invest in AI, Lessin said, is to buy the publicly traded stocks of Big Tech companies.
“The absolute vast majority of the spoils will go to the incumbents,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Meta to Lay Off 10,000 More Workers

SAN FRANCISCO — Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13% of its workforce, the latest move to hew to what the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a “year of efficiency.”
The layoffs will affect Meta’s recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company’s website. The announcement is the company’s second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13% of its workforce at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta’s hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing in March 2022.
“This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” he wrote.
Meta’s stock rose more than 7% by the close of trading Tuesday.
Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the CEO said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or “managers managing managers.” He said he took responsibility for last year’s layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta’s layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions.
But even beyond the macroeconomic conditions, Meta is dealing with many challenges. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple’s privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta’s ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years. And regulators have stepped up efforts to rein in the company by pushing for new laws that would limit Meta’s data collection abilities.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a “metaverse” company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it’s unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in AI for years but has not lately been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
Employees have been bracing for more layoffs for months, watching with anxiety as Zuckerberg embarked on a quest to dial back what he felt was no longer necessary to run the company, according to current and former employees. But the expectation was that he would take a light touch to his favored project of the metaverse.
Some Meta employees who were affected by Tuesday’s announcement of layoffs — especially in the recruiting division — felt “gut-punched,” according to current and former employees who have spoken with those in the organization.
“People are entering a job market that is the worst I’ve ever seen,” said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. She said the staggered nature of Meta’s cuts over the next two months was adding to employee anxiety.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Sumner said. “There’s a lot of anger, and there’s the question many folks are asking: ‘How do you expect me to do work for the next two months while wondering if I will still have a job?’”
In his announcement Tuesday, Zuckerberg laid out a vision for streamlining the company by removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering.
To that end, Zuckerberg wound down efforts on building NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, a cryptocurrency-based initiative that has dropped out of favor in recent months. Many of Zuckerberg’s crypto initiatives in general have fallen by the wayside over the past nine months as the public has grown more skeptical of the market after the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
In his note, Zuckerberg added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.
“The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew, and our growth slowed considerably,” he said. “We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.”

WeWork, Reeling From Cash Crunch, Tries to Shore Up Financial Footing

WeWork, the troubled office space company built by entrepreneur Adam Neumann that has struggled to right itself in recent years, is in talks with investors to restructure its outstanding debt of more than $3 billion and raise more cash.
An infusion of cash would most likely give WeWork the hundreds of millions of dollars it needed to keep operating for at least a few years, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations. And restructuring its debt would give executives some leeway to continue reshaping the company without having to worry about running out of funds.
Yardi, a real estate software provider in Santa Barbara, California, is among the investors considering new investment in the company, the people said. Yardi has already been working closely with WeWork as it expands beyond offering coworking spaces to additional services like software for office management at its properties.
There is no guarantee that the WeWork deal will close, and even if it does, it could be weeks away, one of the people said.
The moves to overhaul WeWork’s debt come after the company burned through more than $700 million of cash last year. Still, the company’s performance has gradually improved.
And the company’s talks with investors underscore the continuing challenges to its business, which involves leasing office space from landlords and then charging customers to use it.
SoftBank, the Japanese investment conglomerate that is both WeWork’s largest shareholder and its largest creditor, is playing a key role in the negotiations. It is not expected, however, to put any additional money into the company, the people said. Since 2017, SoftBank has poured more than $10 billion into WeWork and written off billions of dollars in losses on its investment.
SoftBank recently took more steps to shore up WeWork’s financial footing. It lent WeWork $250 million in January, and last month agreed to increase the size of a debt facility and extended the date at which it had to be paid back to March 2025 from November this year.
In addition to SoftBank’s efforts, the deal under discussion will give WeWork the breathing room to focus on improving its performance and growing the company, which involves finding areas to cut costs. In January, WeWork said it would cut 300 employee positions.
Sandeep Mathrani, a veteran of the real estate industry who took over as CEO in February 2020, has been working to improve the company’s financials — a task made easier as office occupancy, which was hit hard during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, ticked higher in the last quarter of 2022.
Last month, in a call with Wall Street analysts, Mathrani raised the possibility of a debt restructuring, saying that the company expected to work toward extending the dates by which its debt must be paid back. But the urgency to lighten its debt load may have increased as WeWork grapples with headwinds in its business.
Founded in 2010 in New York, WeWork, once a darling of the startup world, has since become a cautionary tale. Neumann positioned WeWork as a technology-enabled company that transcended the traditional real estate business. It was a pitch that charmed well-known investors, such as Benchmark Capital, Fidelity and SoftBank, and convinced them to invest at valuations more akin to high-growth technology companies than real estate ones.
At its peak, WeWork was valued at $47 billion in early 2019, before it sought to go public. But Neumann’s ambitions came hurtling to the ground as WeWork’s losses mounted. The company failed to convince investors to buy into its planned initial public offering, forcing it to cancel those plans.
In September 2019, Neumann gave up the CEO role. SoftBank spent billions of dollars to rescue the company — which was in danger of running out of cash before the end of that year — and buy out shareholders, including Neumann. The deal to save WeWork came with massive layoffs.
Things only worsened in 2020 when the pandemic shuttered offices and forced employees to work from home and away from WeWork’s Instagram-ready rental spaces. The company’s customers abandoned their memberships in droves.
At the time, WeWork said going public would provide new capital to grow the company while it cut costs by renegotiating its leases. It finally went public in October 2021, one of the many companies that did so by merging with a special purpose acquisition company.
But the company’s value has continued to decline as it burns through cash. At the end of last year, WeWork had $287 million of cash, down from $924 million at the end of 2021. In the fourth quarter, WeWork said it lost $568 million as it juggled pricey leases while selling customers on new products, such as office management software. It ended 2022 with $15.6 billion of lease obligations and more than $3 billion of borrowings weighing down its balance sheet.
The company’s stock price shows just how nervous investors have been about its fate and its debt coming due over the next few years, most of which is owed to SoftBank. WeWork’s shares have hovered around $1, down roughly 90% from its stock price when the company went public.
In the meantime, Neumann walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars. He is now running a new real estate startup called Flow with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, the prominent venture firm.
Neumann remains a shareholder of WeWork, but he is far removed from the company. As part of a 2021 deal with SoftBank, when they bought more of his shares, he was not allowed to participate in board meetings, one of the people with knowledge of the situation said. The next year, he was allowed to ask SoftBank whether he or a designee could return to the board as an observer. He hasn’t asked to return. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Buffett Makes His Case In Trillion-Dollar Debate Over Stock Buybacks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The White House is at odds with business leaders over share repurchase programs. DealBook digs into the numbers to see who's gaining from the practice.
Buyback now, profit later?
Share buybacks provided plenty of big headlines this week.
The Biden administration seems ready to pick a fight with any firm looking to set aside billions for such megapurchases. The White House and some Democrats would rather C.E.O.s use the money to reinvest in their businesses -- that would lead to stronger firms, more jobs and better returns for investors, the thinking goes. They also feel buybacks disproportionately enrich managers at the expense of employees. In his State of the Union address, President Biden called for quadrupling the tax on share repurchases.
Warren Buffett isn't buying that argument. In his annual letter to shareholders, the billionaire C.E.O. of Berkshire Hathaway said to beware the buyback detractor -- who is either an "economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue."
Who's right? DealBook reviewed the research and spoke to buyback experts. Here's what we found:
Buybacks can be a boon for investors. According to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America, investors tend to reward companies that execute repurchases by, yep, buying more stock. Over the past five years, share prices went up for nearly 55 percent of the 2,997 companies tracked by Bank of America that repurchased shares.
More evidence supporting buybacks:
Repurchases signal to Wall Street that the company has a healthy balance sheet, and that attracts more investor interest, said Luis Garcia-Feijoo, research director at the CFA Institute Research Foundation. Exhibit A: Salesforce's shares soared on Thursday after the company announced that it would buy back $ 20 billion worth of shares. Exhibit B: Meta's stock also spiked when it made a similar announcement last month.
Investors tend to view buybacks more favorably than dividends. One reason: The former tend to carry a relatively light or imperceptible tax hit, Mr. Garcia-Feijoo said.
Buybacks don't work for all companies. (Even Mr. Buffett admits this.) Shareholders tend to punish companies that repurchase shares that are already too pricey. Subramanian calculates that the 50 biggest companies in the S&P 500 are overvalued. For them, buybacks don't make as much sense.
Companies may be buying back too many shares. Companies announced plans to buy more than $ 1.2 trillion of their own stock last year and could come close to, or surpass, that this year. Firms are spending roughly 90 percent of their earnings on buybacks and dividends, according to Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the National Economic Council. Some market pros are having second thoughts, too. In a December survey of global fund managers by Bank of America, 56 percent said they would prefer that the C.E.O. used excess funds to shore up the balance sheet; just 16 percent said they wanted to see more buybacks.
The verdict? According to Mr. Garcia-Feijoo, a prevailing view is emerging: "Buybacks are not so bad." Mr. Buffett wins the argument, he says.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Dilbert gets a pink slip. Hundreds of newspapers cut the cartoon strip that mocks office culture after its creator, Scott Adams, described Black people as a "hate group" and said white people should "just get the hell away from them." Mr. Adams said he was using hyperbole and complained that he had been "canceled." Not quite -- he is still able to publish content, even if most media outlets want nothing to do with him.
Netflix goes live. The streaming platform announced two firsts: a livestreamed Chris Rock stand-up comedy show and a live stage production, "Stranger Things: The First Shadow," to be held in London this year. The company previously experimented with immersive experiences linked to franchises including "Bridgerton," "Squid Game" and "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery."
Tick Tock for TikTok. The Chinese short video app introduced a one-hour time limit for users who are under 18. The move was announced days after the Biden administration, Canada and the European Union banned the social media powerhouse from government phones over concerns that the company may put sensitive information in the hands of the Chinese government.
Salesforce discovers its profit motive. The software group, grappling with six activist investors, reported better-than-expected earnings, sending its share price soaring. Marc Benioff, the C.E.O., was joyful in a round of interviews with journalists and on a call with analysts. He said Salesforce was now putting a priority on profits and efficiency over growth. (A nonchalant admission that raises the question: What took it so long?)
The newsmaker: Nir Bar Dea
Bridgewater's C.E.O., Nir Bar Dea, unveiled a long-awaited revamp of the world's biggest hedge fund this week, five months after its founder, Ray Dalio, ceded control. The sweeping changes include expanding in Asia, cutting nearly 8 percent of its work force and capping the size of its flagship Pure Alpha fund to $ 70 billion.
A new C.E.O. for a new era. "I know for a lot of people -- I'm not necessarily what they would be expecting," Bar Dea told Bloomberg last year. "I don't sound like it, look like it, the role of the C.E.O. of Bridgewater." In 2020, Fortune named Mr. Bar Dea one of its "40 Under 40" in finance.
Mr. Bar Dea's grandparents are from Libya, Poland and Hungary. He grew up in Israel and says the country's transformation underpins his own ambition. "I saw a nation be built almost from the ground up in my lifetime," he told Forbes.
Previous experience: the army, diplomacy and start-ups. Mr. Bar Dea was a platoon leader in the Israeli Defense Forces. He later founded a drone company and has said shutting it down was one of the most formative events of his career. Mr. Bar Dea later ran real estate for a restaurant company called Dishes, and in 2014 he took a role as adviser and speechwriter to the Israeli mission to the United Nations. He has an M.B.A. from Wharton.
Mr. Bar Dea arrived at a pivotal moment. He joined Bridgewater in 2015 after being contacted by Karen Karniol-Tambour, a co-chief investment officer, and started as a management associate in the research and analytics unit -- just as the firm was beginning to plan for a future without its founder. When he came to Bridgewater, he said, that's when "the journey of transitioning," began. "It was the beginning of thinking about how we're going to transition our investment oversight from Ray Dalio to the next generation."
$ 300 million
-- London's high-end property watchers are agog over a palatial mansion that just went on the market. Its sale could set a record, fetching as much as 250 million pounds ( $ 300 million). The crown for most expensive London property is held by a Chinese billionaire property developer who bought a mansion overlooking Hyde Park for £210 million in 2020. Move fast -- bids are already pouring in on the Regent's Park abode.
Fed watching
In the early days of the Covid pandemic, the Federal Reserve pulled out all the stops. It slashed the prime lending rate to near zero and spent roughly $ 5 trillion buying up Treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities and pumping liquidity into America's banking system.
The moves helped limit the pandemic's economic toll and ignited a bull market stock rally that carried the mantra "Don't fight the Fed." In her new book, "Limitless: The Federal Reserve Takes On a New Age of Crisis," The Times's Jeanna Smialek takes on, and demystifies, the world's most powerful central bank. The interview has been edited and condensed:
What is the party pitch for a book on central banking?
The Fed matters to you, to your life, to markets, your retirement portfolio, and it increasingly matters for our democratic system of capitalism.
Why is the Fed especially important right now?
The Fed really expanded its footprint during the 2008 financial crisis and especially in 2020 during the pandemic. It has been doing things that extend beyond traditional monetary policy.
Is this a positive evolution?
It's almost a historic inevitability in response to changing circumstances. But the institution has a lot of power and few checks on it, and there may be a point when we decide there should be more firm limits. We should be watching and talking about what it's doing and where we're going.
What risks does it face?
Efforts to politicize the Fed, particularly. There have been similar efforts since its founding, but the risks are greater now because it has so much power.
How will it respond to the next crisis?
What we tend to see is that once it uses a tool, it could use it again even though it may have been touted as "once in a lifetime." In the pandemic, the Fed created a local government lending facility, which was very unusual and had never been done. We might see that again.
What do you wish more people would consider?
Ten years ago, none of us were paying much attention to the Supreme Court as it was becoming a more important force in society. We're at the same point with the Fed. We should not wait to understand it.
On our radar: Artifact
Built by the co-founders of Instagram, Artifact is an app that aims to do for text what TikTok has done for video: learn what users (with the help of artificial intelligence), and serve up a personalized feed of news articles and posts. Its main tab is even called "For You."
In some ways, it's a modern twist on aggregated news feeds like Google Reader (R.I.P.). Over several days of testing -- the app was made publicly available late last month -- Artifact has slowly begun to learn what might be of interest, though its guesses haven't always been perfect.

Amazon Pauses Work On Campus In Virginia: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The delay is the latest reminder that the tech industry's pandemic-fueled boom has slowed and another indicator of how remote work has changed office-space needs.
When Amazon said in 2018 that it planned to build a second headquarters in Virginia, along with a sister office complex in New York, it was a symbolic moment for the tech industry's increasing importance to the American economy.
But the company's decision made public on Friday to pause plans in Virginia -- about four years after Amazon pulled out of its campus in New York -- is the latest reminder that the tech industry's long boom has slowed.
It is also another indication that the pandemic may have permanently changed office work, presenting new challenges to communities that had counted on the growth of tech offices.
The decision to delay a large part of the prominent construction project, which it called HQ2, came as Amazon and other big tech employers have made the most significant cuts to their work forces in at least 15 years.
The companies are also struggling to figure out what to do with their offices as their workers continue to spend at least part of the time working from home. Nearly three years after the pandemic shut down workplaces, few tech companies have required their employees to return to the office full time.
"For HQ2 to be on pause is emblematic of the pause that tech has hit all across the industry," said Jeffrey D. Shulman, a marketing professor at the University of Washington who has researched Amazon's impact on Seattle, its hometown. "HQ2 is the perfect emblem of where we were and where we are, and just how different they are."
The HQ2 project has several clusters of development in Virginia, just over the Potomac River from Washington. The pause will affect PenPlace, the second and larger stage, which would build a mix of office towers, open space and a signature, spiraling glass building Amazon calls the Helix.
Construction on the first phase, a nearby complex known as Met Park, contains two office towers and is scheduled to open for employees in June.
The pullback makes future investments by developers and small business uncertain, Mr. Shulman said. "It has rippling effects where there is now shaken confidence in something that seemed like a can't miss when they announced it," he said.
The construction delay was reported earlier by Bloomberg News and confirmed on Friday by Amazon's real estate chief, John Schoettler. "We're always evaluating space plans to make sure they fit our business needs," he said in a statement.
He said the company had already hired more than 8,000 employees in HQ2 and planned to eventually bring 25,000 corporate and tech jobs to the region.
After Amazon rapidly expanded to meet the pandemic's boom in online shopping and services, Andy Jassy, who took over as Amazon's chief executive in July 2021, has spent the past year pushing the company to trim costs.
Last summer, amid the cost-cutting and uncertainty of how hybrid work would shake out, Amazon put the brakes on building several towers in Bellevue, Wash., near its headquarters in Seattle. It had planned to have space for 25,000 employees in the new offices.
Then in November, Amazon began plans to layoff about 10,000 workers, only to expand the number of layoffs in January to 18,000.
Tech companies, roiled by their biggest work force contraction since the dot-com bust and continued remote work, have pulled back on their expansion plans, which has allowed them reduce real estate costs.
Google backed out of a large project to build space for 6,000 workers near Seattle as it announced layoffs in January, and Microsoft has delayed some work on its overhaul of its headquarters campus. Yelp vacated its headquarters in San Francisco, where Salesforce has cut back on leases as well.
The pullback, combined with the persistence of employees working remotely, has hobbled cities that relied on tech workers to frequent cafes, doggy day cares, and transit.
Last month, Mr. Jassy wrote in a letter to employees that most corporate staff would be expected to return to the office three days a week starting on May 1. It caused grumbling from many Amazon workers, but cheering from city officials in Seattle and Bellevue.
"Events really did change," said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto who has studied urban development and tech for more than two decades. "We did have a pandemic, remote work became a thing. But I think this is yet another cautionary tale, perhaps the ultimate cautionary tale, of not betting a whole community on a company."
The slowdown at Amazon's HQ2 is perhaps the most indicative of how quickly the tides have changed from its ambitions of just a few years ago. Amazon kicked off an international frenzy in 2017 when it announced its search for a second headquarters, saying it wanted to find a place where it could expand to house 50,000 employees. Hundreds of cities and towns around North America threw themselves at Amazon, hoping to attract what were seen as well-paid jobs of the future.
But long-shot hopes were dashed in late 2018, when Amazon announced that it would be split the second headquarters equally between Queens and Arlington, Va., two metro areas where Amazon already had more employees than anywhere else outside of Seattle and the Bay Area.
At the time, the company said that the developments would require $ 5 billion in construction and other investments. Amazon was offered more than $ 2 billion in tax incentives from New York and Virginia.
The tax breaks, and concerns over gentrification, caused fierce community, union and political pushback over the campus in Long Island City, and in early 2019, Amazon canceled its plans for the Queens campus.
The company said it might still pursue permits and other pre-construction work on the second phase of the project in Virginia later this year.
"We continue to work with Amazon to advance plans for Pen Place, and look forward to helping Amazon realize its complete vision for HQ2," Matt Kelly, the chief executive of JBG Smith, the developer of the project, said in a statement.

Market Gains After 3 Days of Losses: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/market-gains-after-3-days-losses/docview/2781441361/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks rose Thursday for their first gain in three days, even as bond yields climbed to tighten the squeeze on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent after erasing a morning loss. The Dow Jones industrial average added 1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.7 percent.
Stocks flipped from losses to gains after a Federal Reserve official made comments that raised hopes the central bank may not ramp up its fight against inflation as aggressively as feared. That countered recent talk from other officials who raised worries about much bigger increases to interest rates following several hotter-than-expected reports on the economy.
Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, told reporters that for now he still supports lifting the Fed's key overnight rate to a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent, up from its current 4.50 percent to 4.75 percent. That's lower than a good chunk of investors on Wall Street are forecasting.
"That's what gave the market a little hope, that there is a voice not saying to raise the terminal rate," or where the Fed will ultimately stop raising rates, said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth, "because a lot of the other people who talk seem like they're constantly saying: 'Elevator Up."'
The mood was more dour in the morning after a report showed fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week for a third straight week. It's the latest data to show the job market remains more resilient than expected, even though the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates at the fastest pace in decades.
A separate report Thursday showed labor costs were higher than earlier reported for the last three months of 2022, while productivity was revised down. Both could also add pressure on inflation. It follows other reports over the last month showing overall job growth, spending by consumers and inflation at multiple levels of the economy all remain higher than expected.
"The economy is pretty healthy and from a spending perspective that actually provides a lot of support for earnings estimates ticking up," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. "The other side of that though is that the Fed sees it too and the market sees that the Fed is seeing it."
The strong economic reports have forced Wall Street to raise its forecasts for how high the Fed will ultimately take interest rates. It also means a delay in any hopes for upcoming cuts to rates.
The swing has been clear in the bond market, where Treasury yields have shot higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.08 percent from 4 percent late Wednesday and from less than 3.40 percent earlier this year. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans that shape the economy, and it's near its highest level since November.
Shares of Salesforce soared 11.5 percent for one of the market's biggest gains after it topped forecasts for profit and revenue last quarter. It also gave a stronger-than-expected forecast for upcoming results.
Expectations have been coming down recently for profits at big U.S. companies given still-high inflation and interest rates. But several joined Salesforce in rising Thursday after posting encouraging results.
Macy's rose 11.1 percent after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the holidays than analysts expected. It also gave a forecast range for earnings this year that was above some analysts' expectations.
It ran counter to several other big retailers that have offered discouraging forecasts recently given the struggles of some U.S. households amid high inflation.
On the losing side was Tesla, which sank 5.9 percent. It said its next generation of vehicles will cost half as much but provided few details about its design in a presentation to investors.

The Busy Furniture Hustlers of Silicon Valley: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As tech companies cut costs and move to remote work, their left-behind office furniture has become part of a booming trade.
Brandi Susewitz touched the curved stitching on a pair of bright red Arne Jacobsen Egg Chairs and announced they were worth around $ 5,000 each. The chairs were in pristine condition, perched in the reception area of the software company Sitecore's office in downtown San Francisco.
Trisha Murcia, Sitecore's workplace manager, said she was likely the only person who ever sat on them. "It's really sad," she said. "They opened this office in 2018 and then Covid happened."
Ms. Murcia led Ms. Susewitz around Sitecore's office, pointing out bar stools that had never been used, 90-inch flat screens, shiny conference room tables and accent chairs from the retailer Blu Dot. The whiteboard walls, outfitted with markers and erasers, were spotless. And rows upon rows of 30-by-60-inch, height-adjustable Knoll desks with Herman Miller Aeron chairs sat collecting dust.
Ms. Susewitz measured and snapped photos, identifying designer brands and models. Her office furniture resale business, Reseat, would take all of it, she declared. "We can find a home for this," she said. "We have time."
Ms. Susewitz, who started Reseat in 2020, is one of an increasing number of behind-the-scenes specialists in the Bay Area who are carving out a piece of the great office furniture reshuffling. There are professional liquidators, Craigslist flippers and start-ups spouting buzzwords like "circular economy." And a few guys with warehouses full of really nice chairs.
All of them are capitalizing on a wave of tech companies that are drastically shrinking their physical footprints in the wake of the pandemic-induced shift to remote work and the recent economic slowdown.
Nowhere is the furniture glut stronger than in San Francisco. Tech workers have been slowest to return to the office in the city, where commercial vacancy rates jumped to 28 percent last year, up from 4 percent in 2019, according to the real estate firm CBRE. Occupancy in San Francisco in late January was 4 percent below the average of the top 10 U.S. cities, according to the building security firm Kastle. And companies of all sizes, including PayPal, Block and Yelp, are giving up their expensive downtown headquarters or downsizing their office space.
Add to that the tech industry's recent U-turn from optimistic hypergrowth to fear and penny pinching. That has led tech giants such as Google and Salesforce, along with smaller companies like DoorDash and Wish, to carry out widespread layoffs, cutting more than 88,000 workers in the Bay Area over the last year, according to Layoffs.fyi.
Some start-ups have abruptly gone under, including the flying car company Kittyhawk, the autonomous vehicle start-up Argo AI and the interior design start-up Modsy. Others have slashed spending, starting with their dusty, rarely used offices full of designer furniture.
Last month, Twitter held a public auction for some of its furniture, hawking dry erase boards, conference tables and a three-foot blue statue of its bird logo. The social media company, which is owned by Elon Musk, at one point stopped paying the rent on some of its office leases.
Martin Pichinson, a founder of Sherwood Partners, an advisory firm that helps restructure failing start-ups, said he was staffing up to handle increased demand. Today's reckoning was not as severe as that of the dot-com bust in the early 2000s when dozens of tech companies collapsed, he said, but "everyone is acting as if businesses are falling apart."
That's led to a lot of expendable furniture, much of it hewing to a specific youthful aesthetic of Instagrammable bright colors and midcentury modern shapes. That look, complemented by plant walls of succulents and kombucha on tap, was a hallmark of the tech talent wars over the past two decades, telegraphing a company's success and sophistication.
Then there's the Aeron chairs. The $ 1,805 black roller-wheel desk chairs are a closely-watched barometer of tech excesses. Their sleek design makes them a work of art, according to the Museum of Modern Art. And in the tech industry, where workers are used to being pampered while chained to their desks, they are ubiquitous.
When internet companies imploded in 2000, liquidators filled their warehouses with the "dot-com thrones." Now any whiff of empty Aerons piling up conjures memories of that slump and sets off fears that another is imminent.
The Bay Area's Craigslist currently has gobs of the chairs for sale, photographed in warehouses, lined up in corners of conference rooms and wrapped in plastic outside a storage unit. Some are selling for as cheap as a few hundred bucks.
The listings are a reminder: Silicon Valley is a place of booms and busts, with enterprising hustlers who see nothing but opportunity, even in the rubble.
A trail of Dropbox furniture
For furniture specialists, it all starts with supplies from tech companies like Dropbox.
In 2019, the file storage company moved into its 735,000-square-foot headquarters in San Francisco. Its 15-year lease was the largest in the city's history at the time. Dropbox's old office was rented to other companies, and last year, a cache of furniture -- futuristic-chic chairs, couches and tables -- from that office made its way to a liquidator.
The inventory included several emerald green velvet Jean Royère-style Polar Bear chairs that cost roughly $ 10,000 to custom make in 2016, according to their maker, Classic Design LA.
Three of those chairs sold to Tenzin Norbu, a furniture reseller in Richmond, Calif., who paid around $ 1,000 for each. Mr. Norbu, 25, started buying and selling high-end furniture on online marketplaces early in the pandemic, when people were eager to redecorate the homes they were stuck inside and stymied by supply chain delays on furniture.
Since then, his business, called Enliven, has expanded to include a van, three employees, a 4,000-square-foot warehouse and annual revenue in the mid-six figures.
The tech talent wars, with companies competing to out-perk one another with the fanciest offices, were good for designer furniture. The retreat from that battle has been just as good for resellers.
Last year, Mr. Norbu scored some lounge chairs and couches from Fast, a payments start-up that collapsed in the spring. He also paid "tens of thousands" of dollars, he said, to fill a 20-foot truck of still-in-the-box furniture that WeWork, whose valuation had plummeted, had kept in storage since 2019. The trove included dining chairs, lamps, couches and a chunky red Bollo armchair by the Swedish designer Fogia.
On a recent tour of his warehouse, Mr. Norbu pointed out a pair of never-used felt poufs from a start-up, two glass coffee tables from Delta Air Lines, some gray lounge chairs that were "probably from Google" and plants from a venture capital firm.
Mr. Norbu aims to target more tech start-ups as his business expands. The companies are always acquiring or shedding furniture, since they tend to grow quickly and shut down abruptly. Many of his buyers also work in tech, he said, which means they could find themselves eating dinner at the very conference table they once gathered around for meetings.
Last year, Mr. Norbu sold one of the Polar Bear chairs that had been owned by Dropbox to a fellow furniture flipper, Nate Morgan, for $ 1,400. Mr. Morgan started trading furniture in the fall after he was laid off from a business development job at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. He said he quickly discovered the Bay Area contains "crazy pockets of massive amounts of furniture."
Mr. Morgan's business, Reclamation, recently worked with a wealthy tech entrepreneur who had bought a second San Francisco home to live in while his main home was being renovated. The entrepreneur furnished the 4,000-square-foot second home with new goods from Restoration Hardware. Nine months later, when the entrepreneur moved into his main home, Mr. Morgan bought all of the second home's furniture for 10 percent of its retail price.
Mr. Morgan, 44, said the furniture business was a welcome shift from the 15 years he spent working in tech. "It feels really good to be building a local community business that's tied to this geographic area," he said.
Mr. Morgan later sold the Polar Bear chair that had been at Dropbox for a profit to an interior designer in Los Angeles, who then sold it to a client in the Hollywood Hills. From the liquidator, to Mr. Norbu, to Mr. Morgan, to the interior designer, each person in the chain made a little money.
Dropbox declined to comment. During the pandemic, the company shifted to remote work and made plans to sublet 80 percent of its headquarters. Takers have been slow; the company recently lowered its expected rate, pushed out its target for finding tenants by two years and recorded a $ 175 million charge on its real estate holdings in 2022.
Dropbox's remaining space has been converted into what the company calls a "studio" instead of an "office," designed for meetings and "touchdown spots," or cafes and libraries for people to sit, chat and work briefly. There are no more desks.
'It was a ghost town'
Ms. Susewitz, 49, has worked in office furniture since 1997, when she became a customer service representative at Lindsay-Ferrari, a Bay Area furniture dealer now known as One Workplace.
The furniture industry's wastefulness always bugged her, she said, with companies discarding durable, commercial-grade items that were built to last decades every time they moved. Companies waited until the last minute to deal with the furniture, she said, increasing the odds it wound up in the trash.
In the late 1990s dot-com boom, Ms. Susewitz created a business plan to build an online marketplace for used office furniture. She abandoned it when eBay took off, thinking the company would eventually solve the problem. "But that never happened," she said.
Over the next two decades, she worked in sales and business development, outfitting Bay Area businesses with goods from "the big five" of workplace furniture -- Steelcase, MillerKnoll, Haworth, Allsteel and Teknion.
When the pandemic hit, Ms. Susewitz's livelihood of new office furniture screeched to a halt. She watched with disgust as companies tossed out barely used desks and chairs.
"Perfectly good, brand-new furniture is just being carted off to landfills," she said.
So she created Reseat to help businesses liquidate furniture. The company uses an inventory management system that tracks the items' "life cycles" so it can quickly share the specifications for the furniture, making the goods easier to sell. Given enough time, sellers can expect 20 cents on the dollar for their furniture, she said. Reseat, which has 14 employees, has worked with more than 100 companies and sold more than eight million pounds of furniture.
"Our goal is to sell it standing," Ms. Susewitz said. "Once it ends up in a warehouse, it loses value and ends up collecting dust."
In December, Reseat was hired to liquidate more than 900 work stations, 96 office chairs, 40 work benches, 24 sofas and 84 file cabinets at an office in Santa Clara, Calif. Analog Devices, the semiconductor company that had moved out, hardly used the space during the pandemic. But Pure Storage, the data storage company moving in, didn't want those pieces. Reseat had just four weeks to sell the items.
"It just ate me up inside," Ms. Susewitz said. That she found buyers in time was "a miracle," she added.
Pure Storage said it was reusing a "substantial" amount of Analog Devices' furniture, including desk chairs and conference room items, but it planned to install its existing desks "to better suit how Pure employees work in a more open office environment." An Analog Devices representative declined to comment.
Ms. Susewitz was excited about the furniture at Sitecore because the company had contacted Reseat months ahead of its move, setting it up to easily find a home for its goods. At Sitecore's office, she showed off how to identify the size of an Aeron chair. Each one has a set of plastic bumps hidden on its back. Two bumps indicate the most common size, a "B."
There were 16 size Bs around a wooden conference table that Sitecore had built using wood from a houseboat that was in Sausalito, Calif. In the center, a basin filled with Legos was flanked by the universal emblems of the pandemic: a bottle of Purell and a package of Clorox wipes.
Before the pandemic, Sitecore was expanding its space so rapidly that it had leased another half of a floor in its office tower. But "once the pandemic hit, it was a ghost town," said Brad Hamilton, the company's head of real estate and facilities.
Sitecore plans to downgrade to 30 desks from 170. "We're paying an outrageous amount of money for a floor that nobody uses," he said.
Toward the end of the office tour, Ms. Susewitz surveyed Sitecore's empty kitchen area, outfitted with a Ping-Pong table, a Ms. Pac-Man machine and two curved, six-foot privacy coves. Ms. Susewitz said she would take everything, except for the plates and silverware.
Chair influencers
One result of the furniture trading is a lot more people logging into Zoom meetings from very nice chairs -- and not only in the Bay Area.
In January, Gilad Rom, a software engineer in Los Angeles, decided to upgrade his work station at home. He searched Craigslist and found a seller with 500 Aeron chairs -- apparently acquired from a SiriusXM office that had shifted to remote work -- in Culver City, Calif.
When he posted a picture of the chairs gathered in a room, their black foam arms intertwined, the reaction was explosive. Some people wanted to score their own cheap Aeron. Many more wanted to reminisce about what the empty chairs represented -- corporate excess gone awry.
"I think it brought back a lot of memories," Mr. Rom, 43, said. "Flashbacks from 2008 and 2000."
The seller, a secondhand furniture shop called Wannasofa, was so overwhelmed with calls after Mr. Rom's tweet that the store gave him a 25 percent discount. "Apparently I'm a chair influencer now," he said.
The reaction also gave him an idea.
"Maybe I should build an app that helps people find cheap luxury furniture," he said. "Maybe there's something there."

When Ray Dalio, the multibillionaire founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, announced his retirement in October, both he and the firm he founded more than four decades ago treated the moment as celebratory.
Dalio, 73, told his millions of followers on LinkedIn that he felt “great about the people” to whom he had handed the reins. And one of Bridgewater’s two new CEOs, Nir Bar Dea, sent an enthusiastic note to clients: “The transition from Ray is done!”
But neither Dalio, known for his creed of “radical transparency,” nor Bridgewater said at the time, or since, that he had hardly gone without a fight. His exit — partly spurred by controversial remarks he had made on television about China’s human rights record — followed more than six months of frantic behind-the-scenes wrangling over how much money his successors at the firm were willing to pay the billionaire to go away.
In the end, Dalio, with an estimated net worth of $19 billion, agreed to surrender his control over all key decisions at Bridgewater only if the firm agreed to give him what could amount to billions of dollars in regular payouts over the coming years through a special class of stock.
These secret arrangements were described by a half-dozen current and former Bridgewater employees who said they risked angering Dalio and could be sued by the firm if they spoke publicly. At an internal meeting last year during the heat of the exit negotiations, Dalio described the hedge fund as his “property rights,” according to one employee, and indicated that he expected to be compensated accordingly.
Dalio did not respond to requests for comment.
Bridgewater, which manages roughly $125 billion on behalf of public pensions and sovereign wealth funds, is dealing with a situation that’s becoming increasingly common across corporate America. Builders of companies big and small appear unwilling to let go, or are asked to step back in when there is turbulence.
Recently, Marc Benioff, of the technology giant Salesforce, returned to solo leadership of the company he co-founded in 1999 and cut about 8,000 jobs. Howard Schultz, now on his third go-round as the CEO of Starbucks, has appeared intent on crushing efforts across the company to unionize store workers.
Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have stepped in and out of their company several times. And over the summer, Bill Conway, one of the founders of the investing behemoth Carlyle, took the reins after the CEO left abruptly, and helped choose a new one this month.
While battles in the executive suite may seem far removed from the concerns of everyday American workers, strife in upper management often creates havoc lower in the ranks. In the investing world, upheaval can be such a distraction that fund performance suffers, squeezing retirees and others who count on steady returns from their investment managers.
Many founders, even after selling off a majority of their company, retain power because they hold a special class of shares that give them more voting rights than regular shares and allow them to maintain control over company decisions.
Dalio’s relationship with Bridgewater goes well beyond that. He has been the firm’s CEO, chief investment officer and chair — sometimes solo, sometimes with partners and sometimes all at once.
At the same time, Dalio has portrayed himself publicly as a management guru of sorts, promoting an unusual workplace philosophy that he calls “radical transparency.” The gist of it is that Bridgewater tapes most of its employee meetings and broadcasts them firmwide, as evidence that it is a place where hard truths can be spoken about openly.
He has discussed how he ranks employees in categories such as “willingness to touch the nerve” and “quick to learn from mistakes.” Under his direction, Bridgewater spent millions of dollars on custom iPad software for employees to rank each other in real time on a 1-to-10 scale in dozens of personality categories.
In 2017, Dalio published “Principles,” a bestselling book that laid out his leadership rules. (“Be willing to ‘shoot the people you love,’” read one.) He has since become a regular speaker at TED conferences and is prolific on Twitter.
Dalio and Bridgewater rolled out his retirement plans more than a decade ago, in 2009, when he told the firm and its clients that he would begin to turn over his responsibilities. That proved easier said than done. Bridgewater cycled through a seemingly endless group of would-be CEOs as Dalio found reasons to reject nearly all of them, and vice versa.
One former co-CEO, Eileen Murray, sued the firm for discrimination after she left in 2020, a matter later settled out of court. She had shared the role with David McCormick, who resigned a little over a year ago to run in the Republican primary in Pennsylvania for the Senate, which he lost.
All the while, Dalio sent mixed signals on whether he would stay or go, telling staff and investors that he would leave only when he was certain that the right leadership was in place.
In mid-2018, Bridgewater said it would become a partnership as part of a long-term plan to move away from founder control. In theory, that should have transformed the firm into an entity controlled by its top employees rather than one man.
But Dalio wasted little time in telling colleagues that he was not interested in a simple passing of the baton, according to current and former employees. He approached dozens of top employees — at the time, Bridgewater had roughly 1,500 full-time staff members — and told them they would have to buy his shares with their own money, some of those employees said.
Dalio offered to arrange 10-year loans to those who lacked the funds to buy him out, according to two former employees. If they declined, he intimated that they should consider leaving the firm, they said. Still, even as he sold shares to his colleagues, decreasing his ownership, his founder shares kept him in control.
Dalio didn’t recede from public view either, often attracting criticism. In a CNBC interview in fall 2021, Dalio dismissed concerns about China’s human rights track record, likening the country’s government to a “strict parent.” (Bridgewater manages billions of dollars for companies partly owned by the Chinese government.)
“Should I not invest in the United States because of our own human rights leadership?” he asked.
The comments attracted reproach from Washington, where Sen. Mitt Romney labeled them a “sad moral lapse.” Clients called Bridgewater, asking whether Dalio’s views represented those of the firm, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The firm never addressed the matter publicly, though Dalio later said he had spoken sloppily.
The brouhaha did not appear to soften his views. Inside Bridgewater, Dalio reasserted a rule dictating that he personally must review and edit the firm’s widely read economic newsletter, called the Daily Observations, for any mentions of China, lest others tone down his praise, one of the people said.
By then, although some at Bridgewater retained a fondness for Dalio and his history at the firm, others were apoplectic. That left Bar Dea, one of the co-CEOs, with the task of speeding up negotiations to get his boss out for good, two people with knowledge of the matter said. A former major in the Israeli Defense Forces and relative newcomer to the investing world, Bar Dea, now 41, joined Bridgewater in 2015 to perform economic research, and rose swiftly through the ranks.
In January 2022, he was elevated to the top role alongside Mark Bertolini, former CEO of Aetna, though current and former employees say it is Bar Dea who mainly deals with Dalio.
The back-and-forth between Dalio and Bridgewater’s senior leaders stretched on for much of 2022, with Dalio insisting that he would not simply hand over his life’s work.
Finally, the two sides agreed on a steep price. Dalio would surrender his titles, take on a new role as “mentor to the CIOs and investment committee,” and remain a member of the hedge fund’s board, according to an announcement by Bridgewater. (Last month, Bridgewater told clients that Bertolini would give up his co-CEO role to become a “CEO mentor.”)
Dalio also received a new, special class of personal stock that the firm informally calls “Ray’s shares,” which pay him the equivalent of a hefty dividend before anyone else at the firm is paid, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
Based on those arrangements — as well as how long Dalio lives, and how long Bridgewater survives — the payouts could reach billions of dollars.
Although Bridgewater delivered handsome returns for investors for the first three quarters of 2022, the firm’s flagship fund slumped in the fourth quarter, just months after Dalio’s departure in October. It fell an additional 7% in January, while stocks rose sharply.
That puts sharp pressure on the firm to turn things around. Bridgewater no longer posts its assets under management on its website. From its peak of around $160 billion, the amount was down to around $125 billion late last year, according to people familiar with the firm.
In the meantime, Bar Dea has begun dismantling some parts of Dalio’s legacy. Bridgewater dropped many of his “Principles,” and their associated ratings tools. Giving unvarnished feedback to one another — a stalwart of Dalio’s “radical transparency” — is now optional, current employees said.
Still, some of Bar Dea’s changes have a hint of the hedge fund’s old ways. He has recently taken to telling employees that he is coming up with his own list of “Principles.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Spending on Technology Is Steadfast: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite an uncertain outlook, corporations plan to continue investing in their digital projects -- a source of stability for the economy.
Johnson Controls traces its origin to the late 19th century in Wisconsin, where a clever teacher and inventor named Warren Johnson designed an early thermostat to turn the heat on or off in his classroom.
Today, Johnson Controls is an international corporation and, like companies in every industry, increasingly a technology business. The company's software and sensors monitor and manage heating and cooling equipment, fire alarms, security systems and thermostats -- to reduce costs and carbon emissions.
Despite forecasts of a recession, Johnson Controls is not trimming its digital projects, as it seeks to make essential technology for smart buildings. Last year, the company added 500 software engineers and other technical staff to its team of 2,500 software engineers. It plans to hire 350 more tech workers.
"We have to continue to invest," said Vijay Sankaran, chief technology officer of Johnson Controls. "You can't do what we're trying to do without technology."
In recent interviews and surveys, the same theme was struck again and again. The economic outlook is uncertain. Contingency plans are in place. Some initiatives are being trimmed back or slowed down. But business investment in technology remains remarkably resilient, and that trend appears likely to continue in 2023.
In a recent poll of corporate technology managers in the United States by the research firm IDC, 82 percent said they expected a recession this year. But 62 percent replied that technology spending at their companies would be the same or increase compared with 2022.
The managers who shape technology strategy and spending at companies across the country hold an important swing vote in today's economy. Their confidence could help stabilize the economy, even as consumers cut back and Silicon Valley companies trim their payrolls after a period of explosive growth fueled by the pandemic.
Technology plays a larger role in mainstream corporate operations and accounts for a larger share of business investment than in the last two recessions -- in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst and in the 2007-9 financial crisis.
The big difference is software. Business spending on software, including software developed by companies for their own use, more than doubled over the last decade, to $ 567 billion in 2022, according to an analysis of government data by James Bessen, an economist at the Technology & Policy Research Institute at the Boston University School of Law.
That is 37 percent more than businesses spent on factories and industrial equipment combined.
The role of technology, experts say, has also steadily evolved. It is less an electricity-style utility used to automate back-office tasks and more a key ingredient that contributes to a company's revenue and profits.
In recent years, new technologies like cloud computing, data analytics, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity software have become increasingly mainstream. Companies now see them as vital tools for conducting business.
"That's going to be a counterbalance for the economy that didn't exist in the last two downturns," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
At Elevance Health, a big insurer and health services provider, the ever-larger role of information technology is apparent. Eighty percent of the communication contacts with the more than 45 million people the company covers are now through its website, mobile app or online chatbot. Five years ago, about 30 percent were handled on its digital channels.
Elevance, which last year changed its name from Anthem, employs a technology work force that numbers in the tens of thousands, including software engineers, user experience designers, data scientists and A.I. experts.
They work on automating tasks like authorizations for medical procedures and claims adjudication. They are also building the software to deliver personalized recommendations for treatments and health advice to medical professionals and individuals.
That goal, said Rajeev Ronanki, a senior vice president of Elevance, is the company's strategic direction. And it can be achieved only by mining and analyzing the insurer's vast stores of billing and clinical data for insights -- a job for teams of skilled tech workers.
A rocky economy may mean the company has to fine-tune its spending plans, Mr. Ronanki said. "But we're laser-focused on investing in our core priorities, and that won't change much regardless of the economy," he said.
Big Tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta are laying off workers. But that is not true of the broader tech economy.
Most technology workers do not work at tech companies. And while employment in tech occupations did slip slightly last month, by half a percentage point, it was 7 percent higher than in January 2022. Nearly 6.5 million people work in tech jobs in America, 430,000 more than a year ago, according to an analysis of government statistics by CompTIA, a technology education and research organization.
The unemployment rate in tech occupations is 1.5 percent, compared with 3.4 percent for all workers.
Even the tech giants, after making layoffs, will have significantly more employees than before the pandemic. Most other companies did not go on wild hiring sprees, but had added steadily to their tech work forces.
JPMorgan Chase, the big bank, has a technology staff of 55,000, up from about 50,000 before the pandemic. It has hired people with skills in cloud computing, data science, A.I. and cybersecurity, and the bank will continue to add people selectively, said Lori Beer, the bank's global chief information officer.
Global technology surveys point to the weakness in spending on hardware. After a pandemic surge, sales of personal computers and smartphones for remote work and to consumers have fallen sharply. Two major technology research firms, Gartner and IDC, have lowered their growth forecasts in recent months, citing a continued slump in personal computers, the turbulent economy and a strong dollar.
But business investment, especially in software, remains fairly strong. John-David Lovelock, Gartner's chief forecaster, said spending was growing in every industry he tracks and called that trend "recession-proof." His counterpart at IDC, Stephen Minton, said business investment in technology was not immune to a downturn but was "more resilient than it's ever been."
Sales of remote cloud computing and software may be slowing, but only from the stratospheric heights of the pandemic. Amazon reported this month that its highly profitable cloud business, Amazon Web Services, the industry leader, was generating revenue at an annual rate of more than $ 80 billion and had grown 20 percent in the fourth quarter. Microsoft, the second-largest cloud company, reported that sales of Azure, its flagship cloud product, had grown 31 percent.
The recent results for technology suppliers to business show a similar pattern. Suppliers focused on helping companies convert to digital operations and cloud computing are doing well, including Accenture, Oracle and ServiceNow. IBM announced job cuts but for businesses it is shedding; its cloud and A.I. sales are strong.
Salesforce, a maker of customer-management software, is cutting jobs and is a target of activist shareholders. But their argument is that Salesforce should reduce expenses to increase profits. The company's revenue grew 14 percent in the most recent quarter.
The relentless advance of software in nearly every industry makes tech spending less cyclical.
Take the car business. A modern automobile is becoming "a vehicle that is really defined by software," said Alan Wexler, a senior vice president for innovation and growth at General Motors.
A sizable portion of the $ 35 billion that G.M. plans to invest in electric and self-driving cars and trucks through 2025 will be spent on software. The code will not only animate the cars, but also transmit entertainment, office-style communications services and automated driving upgrades to vehicles, as they increasingly navigate on their own.
BrightDrop, a G.M. start-up that makes electric cargo vans, relies on software to plan routes, conserve energy and optimize package stacking in its electric delivery pallets. FedEx recently placed an order for 2,000 BrightDrop vans, and Walmart has reserved 5,000.
When G.M. last month announced record profits, the company also said it planned to trim expenses by $ 2 billion over the next two years. It is a prudent step in an uncertain economy, its executives said.
"But we're not slowing down with these software-led growth businesses," Mr. Wexler said.

"You can't do what we're trying to do without technology," said Vijay Sankaran, right, of Johnson Controls.

Full text: Experts say the best way to set boundaries with technology involve sustained effort, not just a break.
Marc Benioff's version of a "digital detox," is more involved than most: The Salesforce chief executive went on a 10-day, device-free vacation to French Polynesia as his company was laying off around 8,000 workers last month. "We are so addicted to our devices (at least I am) it's very freeing to leave them all behind for a while!" he told The New York Times via text message.
But maybe a detox is the wrong metaphor. The phrase, pulled from the language of substance abuse treatment, suggests that "we at least have a sense that there's something wrong here," said Nicholas Carr, whose 2010 book, "The Shallows," was one of the first to explore the cognitive cost of digital distraction. Newer research, he says, has shown the problem isn't only about the time you spend actually looking at your devices. The mere ability to check for messages "is taking up part of our attention all the time."
Here's bad news: Taking a vacation from your phone probably won't solve much. "Leaving Las Vegas for 10 days if you're a problem gambler is great," said Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, the author of books on digital distraction and the importance of rest. "But if on day 11 you're back at the slot machines, then it's not so great." A 2021 review of 21 studies that looked at the effect of digital detoxes on aspects like anxiety and participants' sense of well-being found that most showed either no effect or mixed results at best.
What's more, cutting off all access to technology -- not so hard to imagine in 2010 -- is increasingly impractical, especially if you're not a billionaire with a staff. Even people on vacation "are reliant on mobile phones for so much, from documents to photos," said Matt Berna, the North America president for Intrepid, an adventure travel company that ended its "digital detox" tours in 2018. (It still runs many trips on which you're not likely to catch a Wi-Fi signal.)
That's not to say a digital detox is bad -- it's just not enough. "You really have to figure out how to take breaks within the realities of your daily life," said Adam Gazzaley, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. Like any other habit, he says, "it basically takes repetition and sort of baby-stepping into it."
Experts' recommendations are less exciting than a trip to French Polynesia, though they're certainly less expensive: Turn off your notifications. Set aside an hour of single-tasking time. Put physical distance between yourself and your phone when you don't need it. And understand that although technology companies design their devices to be on your mind all the time, you don't need to follow suit.
"It's sort of like a reframing rather than a detox," Gazzaley said. "It's not that you just do it completely. You do it a little bit at a time."
We want to hear from you: How do you set boundaries with your devices? If not a "digital detox," what would you call your strategy? Let us know here .
ON OUR MINDS
How will Microsoft tweak its new A.I. chatbot? Users have reported creepy interactions with the bot persona that is part of the company's revamped Bing search engine. In response, Microsoft said it would limit the length of conversations. Will it put more guardrails in place?
What will happen to Don Lemon? The CNN morning-show anchor was rebuked by the network's chairman on Friday after he said on air that Nikki Haley, the 51-year-old Republican presidential candidate, "isn't in her prime."
Will Bitcoin continue its comeback? The cryptocurrency hit an eight-month high on Thursday, despite signs of a broadening crypto crackdown.
Who will be the Fed's new vice chair? President Biden appointed the Federal Reserve's Lael Brainard to be his top economic adviser this week, but has yet to name her replacement. One person reportedly in the running is Austan Goolsbee, the Chicago Fed President, whose position on interest rates is more centrist than Brainard's dovish stance.
How to sound smart at a party: ChatGPT
Just when you have finally caught up on crypto, small talk has turned to ChatGPT, a massively popular chatbot that has kicked off an A.I. arms race at big tech companies. If you don't have time to understand the complicated technology under the hood, never fear: We asked Kevin Roose, a technology columnist at The Times, for some lines to use (and avoid) in a conversation.
Say this: "ChatGPT's versatility is amazing, but I wonder if large language models can ever solve the hallucination problem."
Why? Chatbots like ChatGPT generate new text, and they don't care whether it's true or not. As Kevin found out in a conversation with Bing's A.I. chatbot this week in which the A.I. professed its love for him, sometimes the stuff they make up can be disturbing.
Don't say this: "I use ChatGPT for math."
Why? The technology works by scanning massive amounts of text and then developing a model to predict which words come next in a sentence. But it's notoriously error-prone at crunching numbers, hallucinating wrong answers (see above) while insisting it's correct.
"There's no contact, I don't have 300-pound guys falling on top of me. It's just a matter of shooting the lowest score."
-- Tiger Woods, on why the nature of golf makes it possible to ignore ordinary retirement timelines for athletes .
Taking down a Chinese spy balloon, by the numbers
The downing of a Chinese spy balloon and three takedowns of mysterious (but likely innocuous) U.F.O.s continue to transfix the public. Little is known about the military operations that intercepted these objects flying over the United States and Canada -- but we do know they weren't exactly cheap.
$ 143 million: The price of an F-22 Raptor, the plane built by Lockheed Martin and Boeing that was used in the first three takedowns. It's considered one of the most expensive fighter planes ever built.
$ 439,000: The price of one Raytheon AIM-9X sidewinder, the type of missile used to shoot the objects down, according to Bloomberg. The Pentagon used at least five of the missiles.
$ 400 billion: The combined market cap of the three firms -- Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon -- behind these missions. Stock of the latter two are trading near all-time highs, and Boeing's shares are up nearly 10 percent since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Basically zero: The cost of shooting down the balloon and U.F.O.s is "not even a rounding error" in the U.S. military's roughly $ 770 billion budget, according to Zach Rosenberg of Janes, the defense and intelligence firm.
On our radar: $ 1,400 robot shoes
Most people don't think of walking as an outdated technology, but a Pittsburgh start-up called Shift Robotics says "the way we walk is stuck in the past." Positioned as a safer alternative to a scooter or bike, the company's Moonwalkers strap on to normal shoes and increase the speed of walking to about 7 m.p.h., a decent running pace. A reviewer for Fast Company said wearing the shoes, which for now are only available for preorder, "feels a bit like being on a moving walkway." Are the $ 1,400 shoes the next Segway -- a promising high-tech solution to urban transportation that ends up working better as a gimmick -- or the future of micro-mobility? It's hard to know until they start shipping, which the company expects to happen this summer.

A C.E.O.'s Desire to Do Good Meets Hard Economic Reality: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Many years ago, Thich Nhat Hanh, the Buddhist monk and spiritual leader, posed a question to Marc Benioff, the co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce.
"What is more important, being successful or being happy?" he asked.
Mr. Benioff answered pretty much the way you would expect a Silicon Valley entrepreneur to answer.
"Both," he said.
Thich Nhat Hanh cautioned that "if everything is important, nothing is important." But for many years it seemed that Mr. Benioff, just like Silicon Valley itself, was able to have success as well as happiness -- not to mention money, respect and influence.
Salesforce, which makes software to help companies sell better, became a hard-driving and influential tech company, the biggest employer in San Francisco. Mr. Benioff, 58, became a philanthropist, the advocate for a new model of capitalism and, at least in the Bay Area, as inescapable as the 61-story tower that bears his company's name.
Then came 2022. Suddenly Salesforce made less money. The stock wilted. An activist investor, Starboard Value, bought a stake, never good news for management. Mr. Benioff's co-chief executive, Bret Taylor, abruptly departed after only a year in the job. He was the second co-chief executive to do so, leaving the question of succession to Mr. Benioff's 24-year reign at the company in doubt.
Last month, Salesforce said it would lay off 10 percent of its staff, a decision that seemed to go against Mr. Benioff's repeated declarations that the company was one big family. He was chastised on social media for handling the cuts poorly. A second activist investor, Elliott Management, bought a stake in Salesforce. Then another and another and another. For those keeping count, that's five.
"Marc believes you can have a great company, give great returns to your shareholders and help your community and your planet, all at the same time," said Steve Fisher, a longtime Salesforce employee who was also a teenage friend of Mr. Benioff's. "This is one of the times when that notion is being tested."
Salesforce's troubles, like those of many of its tech peers in this moment of turmoil, spring from the pandemic. Three years ago, it looked as if technology might save humanity. For tens of millions of people, tech was suddenly the interface between their couch and their job.
"In the darkest depths of the pandemic, I was like, 'How will we ever get out of this?"' Mr. Benioff said in one of a series of conversations with The New York Times over the past week. Maybe, he thought, we would not. "I felt we were going to be pivoting much more aggressively to an all-digital day."
Salesforce's big pandemic purchase, announced in late 2020, was the remote-work app Slack for $ 28 billion. If everyone was going to stay on Slack all day long forever, it was cheap at that price. But they didn't, and it wasn't.
The troubles at Salesforce may be more wide ranging, but they are mirrored all over the tech industry. About 100,000 tech workers have been laid off since the beginning of the year, according to Layoffs.fyi. That's a rounding error for the larger economy, but these workers were until recently among the best paid and best treated. The notion that free massages, say, might no longer be part of the Silicon Valley experience was yet more evidence that tech was losing its pandemic grip.
Salesforce never offered massages, but its corporate philosophy promotes the idea that its workers are special. A word Mr. Benioff tosses around a lot is "Ohana," which he picked up in Hawaii. "Ohana represents the idea that families -- blood-related, adopted, or intentional -- are bound together, and that family members are responsible for one another," Salesforce's website says.
Mr. Benioff sees no contradiction between layoffs and the Salesforce Ohana. Families are sometimes difficult.
"I wish I offered lifetime employment," he said. "But the reality is when you have a big company with 80,000 employees, there are going to be times you have to make a head count adjustment. Our layoff packages are some of the most generous ever." The dismissed employees got a minimum of nearly five months' pay.
It may have come as a shock to some, he added, but layoffs at Salesforce are nothing new.
"There's been some hard times since we began in 1999," he said. "It's not all up and to the right. But this is the opportunity for growth. If you're in a steady state, you don't grow."
A random sampling of laid-off Salesforce employees contacted through employment sites yielded few who wanted to complain about Mr. Benioff, even anonymously. "I think he got lost somewhere, had too many sycophants telling him what he wanted to hear," one offered. That was as savage as it got.
Mr. Benioff, though, had lots to say, often by text -- sometimes words but also photos, links and emojis. His mother, Joelle, said in an interview that he was "not a big talker" as a child but now has words to spare. At a virtual company meeting after last month's layoffs, he talked for two hours.
Bad idea, he says now.
"We were trying to explain the unexplainable," Mr. Benioff said. "It's hard to have a call like that with such a large group and have it be effective, and we paid a price." Other tech companies didn't bother with hand holding: They just cut off their former employees' access in the middle of the night.
It was a rough month at Salesforce. Mr. Benioff went to one of his favorite places, French Polynesia, for a 10-day digital detox.
"We are so addicted to our devices (at least I am) it's very freeing to leave them all behind for a while!" he wrote in a text.
On an earlier trip, he had contributed $ 1 million in cash to local pandemic relief. For these and other services to the French, he is now a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur. He made his family listen to the speech.
Any conversation with Mr. Benioff inevitably touches on his grandfather Marvin E. Lewis, a San Francisco trial lawyer and politician who was a major force behind BART, the regional transit system.
Mr. Lewis was best known for developing the concept of "psychic injury." His most famous case, in 1970, was called "The Cable Car Named Desire." A dancer, Gloria Sykes, said she had hit her head in a cable car accident, lost her "mental balance" and developed "an insatiable appetite for sex" as well as other problems, including at least one suicide attempt. With Mr. Lewis as her lawyer, Ms. Sykes was awarded $ 50,000 by a jury.
"He was truly a visionary," Mr. Benioff said. "He was in business as a lawyer but made the world a better place." He texted a photo of a tribute to Mr. Lewis in a BART station that calls him "a determined prophet."
If a lawyer can scale these heights, why not a tech executive? Especially if he can make himself happy in the process?
"You're not going to be happy if you're not giving to others," Mr. Benioff said. "A lot of my tech peers are extremely unhappy."
Salesforce, and Mr. Benioff, have undoubtedly made major contributions to the well-being of San Francisco. But more questions are being asked these days about the inherent contradictions of working for the powerful to aid the powerless. As a reviewer on Amazon wrote of Mr. Benioff's book "Trailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change": "Benioff often seems surprised at the scale of the problems in the world, despite many of his customers playing a part in them."
"Marc makes himself a target for criticism by positioning himself as much more than a rampant capitalist tech bro," said Joshua Greenbaum, a software industry analyst with Enterprise Applications Consulting. "But if you don't want your company to pay taxes" -- Salesforce paid no tax, legally, on billions in corporate income -- "what right do you have to lecture people on how to make the world better?"
And if your company is faltering, Mr. Greenbaum said, you have even less right. Mr. Benioff posted more than 30 times on Twitter in January about his initiative to restock the world's forests, a cause he was promoting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. There were no tweets acknowledging Salesforce's turmoil.
"Marc has let the cash cow meander out into the weeds," Mr. Greenbaum said.
That is the logic behind the stakes taken by the activist investors, which also include Third Point, Inclusive Capital and ValueAct Capital. Maybe Mr. Benioff can be compelled to bring the cow home faster, or he can step down in favor of someone who will. None of the activists would comment, but Mr. Benioff would.
"I'm as excited about our future as all our investors are -- I'm a stockholder too!" he texted, adding a heart emoji.
Salesforce shares have rebounded since the layoffs were announced. But to fend off the activists and extend his reign, Mr. Benioff needs to improve profit margins. That quest is likely to prompt more stress in the Salesforce family, perhaps even more layoffs. Which means Thich Nhat Hanh's question still hangs there -- success or happiness?
"What do I really want? The answer is trust," Mr. Benioff said. "Trust from our employees, trust from our customers."
This is, of course, a salesman's answer. From Marc Benioff, would you expect any different?

Full text: Dispatchers for 911 are being inundated with false, automated distress calls from Apple devices owned by skiers who are very much alive.
FRISCO, Colo. -- On a recent sunny Sunday morning, following a night of fluffy snowfall, tens of thousands of skiers flocked to the resorts of Summit County. Just minutes after the lift lines opened, sirens began blaring in the 911 emergency service center, where four staff members were taking calls and dispatching help.
Each jarring alert was a new incoming call, heralding a possible car crash, heart attack or other life-threatening situation. Often, the phone operators heard a chilling sound at the far end of the line: silence, perhaps from a caller too incapacitated to respond.
At 9:07 a.m., one dispatcher, Eric Betts, responded to such a call. From the map on one of the seven monitors on his desk, he could see that the distress call originated from a slope at the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area. Mr. Betts tried calling back. A man picked up.
"Do you have an emergency?" Mr. Betts asked. No, the man said, he was skiing -- safely, happily, unharmed. Slightly annoyed, he added, "For the last three days, my watch has been dialing 911."
Winter has brought a decent amount of snowfall to the region's ski resorts, and with it an avalanche of false emergency calls. Virtually all of them have been placed by Apple Watches or iPhone 14s under the mistaken impression that their owners have been debilitated in collisions.
As of September, these devices have come equipped with technology meant to detect car crashes and alert 911 dispatchers. It is a more sensitive upgrade to software on Apple devices, now several years old, that can detect when a user falls and then dial for help. But the latest innovation appears to send the device into overdrive: It keeps mistaking skiers, and some other fitness enthusiasts, for car-wreck victims.
Lately, emergency call centers in some ski regions have been inundated with inadvertent, automated calls, dozens or more a week. Phone operators often must put other calls, including real emergencies, on hold to clarify whether the latest siren has been prompted by a human at risk or an overzealous device.
"My whole day is managing crash notifications," said Trina Dummer, interim director of Summit County's emergency services, which received 185 such calls in the week from Jan. 13 to Jan. 22. (In winters past, the typical call volume on a busy day was roughly half that.) Ms. Dummer said that the onslaught was threatening to desensitize dispatchers and divert limited resources from true emergencies.
"Apple needs to put in their own call center if this is a feature they want," she said.
Her call center and others have alerted Apple to the issue. In mid-January, the company sent four representatives to observe Ms. Dummer and her team for a day; she said they had plenty of examples to show off.
In a written statement, Alex Kirschner, an Apple spokesman, said, "We have been aware that in some specific scenarios these features have triggered emergency services when a user didn't experience a severe car crash or hard fall." The company noted that when a crash is detected, the watch buzzes and sends a loud warning alerting the user that a call is being placed to 911, and it provides 10 seconds in which to cancel the call.
Apple also said that updates to the software late last year had been intended to "optimize" the technology and reduce the number of false calls. Mr. Kirschner added, "Crash Detection and Fall Detection are designed to get users help when they need it most, and it has already contributed to saving several lives."
Apple maintains a collection of incidents in which the two technologies have come to the rescue. In one case, an Apple Watch alerted the authorities after a driver in Indianapolis had crashed into a telephone pole and the device dialed for assistance. In another, a watch called for help after a New Jersey man fell down a steep cliff while hiking.
In Colorado, call dispatchers had trouble recalling an instance in which a watch had saved a skier in distress. (Ms. Dummer added that her team had "very rarely" received false 911 calls from other companies' devices, such as Android phones.)
The problem extends beyond skiers. "My watch regularly thinks I've had an accident," said Stacey Torman, who works in London at Salesforce and also teaches spin classes. She might be safely on the bike, exhorting her class to ramp up the energy, or waving her arms to congratulate them, when her Apple Watch senses danger.
"I want to celebrate, but my watch really doesn't want me to celebrate," she said. Oh great, she thinks, "now my watch thinks I'm dead."
Recently she fell while racing to catch a bus in the rain. "I went down hard, really hard," she said. Her watch did not call 911, however. "When I did actually fall running for the bus?" she said. "Crickets."
Jon Baron, who works in real estate in Golden, Colo., has an Apple Watch that has twice dialed the authorities. Once, he was at an amusement park playing the strongman game, in which the goal is to hit a lever with a hammer firmly enough to ring a bell. Mr. Baron swung, the bell rang, his wife and children seemed duly impressed -- until "my watch started making this noise like an air-raid siren," he said.
"I was trying to show I was physically able, which I thought I'd demonstrated fairly aptly, but my watch thought different," he added.
Another time, Mr. Baron was in the Tampa airport when the intercom summoned him to a white paging telephone. An emergency services operator at the other end told him his device had dialed 911 for help. Was he OK? "I'm doing all right," he said he had told the operator. "But I have a plane to catch."
Apple introduced fall detection technology in 2018 after developing an algorithm based on the trajectory of a wrist wearing a watch and acceleration at time of impact. Its crash-detection technology, introduced in September, was tested in crash tests and labs on iPhones and Apple Watches.
But something about the way skiers accelerate and stop, or jostle, seems to set the technology on edge. And skiers, in helmets and layers of clothing, often do not to detect the warning, so they may not cancel the call or respond to the 911 dispatcher.
"A lot of people don't feel it or hear it," said Brett Loeb, emergency services communications director in Pitkin County, Colo., home to Aspen Mountain. Or, he proposed, even when they feel the vibration, "they think, 'I don't want to answer my phone right now -- I'm having a great time; my phone is killing my buzz."'
He noted that Aspen Mountain had recently posted signs at lift lines and ticket offices alerting Apple Watch and iPhone 14 users to the problem and encouraging them to upgrade to the latest software version or disable the service, to "prevent unnecessary trips to the slopes" by 911-dispatched ambulances.
At the Summit County call center on Sunday morning, Ms. Dummer was training a rookie dispatch supervisor, Jeff Fitch, to field 911 calls, while Mr. Betts and another dispatcher, David Benson, handled the overflow and communicated with ambulances and the police.
The siren went off, and Mr. Fitch picked up the call. "911," he said into his headset. "Hello?" A monitor displayed the caller's location on the ski slope; another displayed the caller's number. Mr. Fitch leaned forward into the silence: "Hello?"
The watch calls kept coming; the siren kept blaring. Amid it all, Ms. Dummer and Mr. Fitch fielded a genuine distress call from a 78-year-old driver who was having trouble breathing. Traffic was bad, hindering ambulance access, and the dispatch team was calling two nearby counties for help.
Just before noon, Mark Watson, a sergeant with the sheriff's office, walked into the dispatch room looking glum. "This is not a good day," he said.
Ordinarily, he had other duties, including patrolling the backcountry on snowmobile, but the ghost calls had kept him at his desk. Whenever the 911 operators were unable to reach the owner of the watch or phone, the case was referred to Sergeant Watson, who would try calling and sending a text; if he didn't hear back, he forwarded the issue to the ski patrol.
So far that day, Sergeant Watson had fielded seven referrals from 911, four of which he forwarded to the ski patrol. He turned to Ms. Dummer: How many crash-detection calls had come in overall? Eleven, she said, out of 30 calls total.
"I wanted to check the numbers," he said. "I was writing a letter to Apple." He described his basic message to the company: "I'm struggling to get my daily job done. I don't have all day to do Apple products."
In Grand County, home to a busy mountain called Winter Park, Sheriff Brett Schroetlin decided in late December to devote less attention to the crash-detection calls. Now if a 911 operator receives one from the slopes and no one is on the other end of the line, they know to ignore the call; no more referrals or follow-ups. None of the ghost calls so far have been real emergencies, Sheriff Schroetlin reasoned, and he couldn't afford to waste limited resources. Besides, he said, there was a better technology: human beings.
"It's rare that someone falls on the mountain and there's not a passer-by," he said. "We're hoping to get an actual 911 call from the person or someone on the scene."

Climate Start-Ups Entice Jaded Tech Workers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tech workers and investors are flocking to start-ups that aim to combat climate change.
When Arebeth Pease was laid off from the tech start-up MasterClass last year, she could have had her pick of jobs. But so many tech companies' missions rang hollow, she said, and many were creating more problems than they were fixing.
Ms. Pease, 42, was drawn instead to Span, a start-up that makes smart home electrical panels and is among a class of fast-growing companies aiming to combat climate change. She joined Span in September as an operations manager, with the start-up's focus on slowing the effects of climate change as the main selling point.
"We're actually doing work that matters," she said.
As tech companies slash perks and cut jobs, the downturn has spurred a wake-up call among many workers, causing them to question whether their company's role in society -- selling ads or selling stuff, often -- was actually making the world a better place. The result? More are now flocking to climate start-ups, just as investors pour money into the field.
Last year, climate start-ups in the United States raised nearly $ 20 billion, topping 2021's high of $ 18 billion and nearly tripling 2020's $ 7 billion, according to Crunchbase, a data provider. At least 83 climate-focused companies around the world are worth more than $ 1 billion, according to HolonIQ, a research firm.
Despite worries of a recession, enthusiasm about climate start-ups is undimmed. Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of the investment firm BlackRock, recently declared that 1,000 more $ 1 billion so-called climate unicorns were on the way.
"There is no line of business that will not be impacted by climate," said Chris Sacca, one of the founders of Lowercarbon Capital, a climate-focused venture capital firm, at a conference run by Axios in October. "That's also the opportunity."
The momentum and excitement, investors said, are different from the cleantech boom of the mid-2000s, when investors poured money into a cohort of clean energy companies that were reliant on government subsidies. Many of those start-ups eventually went under.
"There were a lot of lessons learned from the first cleantech wave," said Ben Marcus, an investor at the venture capital firm UP.Partners. "Investors are not just looking to invest in science projects but in real companies."
Now broader economic trends have coalesced to bolster the market. The cost of renewable energy has fallen over the last decade. The Securities and Exchange Commission last year proposed a rule that would require companies to report their emissions, creating demand for tools to measure them. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, dedicated $ 370 billion to climate-related spending.
Large corporations have also elevated climate-focused initiatives to the boardroom, with 91 percent of the global economy now covered by "net zero" pledges of some sort, according to Net Zero Tracker, a nonprofit site.
Climate tech is "one of the few bright spots in the economy and one of the few industries that tend to be extremely recession-resilient," said Rick Zullo, an investor at the venture capital firm Equal Ventures.
At least 135 funds focused on climate investing, with $ 94 billion under management, have been created since 2021, according to the newsletter Climate Tech VC. The largest tech investment firms -- including Sequoia Capital, Khosla Ventures, General Atlantic and TPG -- have increased their investments in climate-tech companies, as have corporate investors like Salesforce and United Airlines.
Lila Preston, an investor at Generation Investment Management, the investment firm that Al Gore helped found in 2004, said the momentum was welcome and "absolutely needed."
"You want the very best investors around the table with you when you are disrupting industries," she said.
Still, with Silicon Valley-style growth comes Silicon Valley-style hype. Many in the industry are wary of the risks of too much money flowing into climate start-ups at inflated valuations. Some fear that the excitement will lead to more "greenwashing" -- when businesses make "green" marketing a priority over actual impact -- and infighting over which solution is best, ultimately damaging the industry's credibility.
But the stakes are too high to be cynical, climate entrepreneurs and investors said.
"There's a bigger fight to fight," said Elisa Jagerson, an investor at Wildcat Venture Partners. "Everything else feels like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic."
It wasn't always that way. When Julia Collins pitched investors on her climate tech start-up in 2019, she dedicated the first slide of her presentation to a dramatic explanation of the climate emergency. She had created Planet FWD, a software provider that helps businesses manage their climate impact, and Moonshot, a snack food company that uses regenerative ingredients, local suppliers and recycled packaging.
"I had to spend a lot of time on the pitches bringing people up the learning curve," she said.
That has since changed as climate change and extreme weather events became impossible to escape. "We're well beyond the point of having to prove climate change, or that it's a big market," said Ms. Collins, who no longer uses the dramatic slide in her pitches.
Some of the new climate start-ups are already increasing in value, at least on paper, fueled by the floods of cash. Josh Felser, an investor at Climactic, a venture capital firm, said the 11 climate companies that he and a partner had backed over the last two years were now worth two and a half times what they had been at the time of investment because other investors had put more money in at higher valuations.
"It's not because we're that good," he said. "It's because the market is so hot."
Founders said business was booming because potential customers faced more outside pressure to become environmentally friendly, pushing them to spend money on things like emissions trackers and carbon offsets. Infogrid, a start-up that provides tools to make buildings operate and use energy more efficiently, previously had a hard time selling its products to customers, said William Cowell de Gruchy, the company's chief executive.
"Now they're like: 'We've got to do this. Our shareholders are making us. Our boardroom is making us. Regulators are making us,"' he said.
Many tech workers have gone through a similar climate awakening. Olya Irzak, one of the founders of Frost Methane Labs, which helps reduce methane seeps from coal mines and other natural sources, has mentored people who want to work at climate companies for almost a decade. But during the pandemic, more people began reaching out to her and taking an interest in her annual list of climate start-ups, she said.
"People were sitting at home a lot, asking a lot of hard questions," Ms. Irzak said. "That was when the tech talent pool started shifting really dramatically."
One effort, Climate Draft, aims to help climate start-ups find advisers, investors and employees from the tech industry. More than 3,000 recently laid-off tech workers have signed up to learn about jobs at climate companies, the company said. Another online community, Work on Climate, has ballooned to 16,000 members since it began in 2020. People use it to network and learn about jobs.

SAN FRANCISCO — When Arebeth Pease was laid off from the tech startup MasterClass last year, she could have had her pick of jobs. But so many tech companies’ missions rang hollow, she said, and many were creating more problems than they were fixing.
Pease, 42, was drawn instead to Span, a startup that makes smart home electrical panels and is among a class of fast-growing companies aiming to combat climate change. She joined Span in September as an operations manager, with the startup’s focus on slowing the effects of climate change as the main selling point.
“We’re actually doing work that matters,” she said.
As tech companies slash perks and cut jobs, the downturn has spurred a wake-up call among many workers, causing them to question whether their company’s role in society — selling ads or selling stuff, often — was actually making the world a better place. The result? More are now flocking to climate startups, just as investors pour money into the field.
Last year, climate startups in the United States raised nearly $20 billion, topping 2021’s high of $18 billion and nearly tripling 2020’s $7 billion, according to Crunchbase, a data provider. At least 83 climate-focused companies around the world are worth more than $1 billion, according to HolonIQ, a research firm.
Despite worries of a recession, enthusiasm about climate startups is undimmed. Laurence D. Fink, CEO of the investment firm BlackRock, recently declared that 1,000 more $1 billion so-called climate unicorns were on the way.
“There is no line of business that will not be impacted by climate,” said Chris Sacca, one of the founders of Lowercarbon Capital, a climate-focused venture capital firm, at a conference run by Axios in October. “That’s also the opportunity.”
The momentum and excitement, investors said, are different from the cleantech boom of the mid-2000s, when investors poured money into a cohort of clean energy companies that were reliant on government subsidies. Many of those startups eventually went under.
“There were a lot of lessons learned from the first cleantech wave,” said Ben Marcus, an investor at the venture capital firm UP.Partners. “Investors are not just looking to invest in science projects but in real companies.”
Now broader economic trends have coalesced to bolster the market. The cost of renewable energy has fallen over the past decade. The Securities and Exchange Commission last year proposed a rule that would require companies to report their emissions, creating demand for tools to measure them. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, dedicated $370 billion to climate-related spending.
Large corporations have also elevated climate-focused initiatives to the boardroom, with 91% of the global economy now covered by “net zero” pledges of some sort, according to Net Zero Tracker, a nonprofit site.
Climate tech is “one of the few bright spots in the economy and one of the few industries that tend to be extremely recession-resilient,” said Rick Zullo, an investor at the venture capital firm Equal Ventures.
At least 135 funds focused on climate investing, with $94 billion under management, have been created since 2021, according to the newsletter Climate Tech VC. The largest tech investment firms — including Sequoia Capital, Khosla Ventures, General Atlantic and TPG — have increased their investments in climate-tech companies, as have corporate investors such as Salesforce and United Airlines.
Lila Preston, an investor at Generation Investment Management, the investment firm that Al Gore helped found in 2004, said the momentum was welcome and “absolutely needed.”
“You want the very best investors around the table with you when you are disrupting industries,” she said.
Still, with Silicon Valley-style growth comes Silicon Valley-style hype. Many in the industry are wary of the risks of too much money flowing into climate startups at inflated valuations. Some fear that the excitement will lead to more “greenwashing” — when businesses make “green” marketing a priority over actual impact — and infighting over which solution is best, ultimately damaging the industry’s credibility.
But the stakes are too high to be cynical, climate entrepreneurs and investors said.
“There’s a bigger fight to fight,” said Elisa Jagerson, an investor at Wildcat Venture Partners. “Everything else feels like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.”
It wasn’t always that way. When Julia Collins pitched investors on her climate tech startup in 2019, she dedicated the first slide of her presentation to a dramatic explanation of the climate emergency. She had created Planet FWD, a software provider that helps businesses manage their climate impact, and Moonshot, a snack food company that uses regenerative ingredients, local suppliers and recycled packaging.
“I had to spend a lot of time on the pitches bringing people up the learning curve,” she said.
That has since changed as climate change and extreme weather events became impossible to escape. “We’re well beyond the point of having to prove climate change, or that it’s a big market,” said Collins, who no longer uses the dramatic slide in her pitches.
Some of the new climate startups are already increasing in value, at least on paper, fueled by the floods of cash. Josh Felser, an investor at Climactic, a venture capital firm, said the 11 climate companies that he and a partner had backed over the past two years were now worth 2 1/2 times what they had been at the time of investment because other investors had put more money in at higher valuations.
“It’s not because we’re that good,” he said. “It’s because the market is so hot.”
Founders said business was booming because potential customers faced more outside pressure to become environmentally friendly, pushing them to spend money on things like emissions trackers and carbon offsets. Infogrid, a startup that provides tools to make buildings operate and use energy more efficiently, previously had a hard time selling its products to customers, said William Cowell de Gruchy, the company’s CEO.
“Now they’re like: ‘We’ve got to do this. Our shareholders are making us. Our boardroom is making us. Regulators are making us,’” he said.
Many tech workers have gone through a similar climate awakening. Olya Irzak, one of the founders of Frost Methane Labs, which helps reduce methane seeps from coal mines and other natural sources, has mentored people who want to work at climate companies for almost a decade. But during the pandemic, more people began reaching out to her and taking an interest in her annual list of climate startups, she said.
“People were sitting at home a lot, asking a lot of hard questions,” Irzak said. “That was when the tech talent pool started shifting really dramatically.”
One effort, Climate Draft, aims to help climate startups find advisers, investors and employees from the tech industry. More than 3,000 recently laid-off tech workers have signed up to learn about jobs at climate companies, the company said. Another online community, Work on Climate, has ballooned to 16,000 members since it began in 2020. People use it to network and learn about jobs.
“Rebuilding every single industry we have is going to require the participation of everybody who is in the workforce,” said Eugene Kirpichov, a former engineer at Google who helped found Work on Climate.

Across Tech, Easy Money Yields to Hard Times: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Eighteen months ago, the online used car retailer Carvana had such great prospects that it was worth $ 80 billion. Now it is valued at less than $ 1.5 billion, a 98 percent plunge, and is struggling to survive.
Many other tech companies are also seeing their fortunes reverse and their dreams dim. They are shedding employees, cutting back, watching their financial valuations shrivel -- even as the larger economy chugs along with a low unemployment rate and a 3.2 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter.
One largely unacknowledged explanation: An unprecedented era of rock-bottom interest rates has abruptly ended. Money is no longer virtually free.
For over a decade, investors desperate for returns sent their money to Silicon Valley, which pumped it into a wide range of start-ups that might not have received a nod in less heady times. Extreme valuations made it easy to issue stock or take on loans to expand aggressively or to offer sweet deals to potential customers that quickly boosted market share.
It was a boom that seemed as if it would never end. Tech piled up victories, and its competitors wilted. Carvana built dozens of flashy car "vending machines" across the country, marketed itself relentlessly and offered very attractive prices for trade-ins.
"The whole tech industry of the last 15 years was built by cheap money," said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst with Guidehouse Insights. "Now they're getting hit by a new reality, and they will pay the price."
Cheap money funded many of the acquisitions that substitute for organic growth in tech. Two years ago, as the pandemic raged and many office workers were confined to their homes, Salesforce bought the office communications tool Slack for $ 28 billion, a sum that some analysts thought was too high. Salesforce borrowed $ 10 billion to do the deal. This month, it said it was cutting 8,000 people, about 10 percent of its staff, many of them at Slack.
Even the biggest tech companies are affected. Amazon was willing to lose money for years to acquire new customers. It is taking a different approach these days, laying off 18,000 office workers and shuttering operations that are not financially viable.
Carvana, like many start-ups, pulled a page out of Amazon's old playbook, trying to get big fast. Used cars, it believed, were a highly fragmented market ripe for reinvention, just the way taxis, bookstores and hotels had been. It strove to outdistance any competition.
The company, based in Tempe, Ariz., wanted to replace traditional dealers with, Carvana said grandly, "technology and exceptional customer service." In what seemed to symbolize the death of the old way of doing things, it paid $ 22 million for a six-acre site in San Diego that a Mazda dealer had occupied since 1965.
Where traditional dealerships were literally flat, Carvana built multistory car vending machines that became memorable local landmarks. Customers picked up their cars at these towers, which now total 33. A corporate video of the building of one vending machine has over four million views on YouTube.
In the third quarter of 2021, Carvana delivered 110,000 cars to customers, up 74 percent from 2020. The goal: two million cars a year, which would make it by far the largest used car retailer.
Then, even more quickly than the company grew, it fell apart. When used car sales rose more than 25 percent in the first year of the pandemic, that created a supply problem: Carvana needed many more vehicles. It acquired a car auction company for $ 2.2 billion and took on even more debt at a premium interest rate. And it paid customers handsomely for cars.
But as the pandemic waned and interest rates began to rise, sales slowed. Carvana, which declined to comment for this article, did a round of layoffs in May and another in November. Its chief executive, Ernie Garcia, blamed the higher cost of financing, saying, "We failed to accurately predict how all this will play out."
Some competitors are even worse off. Vroom, a Houston company, has seen its stock fall to $ 1 from $ 65 in mid-2020. Over the past year, it has dismissed half of its employees.
"High rates are painful for almost everyone, but they are particularly painful for Silicon Valley," said Kairong Xiao, an associate professor of finance at Columbia Business School. "I expect more layoffs and investment cuts unless the Fed reverses its tightening."
At the moment, there is little likelihood of that. The market expects two more rate increases by the Federal Reserve this year, to at least 5 percent.
In real estate, that is trouble for anyone expecting a quick recovery. Low rates not only pushed up house prices but also made it irresistible for companies such as Zillow as well as Redfin, Opendoor Technologies and others, to get into a business that used to be considered slightly disreputable: flipping houses.
In 2019, Zillow estimated it would soon have revenue of $ 20 billion from selling 5,000 houses a month. That thrilled investors, who pushed the publicly traded Seattle company to a $ 45 billion valuation and created a hiring boom that raised the number of employees to 8,000.
Zillow's notion was to use artificial intelligence software to make a chaotic real estate market more efficient, predictable and profitable. This was the sort of innovation that the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen talked about in 2011 when he said digital insurgents would take over entire industries. "Software is eating the world," he wrote.
In June 2021, Zillow owned 50 homes in California's capital, Sacramento. Five months later, it had 400. One was an unremarkable four-bedroom, three-bath house in the northwest corner of the city. Built in 2001, it is convenient to several parks and the airport. Zillow paid $ 700,000 for it.
Zillow put the house on the market for months, but no one wanted it, even at $ 625,000. Last fall, after it had unceremoniously exited the flipping market, Zillow unloaded the house for $ 355,000. Low rates had made it seem possible that Zillow could shoot for the moon, but even they could not make it a success.
Ryan Lundquist, a Sacramento appraiser who followed the house's history closely on his blog, said Zillow realized real estate was fragmented but perhaps did not quite appreciate that houses were labor-intensive, deeply personal, one-to-one transactions.
"This idea of being able to come in and change the game completely -- that's really difficult to do, and most of the time you don't," he said.
Zillow's market value has now shrunk to $ 10 billion, and its employee count to around 5,500 after two rounds of layoffs. It declined to comment.
The dream of market domination through software dies hard, however. Zillow recently made a deal with Opendoor, an online real estate company in San Francisco that buys and sells residential properties and has also been ravaged by the downturn. Under the agreement, sellers on Zillow's platform can request to have Opendoor make offers on their homes. Zillow said sellers would "save themselves the stress and uncertainty of a traditional sale process."
That partnership might explain why the buyer of that four-bedroom Sacramento house, one of the last in Zillow's portfolio, was none other than Opendoor. It made some modest improvements and put the house on the market for $ 632,000, nearly twice what it had paid. A deal is pending.
"If it were really this easy, everyone would be a flipper," Mr. Lundquist said.
The easy money era had been well established when Amazon decided it had mastered e-commerce enough to take on the physical world. Its plans to expand into bookstores was a rumor for years and finally happened in 2015. The media went wild. According to one well-circulated story, the retailer planned to open as many as 400 bookstores.
The company's idea was that the stores would function as extensions of its online operation. Reader reviews would guide the potential buyer. Titles were displayed face out, so there were only 6,000 of them. The stores were showrooms for Amazon's electronics.
Being a showroom for the internet is expensive. Amazon had to hire booksellers and lease storefronts in popular areas. And letting enthusiastic reviews be one of the selection criteria meant stocking self-published titles, some of which were pumped up with reviews by the authors' friends. These were not books that readers wanted.
Amazon likes to try new things, and that costs money. It took on another $ 10 billion of long-term debt in the first nine months of the year at a higher rate of interest than it was paying two years ago. This month, it said it was borrowing $ 8 billion more. Its stock market valuation has shrunk by about a trillion dollars.
The retailer closed 68 stores last March, including not only bookstores but also pop-ups and so-called four-star stores. It continues to operate its Whole Foods grocery subsidiary, which has 500 U.S. locations, and other food stores. Amazon said in a statement that it was "committed to building great, long-term physical retail experiences and technologies."
Traditional book selling, where expectations are modest, may have an easier path now. Barnes & Noble, the bricks-and-mortar chain recently deemed all but dead, has moved into two former Amazon locations in Massachusetts, putting about 20,000 titles into each. The chain said the stores were doing "very well." It is scouting other former Amazon locations.
"Amazon did a very different bookstore than we're doing," said Janine Flanigan, Barnes & Noble's director of store planning and design. "Our focus is books."

Shall I Compare Thee to a Chabot's Algorithm?: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Franz Broseph seemed like any other Diplomacy player to Claes de Graaff. The handle was a joke -- the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I reborn as an online bro -- but that was the kind of humor that people who play Diplomacy tend to enjoy. The game is a classic, beloved by the likes of John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger, combining military strategy with political intrigue as it recreates the First World War: Players negotiate with allies, enemies and everyone in between as they plan how their armies will move across 20th-century Europe.
When Franz Broseph joined a 20-player online tournament at the end of August, he wooed other players, lying to them and ultimately betraying them. He finished in first place.
Mr. de Graaff, a chemist living in the Netherlands, finished fifth. He had spent nearly 10 years playing Diplomacy, both online and at face-to-face tournaments across the globe. He did not realize until it was revealed several weeks later that he had lost to a machine. Franz Broseph was a bot.
"I was flabbergasted," Mr. de Graaff, 36, said. "It seemed so genuine -- so lifelike. It could read my texts and converse with me and make plans that were mutually beneficial -- that would allow both of us to get ahead. It also lied to me and betrayed me, like top players frequently do."
Built by a team of artificial intelligence researchers from the tech giant Meta, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other prominent universities, Franz Broseph is among the new wave of online chatbots that are rapidly moving machines into new territory.
When you chat with these bots, it can feel like chatting with another person. It can feel, in other words, like machines have passed a test that was supposed to prove their intelligence.
For more than 70 years, computer scientists have struggled to build technology that could pass the Turing test: the technological inflection point where we humans are no longer sure whether we are chatting with a machine or a person. The test is named for Alan Turing, the famed British mathematician, philosopher and wartime code breaker who proposed the test back in 1950. He believed it could show the world when machines had finally reached true intelligence.
The Turing test is a subjective measure. It depends on whether the people asking the questions feel convinced that they are talking to another person when in fact they are talking to a device.
But whoever is asking the questions, machines will soon leave this test in the rearview mirror.
Bots like Franz Broseph have already passed the test in particular situations, like negotiating Diplomacy moves or calling a restaurant for dinner reservations. ChatGPT, a bot released in November by OpenAI, a San Francisco lab, leaves people feeling as if they were chatting with another person, not a bot. The lab said more than a million people had used it. Because ChatGPT can write just about anything, including term papers, universities are worried it will make a mockery of class work. When some people talk to these bots, they even describe them as sentient or conscious, believing that machines have somehow developed an awareness of the world around them.
Privately, OpenAI has built a system, GPT-4, that is even more powerful than ChatGPT. It may even generate images as well as words.
And yet these bots are not sentient. They are not conscious. They are not intelligent -- at least not in the way that humans are intelligent. Even people building the technology acknowledge this point.
These bots are pretty good at certain kinds of conversation, but they cannot respond to the unexpected as well as most humans can. They sometimes spew nonsense and cannot correct their own mistakes. Although they can match or even exceed human performance in some ways, they cannot in others. Like similar systems that came before, they tend to complement skilled workers rather than replace them.
Part of the problem is that when a bot mimics conversation, it can seem smarter than it really is. When we see a flash of humanlike behavior in a pet or a machine, we tend to assume it behaves like us in other ways, too -- even when it does not. The Turing test does not consider that we humans are gullible by nature, that words can so easily mislead us into believing something that is not true.
"These systems can do a lot of useful things," said Ilya Sutskever, chief scientist at OpenAI and one of the most important A.I. researchers of the past decade, referring to the new wave of chatbots. "On the other hand, they are not there yet. People think they can do things they cannot."
As the latest technologies emerge from research labs, it is now obvious -- if it was not obvious before -- that scientists must rethink and reshape how they track the progress of artificial intelligence. The Turing test is not up to the task.
Time and time again, A.I. technologies have surpassed supposedly insurmountable tests, including mastery of chess (1997), "Jeopardy!" (2011), Go (2016) and poker (2019). Now it is surpassing another, and again this does not necessarily mean what we thought it would.
We -- the public -- need a new framework for understanding what A.I. can do, what it cannot, what it will do in the future and how it will change our lives, for better or for worse.
The Imitation Game
In 1950, Alan Turing published a paper called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence." Fifteen years after his ideas helped spawn the world's first computers, he proposed a way of determining whether these new machines could think. At the time, the scientific world was struggling to understand what a computer was. Was it a digital brain? Or was it something else? Turing offered a way of answering this question.
He called it the "imitation game."
It involved two lengthy conversations -- one with a machine and another with a human being. Both conversations would be conducted via text chat, so that the person on the other end would not immediately know which one he or she was talking to. If the person could not tell the difference between the two as the conversations progressed, then you could rightly say the machine could think.
"The question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include," Turing wrote. The test could include everything from poetry to mathematics, he explained, laying out a hypothetical conversation:
Q: Please write me a sonnet on the subject of the Forth Bridge.
A: Count me out on this one. I never could write poetry.
Q: Add 34957 to 70764.
A: (Pause about 30 seconds and then give as answer) 105621.
Q: Do you play chess?
A: Yes.
Q: I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?
A: (After a pause of 15 seconds) R-R8 mate.
When Turing proposed the test, computers could not chat. Scientists communicated with these room-size machines by feeding mathematical and textual instructions into vacuum tubes via typewriters, magnetic tape and punched cards. But as the years passed and researchers created a new field they called artificial intelligence -- a concerted effort to build machines that could think at the level of a human -- many held up the imitation game as the ultimate goal.
"People were not building systems for fluent dialogue. That was just too hard," said Stuart Shieber, a Harvard computer scientist who specializes in computational linguistics, including the Turing test. "But it was an aspiration."
By the mid-1960s, machines could chat in small ways. And even then, they fooled people into believing they were more intelligent than they really were.
A researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Joseph Weizenbaum, built an automated psychotherapist called Eliza, which did little more than repeat what a user said in the form of a question. But some treated this bot as if it were a human therapist, unloading their most personal secrets and feelings.
Over the next several decades, chatbots improved at a snail's pace. The best that researchers could do was lay down a long list of rules defining how a bot should behave. And no matter how many rules they wrote, they were never enough. The scope of natural language was just too big.
In 2014, after nearly 60 years of A.I. research, three researchers in St. Petersburg, Russia, built a bot, called Eugene Goostman, that imitated a 13-year-old Ukrainian who had learned English as a second language. But claims from its creators -- and from the news media -- that it had passed the Turing test were greatly exaggerated.
When asked, "Which is bigger, a shoe box or Mount Everest?," this bot said: "I can't make a choice right now." When asked, "How many legs does a camel have?," it replied: "Something between 2 and 4. Maybe, three? :-)))"
Then, about three years later, researchers at places like Google and OpenAI began building a new kind of artificial intelligence.
Write me a sonnet
On a recent morning, I asked ChatGPT the same questions that Turing had laid out in his 1950 paper. It instantly generated a poem about the Forth Bridge:
Its red paint gleams in the morning sun
A sight to behold, for all to see
Its majesty and grandeur never done
Then it correctly added 34,957 and 70,764. It did not need 30 seconds to do so. When I laid out the end of a chess game as Turing did, it responded with typically clear, concise, confident prose. It seemed to understand the situation.
But it did not. It mistook the end of the game for the beginning. "I would move my rook to R2," it said. "It is generally a good idea to try to develop your pieces (move them out from their starting positions) as quickly as possible in chess."
ChatGPT is what researchers call a neural network, a mathematical system loosely modeled on the network of neurons in the brain. This is the same technology that translates between English and Spanish on services like Google Translate and identifies pedestrians as self-driving cars weave through city streets.
A neural network learns skills by analyzing data. By pinpointing patterns in thousands of photos of stop signs, for example, it can learn to recognize a stop sign.
Five years ago, Google, OpenAI and other A.I. labs started designing neural networks that analyzed enormous amounts of digital text, including books, news stories, Wikipedia articles and online chat logs. Researchers call them "large language models." Pinpointing billions of distinct patterns in the way people connect words, letters and symbols, these systems learned to generate their own text.
They can create tweets, blog posts, poems, even computer programs. They can carry on a conversation -- at least up to a point. And as they do, they can seamlessly combine far-flung concepts. You can ask them to rewrite Queen's pop operetta, "Bohemian Rhapsody," so that it rhapsodizes about the life of a postdoc academic researcher, and they will.
"They can extrapolate," said Oriol Vinyals, senior director of deep learning research at the London lab DeepMind, who has built groundbreaking systems that can juggle everything from language to three-dimensional video games. "They can combine concepts in ways you would never anticipate."
Researchers, businesses and other early adopters have been testing these systems for years. Initially, they were difficult to use. And they spat out as much nonsense as coherent language. But with ChatGPT, OpenAI has refined the technology.
As people tested an early version of the system, OpenAI asked them to rate its responses, specifying whether they were convincing or truthful or useful. Then, through a technique called reinforcement learning, the lab used these ratings to hone the system and more carefully define what it would and would not do.
The result is a chatbot geared toward answering individual questions -- the very thing that Turing envisioned. Google, Meta and other organizations have built bots that operate in similar ways.
The trouble is that while their language skills are shockingly impressive, the words and ideas are not always backed by what most people would call reason or common sense. The systems write recipes with no regard for how the food will taste. They make little distinction between fact and fiction. They suggest chess moves with complete confidence even when they do not understand the state of the game.
Because they are trained on data from across the internet, there are an infinite number of situations where they seem to get things right while actually getting them very wrong.
Dr. Sutskever of OpenAI compares these bots to the automated driving service that Tesla calls Full Self Driving. This experimental technology can drive itself on city streets. But you -- the human driver -- are required to keep your eyes on the road and take control of the car at any moment.
"It does everything. It turns and it stops and it sees all the pedestrians," he said. "And yet you have to intervene fairly frequently."
ChatGPT does question-and-answer, but it tends to break down when you take it in other directions. Franz Broseph can negotiate Diplomacy moves for a few minutes, but if each round of negotiations had been a little longer, Mr. De Graaff might well have realized it was a bot. And if Franz Broseph were dropped into any other situation -- like answering tech support calls -- it would be useless.
A New Test
Six months before releasing its chatbot, OpenAI unveiled a tool called DALL-E.
A nod to both "WALL-E," the 2008 animated movie about an autonomous robot, and Salvador Dalí, the Surrealist painter, this experimental technology lets you create digital images simply by describing what you want to see. This is also a neural network, built much like Franz Broseph or ChatGPT. The difference is that it learned from both images and text. Analyzing millions of digital images and the captions that described them, it learned to recognize the links between pictures and words.
This is what's known as a multimodal system. Google, OpenAI and other organizations are already using similar methods to build systems that can generate video of people and objects. Start-ups are building bots that can navigate software apps and websites on a user's behalf.
These are not systems that anyone can properly evaluate with the Turing test -- or any other simple method. Their end goal is not conversation.
Researchers at Google and DeepMind, which is owned by Google's parent company, are developing tests meant to evaluate chatbots and systems like DALL-E, to judge what they do well, where they lack reason and common sense, and more. One test shows videos to artificial intelligence systems and asks them to explain what has happened. After watching someone tinker with an electric shaver, for instance, the A.I. must explain why the shaver did not turn on.
These tests feel like academic exercises -- much like the Turing test. We need something that is more practical, that can really tell us what these systems do well and what they cannot, how they will replace human labor in the near term and how they will not.
We could also use a change in attitude. "We need a paradigm shift -- where we no longer judge intelligence by comparing machines to human behavior," said Oren Etzioni, professor emeritus at the University of Washington and founding chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI, a prominent lab in Seattle.
Turing's test judged whether a machine could imitate a human. This is how artificial intelligence is typically portrayed -- as the rise of machines that think like people. But the technologies under development today are very different from you and me. They cannot deal with concepts they have never seen before. And they cannot take ideas and explore them in the physical world.
ChatGPT made that clear. As more users experimented with it, they showed off its abilities and limitations. One Twitter user asked ChatGPT what letter came next in the sequence O T T F F S S, and it gave the correct answer (E). But it also told him the wrong reason it was correct, failing to realize that these are the first letters in the numbers 1 to 8.
At the same time, there are many ways these bots are superior to you and me. They do not get tired. They do not let emotion cloud what they are trying to do. They can instantly draw on far larger amounts of information. And they can generate text, images and other media at speeds and volumes we humans never could.
Their skills will also improve considerably in the coming years.
Researchers can rapidly hone these systems by feeding them more and more data. The most advanced systems, like ChatGPT, require months of training, but over those months, they can develop skills they did not exhibit in the past.
"We have found a set of techniques that scale effortlessly," said Raia Hadsell, senior director of research and robotics at DeepMind. "We have a simple, powerful approach that continues to get better and better."
The exponential improvement we have seen in these chatbots over the past few years will not last forever. The gains may soon level out. But even then, multimodal systems will continue to improve -- and master increasingly complex skills involving images, sounds and computer code. And computer scientists will combine these bots with systems that can do things they cannot. ChatGPT failed Turing's chess test. But we knew in 1997 that a computer could beat the best humans at chess. Plug ChatGPT into a chess program, and the hole is filled.
In the months and years to come, these bots will help you find information on the internet. They will explain concepts in ways you can understand. If you like, they will even write your tweets, blog posts and term papers.
They will tabulate your monthly expenses in your spreadsheets. They will visit real estate websites and find houses in your price range. They will produce online avatars that look and sound like humans. They will make mini-movies, complete with music and dialogue.
"This will be the next step up from Pixar -- superpersonalized movies that anyone can create really quickly," said Bryan McCann, former lead research scientist at Salesforce, who is exploring chatbots and other A.I. technologies at a start-up called You.com.
As ChatGPT and DALL-E have shown, this kind of thing will be shocking, fascinating and fun. It will also leave us wondering how it will change our lives. What happens to people who have spent their careers making movies? Will this technology flood the internet with images that seem real but are not? Will their mistakes lead us astray?
"All the President's Men," Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward's classic tale of uncovering Watergate, tells a story about a history paper that Mr. Woodward wrote as a freshman at Yale. After reading countless documents that described King Henry IV standing barefoot in the snow for days as he waited to beg forgiveness from Pope Gregory in 1077, Mr. Woodward included the anecdote in his paper. His professor gave the paper a failing grade, explaining that no human being could stand barefoot in the snow for so long without his feet freezing off.
"The divine right of kings did not extend to overturning the laws of nature and common sense," the professor said.
Drawing from endless documents about King Henry's visit to Canossa, ChatGPT might well make the same mistake. You must play the professor.
Certainly, these bots will change the world. But the onus is on you to be wary of what these systems say and do, to edit what they give you, to approach everything you see online with skepticism. Researchers know how to give these systems a wide range of skills, but they do not yet know how to give them reason or common sense or a sense of truth.
That still lies with you.

The Era of Happy Tech Workers Is Over: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Silicon Valley as we know it -- with its radically transparent company cultures, empowered employees, flat hierarchies and rarefied perks like nap pods and free food -- is quickly disappearing. And it's unlikely to return.
For nearly two decades, tech companies heralded an approach that centered on making workers happy with benefits that were intended to seamlessly integrate work and life. They made well-being programs and unlimited vacation, initiatives that prioritized the whole person, standard employee benefits. This, along with high salaries and equity packages, was a way not just to win but also to dominate the war for talent. The rapid growth and success of Silicon Valley companies, driven in part by their unique people practices, reimagined workplace culture for a generation.
Times, as they say, are a-changin'. The industry is facing an uneven macroeconomic environment and a roiling stock market that is putting pressure on public tech companies and making for a less-than-ideal I.P.O. environment for private ones. Tech chief executives are now optimizing more for profitability than for growth at all costs, sometimes at the expense of long-held organizational beliefs.
The shift is most evident in the recent surge of tech layoffs. There has been lots of public discussion about the disruptive axing of half of Twitter's 7,500 employees, a move conducted under its new owner, Elon Musk. Haphazard and rolling, the layoffs were painful to watch. The employees who remained have had to endure greater workloads on significantly smaller teams. But while outsiders may have viewed these layoffs as impulsive, they seemed to have primed the environment for other tech companies to follow. In 2022, the tech industry laid off over 150,000 people. In the first few weeks of 2023, Microsoft announced 10,000 job cuts and Alphabet followed with 12,000.
According to multiple media outlets, Meta and Amazon use stack ranking for their employees, a controversial approach in evaluating talent. Popularized by G.E. in the 1980s (though the company later abandoned it), the process has managers rate their employees on a forced curve. Generally, only 20 percent are deemed top talent, and 10 to 15 percent must be designated as low performers. Although there are benefits, even in the best of times, the practice can create a competitive work environment that de-emphasizes employee improvement. With impending layoffs, people with the lowest ranking are typically the first to go.
The layoffs are part of a new age of bossism, the notion that management has given up too much control and must wrest it back from employees. After two decades of fighting for talent, chief executives are using this period to adjust for years of management indulgence that left them with a generation of entitled workers.
In 2012, to spur innovation and drive engagement, LinkedIn began the incubator program. A perk that encouraged employees to come up with approved ideas that they could work on full time for up to three months was generous even by Silicon Valley standards. Then there were the many lavish events that served to put a company's culture on display. It was par for the course for employees to attend elaborately themed holiday parties featuring the next new Instagrammable experience. If you happened to work at Uber in 2015 and attended its corporate event in Las Vegas, you were treated to a private performance from Beyoncé.
Executives across industries are leaning into their newfound bossism and ending pandemic-era work arrangements and incentives. Reed Hastings, Netflix's co-founder and co-C.E.O., said near the start of the pandemic that he didn't "see any positives" in working from home, and the company apparently allows only some remote work. TikTok reportedly told employees that it was sunsetting gym membership and Wi-Fi reimbursements as well as its $ 45 daily meal stipends to workers not tied to the company's main hubs, in its own efforts at restraint. These changes are bellwethers.
Not all tech employees see these shifts as signals. I recently spoke with a product marketing manager from Meta who was laid off. I assumed that she would be apprehensive about her job prospects; instead, armed with three months' severance and decent savings, she remains optimistic. With nearly 79 percent of software engineers and nearly 76 percent of marketers who were laid off in tech finding jobs within three months, her optimism isn't necessarily unfounded.
However, a few things are true now that make the shift in tech employee culture not just a moment in time but also a redefinition of how tech companies will be run.
Meta and Salesforce combined lost more than $ 700 billion in market cap last year. Both companies are now dealing with activist investors who have taken prominent positions in their stocks. The activists have called for the companies to slash costs, reduce nonstrategic investments and, notably in Meta's case, aggressively reduce its work force. Managers have less capacity to overhire and invest in employee initiatives that aren't tied directly to business execution.
For tech start-ups and founder-C.E.O.s, the past 10 years were a bull run. Interest rates were low, venture funding seemed limitless and valuations skyrocketed. With money being essentially free, founder-C.E.O.s dived in -- pursuing revenue, increasing their customer bases and investing in myriad people and projects.
However, with recent interest rates the highest they have been since late 2007 and continuing market uncertainty, investors are considering more investments in companies with strong fundamentals and cash flows. For founder-C.E.O.s, this means it will be harder to raise funding, and investors will have an even greater expectation of return on their money. For large tech companies and start-ups alike, cash is no longer free, and employee investments must pay off.
We are entering an era of external investor pressure, higher financing hurdles and overall market volatility. This environment calls for management to make structural changes in the way workplace culture is experienced for both labor and capital.
The current tech work force is used to every voice getting a vote, and it will now have to yield to a new world -- one with heightened expectations and disciplined investment. Not considering the winds of change will put the careers of many empowered workers at risk.

Layoffs in Tech Reveal a Divide Of Generations: [National Desk]

Full text: The industry's recent job cuts have been an awakening for a generation of workers who have never experienced a cyclical crash.
When Lyft laid off 13 percent of its workers in November, Kelly Chang was shocked to find herself among the 700 people who lost their jobs at the San Francisco company.
"It seemed like tech companies had so much opportunity," said Ms. Chang, 26. "If you got a job, you made it. It was a sustainable path."
Brian Pulliam, on the other hand, brushed off the news that the crypto exchange Coinbase was eliminating his job. Ever since the 48-year-old engineer was laid off from his first job at the video game company Atari in 2003, he said, he has asked himself once a year: "If I were laid off, what would I do?"
The contrast between Ms. Chang's and Mr. Pulliam's reactions to their professional letdowns speaks to a generational divide that is becoming more clear as the tech industry, which expanded rapidly through the pandemic, swings toward mass layoffs.
Microsoft said this week that it planned to cut 10,000 jobs, or roughly 5 percent of its work force. And on Friday morning, Google's parent company, Alphabet, said it planned to cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its total. Their cuts followed big layoffs at other tech companies like Meta, Amazon and Salesforce.
Millennials and Generation Z, born between 1981 and 2012, started tech careers during a decade-long expansion when jobs multiplied as fast as iPhone sales. The companies they joined were conquering the world and defying economic rules. And when they went to work at outfits that offered bus rides to the office and amenities like free food and laundry, they weren't just taking on a new job -- they were taking on a lifestyle. Few of them had experienced widespread layoffs.
Baby boomers and members of Generation X, born between 1946 and 1980, on the other hand, lived through the biggest contraction the industry has ever seen. The dot-com crash of the early 2000s eliminated more than one million jobs, emptying Silicon Valley's Highway 101 of commuters as many companies folded overnight.
"It was a blood bath, and it went on for years," said Jason DeMorrow, a software engineer who was laid off twice in 18 months and was out of work for more than six months. "As concerning as the current downturn is, and as much as I empathize with the people impacted, there's no comparison."
Tech's generational divide is representative of a broader phenomenon. The year someone is born has a big influence on views about work and money. Early personal experiences strongly determine a person's appetite for financial risk, according to a 2011 study by the economists Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California, Berkeley, and Stefan Nagel of the University of Chicago.
The study, which analyzed the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances from 1960 to 2007, found that people who came of age in the 1970s, when the stock market stagnated, were reluctant to invest in the early 1980s, when it roared. That trend reversed in the 1990s.
"Once you experience your first crash, things change," Professor Nagel said. "You realize bad stuff happens and maybe you should be a bit more cautious."
For Gen X, the dot-com collapse hit early in careers. From 2001 to 2005, the tech sector shed a quarter of its workers, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by CompTIA, a technology education and research organization.
The layoffs that swept the industry were worse than the recession of the early 1990s, when total jobs in the tech sector fell by 5 percent, and the global financial crisis in 2008, when the work force contracted by 6 percent.
In 2011, the tech sector began a hiring boom that would last a decade. It added an average of more than 100,000 jobs annually, and by 2021, it had recouped all the jobs it lost when the dot-com bubble burst.
The job figures account for software, hardware, tech services and telecommunications companies, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Salesforce. But they may exclude some tech-related companies, such as Airbnb, Lyft and Uber, because of ambiguity in government labor market reporting that classifies some businesses as consumer services, said Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA.
The biggest job increases in tech came after the pandemic started, as companies rushed to fulfill surging demand. In 2022, the sector added nearly 260,000 jobs, according to CompTIA, the most it had added in a single year since 2000.
Tech's job increases continued last year even as big layoffs started, though it is unclear if that trend has stretched into this year. New job opportunities were a factor as nearly 80 percent of laid-off tech workers said they had found a new job within three months, according to a survey by ZipRecruiter.
"We're seeing the hiring mania of the pandemic being corrected for -- not the popping of a bubble," said Andy Challenger, senior vice president of the career transition firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Last fall, David Hayden, a program manager with a doctorate in physics, learned from his manager that he would be let go from nLight, a semiconductor company. Worried about how he would pay his eldest daughter's college tuition, he immediately reached out to recruiters to line up interviews. In December, a month after being let go, he started a position at Lattice Semiconductor.
In each interview, Mr. Hayden, 56, volunteered that he had been laid off, he said. His experience during the dot-com crash, when he avoided layoffs even as talented colleagues were let go, taught him that cuts aren't always rational.
"The shame of being laid off is gone," Mr. Hayden said. "Companies know that a lot of good people are being let go right now."
For Mr. Pulliam, losing his job at Coinbase was an opportunity. He funneled his severance money into his own business, Refactor Coaching, a career coaching service for software engineers.
"This is a gift," Mr. Pulliam said. "I don't think that story is told. It's always doom and gloom."
But for tech workers experiencing their first economic downturn, the cuts have been eye opening. Ms. Chang studied product design in college with an eye toward joining a tech industry that seemed recession proof. Being laid off from Lyft shook that faith.
Erin Sumner, a software recruiter at Facebook's parent company, Meta, used to brag to potential hires that the company had been the fastest ever to be valued at $ 1 trillion. She said she would promote the company's strengths, even last year as its stock price tumbled and its core business, digital advertising, struggled.
When rumors of layoffs began to circulate last year, she assured colleagues that their jobs were safe, pointing to the more than $ 40 billion in cash the company had in the bank. But in November, she was among 11,000 workers laid off.
"It was gut-wrenching," Ms. Sumner, 32, said. She has found a new job as the head recruiter for DeleteMe, a start-up that aims to remove a customer's information from search results. But she said she cringed each time she read about more tech layoffs.
"I fear it's going to get worse before it gets better," Ms. Sumner said. "There's no guarantee. I got laid off by the most secure company in the world."
A similar reversal of fortune has challenged businesses selling software services. Shares of Salesforce, an industry leader, fell nearly 50 percent last year as its sales growth slowed. The company had splurged during the pandemic, spending $ 28 billion to buy Slack Technologies. It swelled to 80,000 employees from 49,000 in two years.
During an all-hands meeting last week to discuss the company's decision to lay off 10 percent of its workers, Marc Benioff, the chief executive, tried to sympathize with his unhappy staff by putting the cuts in context.
"I've been through a lot of difficult times in this company. Every loss reawakens another loss for me," he said, according to a recording of the call heard by The New York Times. "Obviously, we're talking about a layoff. I think about employees who have died. I think about people we've lost that we never wanted to lose."
Asked what advice he had for employees who were anxious about the state of the company and further layoffs, Mr. Benioff suggested "gratitude."
Austin Bedford learned that he was one of about 8,000 people being let go from Salesforce when he tried to log on to his computer and had no access to Slack, the tool that he worked on as a conversation designer. A native of East Palo Alto, Calif., he studied computer design because he hoped to join one of profitable companies in his backyard. The job he landed at the company in 2021 fulfilled a dream. He never imagined he would lose it so soon.
"I was shocked," said Mr. Bedford, 41.
Though disappointed that he was laid off, he said he was trying to view being out of work as a "blessing in disguise" and intended to be selective about his next job.
"There's something bright around the corner," Mr. Bedford said. "I just need to have faith."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The layoffs amount to about 6 percent of the global work force at the company, the latest tech giant to make cuts after a pandemic hiring spree.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said on Friday that it planned to cut 12,000 jobs, becoming the latest technology company to reduce its work force because of concerns about a broader economic slowdown, after a hiring spree during the pandemic.
The job cuts are the company's largest ever, amounting to about 6 percent of its global work force. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said Alphabet had expanded too rapidly during the pandemic, when demand for digital services boomed, and must refocus on products and technology core to its future, like artificial intelligence.
"We hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today," Mr. Pichai said in a note to employees posted on the company's website.
Google joins a list of technology companies that have laid off workers after concluding they overextended under the belief that the pandemic-fueled boom represented a new normal. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Twitter are among others that have announced thousands of job cuts.
Technology firms have cut more than 190,000 jobs since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks the industry.
The moves mark the end of a period of rapid expansion in the technology industry, which battled for employees with lavish perks and high pay. Google, started in 1998, helped define a work culture that influenced corporations far beyond Silicon Valley.
Alphabet, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., had nearly 187,000 employees at the end of September, up from about 150,000 a year earlier.
In a note titled "A difficult decision to set us up for the future," Mr. Pichai said the job cuts would run across product areas, job responsibilities and locations. That future includes increased competition from rivals offering new ways to search for information on the internet; ChatGPT, a popular chatbot created by OpenAI, has dazzled users by providing clearly written answers to questions and queries.
"These are important moments to sharpen our focus, re-engineer our cost base and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities," Mr. Pichai said. "Being constrained in some areas allows us to bet big on others."
Last month, Google declared a "code red" in response to ChatGPT, with Mr. Pichai upending existing projects to concentrate on the field of artificial intelligence. With the job cuts, Google chipped away at efforts that are lower priorities.
Google Research, a pillar of the A.I. initiatives, cut roles in areas that have gotten less traction, including health care, according to an email that Jeff Dean, the senior vice president for research, health and A.I., sent to his employees. The company plans to streamline its investments in Google for Clinicians, a tool for health care providers. Google and Alphabet also consolidated robotics efforts, Mr. Dean added.
Google Cloud, which has hired at a breakneck pace over the last several years, also saw cuts. "Today's news primarily impacted positions that were non-customer facing, non-engineering and operational in nature," Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's chief executive, wrote in an email to employees. He added that the division would continue to hire in strategic areas, including product development and customer-related roles, to bolster its growth.
X, Alphabet's "moonshot factory," which incubates new companies, fired members of its strategy and business operations team, said two people with knowledge of the cuts, who were not authorized to discuss them. Many of the companies that were created in X have struggled to generate significant revenue and become profitable.
There were reductions in other parts of the company. Google fired 16 percent of its Fuchsia team, which had about 400 people working on operating systems for the company's home devices, one person said. A team in data center maintenance experienced cuts. Other engineers, user-experience researchers and product designers were also affected.
Even as Alphabet and other tech giants trim their work forces and pledge to become more efficient, they remain hugely profitable. In 2021, Alphabet had profit of $ 76 billion and revenue of nearly $ 258 billion.
The Alphabet Workers Union, which represents 1,100 members, criticized the cuts.
"With billions in profits and executive compensation untouched, our jobs should not be on the chopping block," Parul Koul, the union's executive chair, said in a statement.
But the technology industry has not been immune from rising interest rates and a slumping global economy. As the advertising market struggles and companies buy fewer ads on Google's search engine or on YouTube, which Google owns, Alphabet's bottom line took a hit. The company's cloud computing business has continued to trail Amazon and Microsoft. In October, Alphabet said quarterly net profit had fallen 27 percent.
Wall Street analysts hailed Alphabet's move. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI wrote in a research note that the job cuts were a necessary step to preserve profit. After the cuts were announced Friday, Alphabet's stock price rose more than 5 percent. The company will report its financial results for 2022 on Feb. 2.
Many employees at Google had been bracing for cuts as other large tech firms announced job losses. The closure of some small offices, and the release of a new employee evaluation system that was seen as a way to identify underperformers, signaled to many workers that the company was preparing for layoffs.
The layoffs were announced in the middle of the night in the United States, while many of the affected employees were asleep. They awoke to text messages, news stories and, in some cases, the realization that they no longer had access to Google's corporate systems.
Chewy Shaw, a site reliability engineer for YouTube who was let go on Friday, said the scale and speed of the layoffs was infuriating. "The authorities on high can come down at any surprising moment and just snap their finger and you're gone," Mr. Shaw said.
Alphabet said U.S. employees would receive a severance package that included 16 weeks of salary, plus two weeks of extra pay for every year they had worked at Google. Laid-off workers will receive six months of paid health care. Compensation for workers outside the United States will be determined by local labor laws, the company said.

In Davos, a Skirmish Over the Role Oil States Play in Climate Talks: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: John Kerry defended the choice of an oil executive to run the next climate talks while Greta Thunberg and others raised an alarm.
DAVOS, Switzerland -- John Kerry on Thursday offered a full-throated defense of the decision to hold this year's United Nations climate talks in the United Arab Emirates, one of the world's largest oil producers, suggesting the Gulf state was rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels and would not compromise the integrity of the negotiations.
"Don't judge a book by its cover," Mr. Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy, said in an interview on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
The United Arab Emirates, selected by the United Nations to host the November talks, has faced withering criticism from climate activists over its selection of Sultan Al Jaber, the head of its national oil company, to oversee the climate talks.
Mr. Kerry has worked closely with Mr. Al Jaber for years and called him a "good friend," adding that he believed the oil executive "would be a very serious and focused interlocutor on this."
He added that the United Arab Emirates, a major strategic ally of the United States, was moving rapidly to embrace renewable energy and reduce its planet-warming emissions in agriculture and other areas.
"There's an advantage to having a petrostate that is actually in the forefront of some of these cutting edge initiatives," Mr. Kerry said. "I think the U.A.E. is serious about it."
Hours after Mr. Kerry spoke, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, appeared in Davos and assailed the choice.
"Lobbyists have been influencing these conferences since basically forever and this puts a very clear face to it," she said at a news conference, wearing the muddy boots she had on when she was detained by the police while protesting a coal mine in Germany on Tuesday. "It's completely ridiculous."
Ms. Thunberg was joined by three other young female climate activists, Helena Gualinga of Ecuador, Vanessa Nakate of Uganda and Luisa Neubauer of Germany. The four have launched an online petition demanding that energy companies stop new oil, gas and coal projects.
Ms. Gualinga dismissed the idea that substantive negotiations over climate action could occur in the United Arab Emirates. "There's a huge conflict of interest there," she said. "It sends this message of not taking it seriously."
The climate protesters were joined at the news conference by Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency. Mr. Birol called for a rapid winding down of fossil fuels.
Former Vice President Al Gore, speaking at the main Davos conference and at side events, also lent his support to the activists.
"The appearance of a conflict of interest undermines confidence at a time when climate activists around the world, and I'm partly speaking for them right here on this stage, have come to the conclusion that the people in authority are not doing their job," a fiery Mr. Gore said in a panel discussion on Wednesday. "There's a lot of 'blah blah blah,' as Greta says, there are a lot of words, and there are some meaningful commitments. But we are still failing badly."
"We cannot let the oil companies and gas companies and petrostates tell us what is permissible," Mr. Gore added.
At last year's United Nations climate talks, known as COP27 and held in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, representatives from Saudi Arabia blocked language in the final agreement that would have called for a phasing out of fossil fuels.
Jo Sheldon, a spokeswoman for COP28, the talks scheduled for November, said Mr. Al Jaber was "an energy expert and founder of one of the world's leading renewable energy companies, a senior business leader, government minister and climate diplomat with more than 20 years of experience of taking climate action."
"He is uniquely qualified to deliver a successful COP28," Ms. Sheldon said. "He is determined to make COP28 a COP for all. And to make truly transformational progress it is critical that all stakeholders are at the table."
With the Russian war against Ukraine creating an energy crisis that has had the short-term effect of spurring more fossil fuel production, greenhouse gas emissions have reached a record high, even as solar, wind and other renewable sources are growing.
On Wednesday, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, issued a stern warning to the crowd gathered at Davos.
"We are flirting with climate disaster," Mr. Guterres said. "Every week brings a new climate horror story. Greenhouse gas emissions are at record levels."
Mr. Guterres added that the consequences of runaway warming "will be devastating" and that "several parts of our planet will be uninhabitable. And for many, this is a death sentence."
Meanwhile, business leaders sought to highlight their companies' eco-friendly bona fides.
On the main street of Davos, an Alpine resort town transformed into a giant trade show for the week, multinational corporations plastered idealistic slogans on storefronts they had transformed into temporary offices.
A Salesforce billboard featuring a smiling brown bear proclaimed that "Business is the greatest platform for change." Uber advertised that it was offering "All-electric Uber Green rides" all week in Davos. And the offices of SAP, the technology giant, featured the slogan, "When you put people first, we build a sustainable world together."
The World Economic Forum program featured a heavy dose of panel discussions and other programs addressing climate change and efforts to reduce emissions.
"Climate is top of the agenda," Jason Bordoff, a dean at the Columbia University Climate School said in an interview at the event. "The sense of urgency is not abating, but there is a new sense of realism that the gap between reality and ambition is getting bigger, not smaller. Now we need to make sure that the reality catches up with the ambition, and we need to meet people's energy needs along the way."
Marina Silva, Brazil's minister of environment and climate change, spoke on Tuesday and said that the newly installed government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was committed to helping stop planetary warming by protecting the Amazon rain forest.
"We are back to the international agenda to talk about climate, to talk about ambitious targets for the climate and biodiversity," Ms. Silva said.
While temperatures remained below freezing for most of the week, an abnormally warm winter has left much of the area with far less snow than usual, a reminder of the changing climate. In Davos, some ski runs were shuttered and the winter sledging run, a popular diversion for overwhelmed conference attendees, was closed for a lack of snow.

Remote Work Takes a Toll On Downtown Lunch Spots: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Downtown lunch spots that rely on catering to white-collar professionals are rethinking their business model as more employees work from home.
It's a tough time for companies that cater to the needs of office workers. For some, like downtown lunch spots that rely on servicing white-collar professionals, remote work options could pose an existential risk.
Sweetgreen, the fast-casual salad chain, is feeling the pain, the DealBook newsletter reports. Its stock has fallen more than 60 percent in the past 12 months. In November, the company noted the effect of the shift to hybrid working practices in its third-quarter earnings report. Inflation is also making its already premium-priced salads even more expensive, pushing the cost of a Cobb salad to around $ 14 in Manhattan.
Companies in the nation's downtown districts that depend on the spending of office workers are wondering whether business will come back. CBRE, the commercial real estate firm, says the role of the office is changing permanently. A survey of big office tenants found that 71 percent of respondents were looking to expand hybrid work arrangements in the next three years.
Layoffs, particularly in the tech industry, are also leaving office spaces empty. On Wednesday, Microsoft became the latest tech giant to announce job cuts as it tries to trim costs, following on the heels of similar announcements from Amazon, Meta, Salesforce and others.
Higher interest rates are also weighing on the commercial real estate sector as many landlords are stuck with aging office buildings that have become too expensive to upgrade. Compounding the problem, tenants are not renewing their leases and instead opting for smaller spaces.
Those industry trends could pose a long-term risk for companies like Sweetgreen, which has been pushing online options to replace in-person sales. For now, analysts are still bullish on the company because it has moved to build digital sales and loyalty. In the third quarter, 60 percent of Sweetgreen's orders were made through online channels, compared with 37 percent at Chipotle and about 40 percent across Yum Brands, and Sweetgreen is piloting a subscription service.
Mitch Reback, Sweetgreen's chief financial officer, noted on a call with analysts in August that the "erratic urban recovery" caused a "sales growth lag," but he said he remained "confident" that downtown locations would recover. The company laid off 5 percent of its work force last year.

Microsoft Announces Layoffs To Cut Costs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Microsoft on Wednesday became the latest addition to a growing list of big technology companies that have announced plans to lay off employees because of overhiring during the pandemic and worries about the economy.
The company will lay off 10,000 workers, Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, said, as it looks to trim costs amid economic uncertainty and to refocus on priorities such as artificial intelligence.
Microsoft employed about 221,000 workers as of the end of June, and the cuts amount to less than 5 percent of its global work force.
With the cuts, Microsoft joined a string of other tech giants that have pulled back after several years of frenetic hiring to meet the pandemic-fueled surge in online services and the expansion of cloud computing. The technology industry grew more rapidly than it had in decades, rivaling the expansion of the dot-com boom in the 1990s.
Microsoft and its peers responded to surging customer demand by essentially hoarding technical staff. But the market slowed last year as workers started to return to their offices, inflation squeezed budgets and consumers sought entertainment outside their homes.
"The reality is you can adjust hiring very quickly, and that is what is going on," said Brad Reback, an analyst at the investment bank Stifel. "I don't think this is symptomatic of a bigger issue."
The industry's deceleration has been particularly hard on smaller tech firms, and companies that specialized in newer concepts like crypto have been significantly affected. But tech's giants have not been spared. Among the industry's big companies, Google's parent company, Alphabet, and Apple are the only firms yet to announce significant layoffs.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Mr. Nadella said that after rapid acceleration during the pandemic, "quite frankly we in the tech industry will also have to get efficient." He added that the industry "will have to show our own productivity gains" using its own technology.
Still, some of the tech industry's biggest companies continue to measure their profits in the tens of billions of dollars. In the quarter ending in September, Microsoft had $ 50 billion in sales that produced $ 17.6 billion in profit. It has also continued to return money to investors through quarterly dividends and a $ 60 billion share buyback program authorized by its board of directors in 2021.
The company's annual revenue grew 58 percent over three years, during which time it hired more than 75,000 people. But rising interest rates and the prospect of a recession have tempered Microsoft's outlook. In the latest quarter, it reported its slowest growth in five years and warned that more tepid results could follow.
Microsoft's stock price closed down nearly 2 percent on Wednesday and is down about 22 percent in the past year, which is better than many of its tech peers. The company is scheduled to report its next quarterly earnings on Tuesday.
Microsoft is going forward with several expensive bets, including potentially putting another $ 10 billion into its investment in OpenAI, which makes the explosively popular ChatGPT artificial intelligence system, and a $ 69 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision that is facing challenges globally by antitrust regulators.
Mr. Nadella said in a message to staff that the layoffs "are the kinds of hard choices we have made throughout our 47-year history to remain a consequential company in this industry that is unforgiving to anyone who doesn't adapt to platform shifts."
The layoffs, which began on Wednesday and will continue through March, are the company's largest in roughly eight years. Mr. Nadella cut about 25,000 jobs over the course of 2014 and 2015 as Microsoft abandoned its ill-fated acquisition of the mobile phone maker Nokia.
Despite the high-profile layoffs from some of the biggest names in tech -- Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others -- the broader labor market remains generally strong. Cooling wage growth has provided some investors optimism that it will relieve pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates, but hiring has slowed only slightly.
The skills of engineers and other technical talent are still in high demand. Those who are laid off will likely find roles directly in industries like banking, retail or health care, which are undergoing the digitization of their operations, rather than at big tech firms themselves, labor analysts and recruiters say.
Customers are seeking "to do more with less," Mr. Nadella wrote to employees. "We're also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one," he added.
The changes, including severance and other restructuring expenses, will cost $ 1.2 billion, Mr. Nadella said. In a regulatory filing, Microsoft said some of the costs would come from consolidating office leases, as well as "changes to our hardware portfolio."
Microsoft makes the Surface line of laptops and tablets, and demand for personal computers has fallen sharply from the pandemic highs, when companies and families purchased laptops to work and study from home. In October, Amy Hood, the company's finance chief, told investors that the slowdown in consumer PC sales that started in September would continue through at least June.
Mr. Nadella said the company would continue to hire in strategic areas, and called advances in artificial intelligence "the next major wave of computing."
Other tech giants have also been reducing costs. Amazon began what is expected to be a huge round of layoffs on Wednesday, as part of its plans to cut its corporate work force by about 18,000 jobs.
"The exit out of Covid this past year was challenging," Doug Herrington, who heads Amazon's retail and operations business, wrote Wednesday morning in a message to staff obtained by The New York Times.
He added that although the company had trimmed expenses, "we've determined that we need to take further steps to improve our cost structure so we can keep investing in the customer experience that attracts customers to Amazon and grows our business."
Mr. Herrington wrote that the company would continue to invest in areas including health care and grocery.
The business software company Salesforce said this month that it planned to lay off 10 percent of its work force, or about 8,000 employees, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced at the end of last year that it was cutting more than 11,000 jobs.

Microsoft to Lay Off 10,000 Workers as It Looks to Trim Costs

Microsoft on Wednesday became the latest addition to a growing list of big technology companies that have announced plans to lay off employees because of overhiring during the pandemic and worries about the economy.
The company will lay off 10,000 workers, CEO Satya Nadella said, as it looks to trim costs amid economic uncertainty and to refocus on priorities such as artificial intelligence.
Microsoft employed about 221,000 workers as of the end of June, and the cuts amount to less than 5% of its global workforce.
With the cuts, Microsoft joined a string of other tech giants that have pulled back after several years of frenetic hiring to meet the pandemic-fueled surge in online services and the expansion of cloud computing. The technology industry grew more rapidly than it had in decades, rivaling the expansion of the dot-com boom in the 1990s.
Microsoft and its peers responded to surging customer demand by essentially hoarding technical staff. But the market slowed last year as workers started to return to their offices, inflation squeezed budgets and consumers sought entertainment outside their homes.
“The reality is you can adjust hiring very quickly, and that is what is going on,” said Brad Reback, an analyst at the investment bank Stifel. “I don’t think this is symptomatic of a bigger issue.”
The industry’s deceleration has been particularly hard on smaller tech firms, and companies that specialized in newer concepts like crypto have been significantly affected. But tech’s giants have not been spared. Among the industry’s biggest companies, Apple and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, are the only ones yet to announce significant layoffs.
Speaking at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Nadella said that after rapid acceleration during the pandemic, “quite frankly we in the tech industry will also have to get efficient.” He added that the industry “will have to show our own productivity gains” using its own technology.
Still, some of the tech industry’s biggest companies continue to measure their profits in the tens of billions of dollars. In the quarter ending in September, Microsoft had $50 billion in sales that produced $17.6 billion in profit. It has also continued to return money to investors through quarterly dividends and a $60 billion share-buyback program authorized by its board of directors in 2021.
The company’s annual revenue grew 58% over three years, during which time it hired more than 75,000 people. But rising interest rates and the prospect of a recession have tempered Microsoft’s outlook. In the latest quarter, it reported its slowest growth in five years and warned that more tepid results could follow.
Microsoft’s stock price closed down nearly 2% Wednesday and is down about 22% in the past year, which is better than many of its tech peers. The company is scheduled to report its next quarterly earnings Tuesday.
Microsoft is going forward with several expensive bets, including potentially putting another $10 billion into its investment in OpenAI, which makes the explosively popular ChatGPT artificial-intelligence system, and a $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision that is facing challenges globally by antitrust regulators.
Nadella said in a message to staff that the layoffs “are the kinds of hard choices we have made throughout our 47-year history to remain a consequential company in this industry that is unforgiving to anyone who doesn’t adapt to platform shifts.”
The layoffs, which began Wednesday and will continue through March, are the company’s largest in roughly eight years. Nadella cut about 25,000 jobs over the course of 2014 and 2015 as Microsoft abandoned its ill-fated acquisition of mobile phone maker Nokia.
Despite the high-profile layoffs from some of the biggest names in tech — Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others — the broader labor market remains generally strong. Cooling wage growth has provided some investors optimism that it will relieve pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates, but hiring has slowed only slightly.
The skills of engineers and other technical talent are still in high demand. Those who are laid off will likely find roles directly in industries like banking, retail or health care, which are undergoing the digitization of their operations, rather than at big tech firms themselves, labor analysts and recruiters say.
Customers are seeking “to do more with less,” Nadella wrote to employees. “We’re also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one,” he added.
The changes, including severance and other restructuring expenses, will cost $1.2 billion, Nadella said. In a regulatory filing, Microsoft said some of the costs would come from consolidating office leases, as well as “changes to our hardware portfolio.”
Microsoft makes the Surface line of laptops and tablets, and demand for personal computers has fallen sharply from the pandemic highs, when companies and families purchased laptops to work and study from home. In October, Amy Hood, the company’s finance chief, told investors that the slowdown in consumer PC sales that started in September would continue through at least June.
Nadella said the company would continue to hire in strategic areas, and called advances in artificial intelligence “the next major wave of computing.”
Other tech giants have also been reducing costs. Amazon began what is expected to be a huge round of layoffs Wednesday, as part of its plans to cut its corporate workforce by about 18,000 jobs.
“The exit out of COVID this past year was challenging,” Doug Herrington, who heads Amazon’s retail and operations business, wrote Wednesday morning in a message to staff obtained by The New York Times.
He added that although the company had trimmed expenses, “we’ve determined that we need to take further steps to improve our cost structure so we can keep investing in the customer experience that attracts customers to Amazon and grows our business.”
Herrington wrote that the company would continue to invest in areas including health care and grocery.
The business software company Salesforce said this month that it planned to lay off 10% of its workforce, or about 8,000 employees, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced at the end of last year that it was cutting more than 11,000 jobs.

Coinbase Sheds Another 20% of Its Employees: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The cuts at the cryptocurrency exchange come after nearly a fifth of employees were let go in June, as crypto markets teeter and tech companies rethink their growth plans.
Coinbase, the cryptocurrency trading platform, said on Tuesday that it would lay off about 20 percent of its employees, its latest move to cut costs as crypto markets decline and tech companies lower their expectations for growth.
The company is laying off about 950 people, it said in a memo to staff, which comes after it cut around 1,100 employees in June, also about a fifth of its work force at the time.
Brian Armstrong, Coinbase's chief executive, said in the memo that "in hindsight, we could have cut further" in the layoffs announced last year. He also implied that the collapse of FTX, which generated turmoil throughout the crypto industry, was having an impact on Coinbase.
"In 2022, the crypto market trended downwards along with the broader macroeconomy," Mr. Armstrong wrote. "We also saw the fallout from unscrupulous actors in the industry, and there could still be further contagion."
The downturn in crypto has put pressure on companies like Coinbase, which went public in 2021 and expanded rapidly during the pandemic. The price of Bitcoin has fallen more than 70 percent from its 2021 peak.
A number of technology companies, including Amazon, Meta and Salesforce, have recently announced layoffs, with many -- like Coinbase -- saying that they hired too aggressively during a burst of activity in the earlier stages of the pandemic. Higher interest rates, stubborn inflation and other factors that slowed the economy since then have forced many executives to rethink their plans.
Coinbase said its latest cuts were part of a plan to reduce costs by 25 percent this quarter. The layoffs would cost between $ 149 million and $ 163 million, Coinbase said. The company is offering employees who were laid off at least 14 weeks of base pay, health insurance and assistance finding a next job.
Still, Mr. Armstrong said some of the recent developments in the crypto world, including the fall of what he described as "a large competitor," could "end up benefiting Coinbase greatly."

Entertaining but Untrustworthy: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a recent afternoon Jonas Thiel, a socioeconomics major at a college in northern Germany, spent more than an hour chatting online with some of the left-wing political philosophers he had been studying. These were not the actual philosophers but virtual recreations, brought to conversation, if not quite life, by sophisticated chatbots on a website called Character.AI.
Mr. Thiel's favorite was a bot that imitated Karl Kautsky, a Czech-Austrian socialist who died before World War Two. When Mr. Thiel asked Kautsky's digital avatar to provide some advice for modern-day socialists struggling to rebuild the worker's movement in Germany, Kautsky-bot suggested that they launch a newspaper. "They can use it not only as a means of spreading socialist propaganda, which is in short supply in Germany for the time being, but also to organize working class people," the bot said.
Kautsky-bot went on to argue that the working classes would eventually "come to their senses" and embrace a modern-day Marxist revolution. "The proletariat is at a low point in their history right now," it wrote. "They will eventually realize the flaws in capitalism, especially because of climate change."
Over the course of several days, Mr. Thiel met with other virtual scholars, including G.A. Cohen and Adolph Reed Jr. But he could have picked almost anyone, live or dead, real or imagined. At Character.AI, which emerged this summer, users can chat with reasonable facsimiles of everyone from Queen Elizabeth or William Shakespeare to Billie Eilish or Elon Musk (there are several versions). Anyone you want to invoke, or concoct, is available for conversation. The company and site, founded by Daniel De Freitas and Noam Shazeer, two former Google researchers, is among the many efforts to build a new kind of chatbot. These bots cannot chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to.
In late November, OpenAI, a San Francisco artificial intelligence lab, unveiled a bot called ChatGPT that left more than a million people feeling as if they were chatting with another human being. Similar technologies are under development at Google, Meta and other tech giants. Some companies have been reluctant to share the technology with the wider public. Because these bots learn their skills from data posted to the internet by real people, they often generate untruths, hate speech and language that is biased against women and people of color. If misused, they could become a more efficient way of running the kind of misinformation campaign that has become commonplace in recent years.
"Without any additional guardrails in place, they are just going to end up reflecting all the biases and toxic information that is already on the web," said Margaret Mitchell, a former A.I. researcher at Microsoft and Google, where she helped start its Ethical A.I. team. She is now with the A.I. start-up Hugging Face.
But other companies, including Character.AI, are confident that the public will learn to accept the flaws of chatbots and develop a healthy distrust of what they say. Mr. Thiel found that the bots at Character.AI had both a talent for conversation and a knack for impersonating real-life people. "If you read what someone like Kautsky wrote in the 19th century, he does not use the same language we use today," he said. "But the A.I. can somehow translate his ideas into ordinary modern English."
For the moment, these and other advanced chatbots are a source of entertainment. And they are quickly becoming a more powerful way of interacting with machines. Experts are still debating whether the strengths of these technologies will outweigh their flaws and potential for harm, but they agree on one point: The believability of make-believe conversation will continue to improve.
The art of conversation
In 2015 Mr. De Freitas, then working as a software engineer at Microsoft, read a research paper published by scientists at Google Brain, the flagship artificial intelligence lab at Google. Detailing what it called "A Neural Conversational Model," the paper showed how a machine could learn the art of conversation by analyzing dialogue transcripts from hundreds of movies.
The paper described what A.I. researchers call a neural network, a mathematical system loosely modeled on the web of neurons in the brain. This same technology also translates between Spanish and English on services like Google Translate and identifies pedestrians and traffic signs for self-driving cars navigating city streets.
A neural network learns skills by pinpointing patterns in enormous amounts of digital data. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat.
The neural system described in the Google paper was far from perfect but seemed to chat like a real person every once in a while:
Human: what 's your name ?
Machine: i 'm julia .
Human: when were you born ?
Machine: july 20th .
Human: what year were you born ?
Machine: 1977 .
Human: where are you from ?
Machine: i 'm out in the boonies.
Human: are you a man or a woman ?
Machine: i 'm a woman .
Human: why are we here ?
Machine: i 'm not sure .
When Mr. De Freitas read the paper, he was not yet an A.I. researcher; he was a software engineer working on search engines. But what he really wanted was to take Google's idea to its logical extreme.
"You could tell this bot could generalize," he said. "What it said did not look like what was in a movie script."
He moved to Google in 2017. Officially, he was an engineer on YouTube, the company's video-sharing site. But for his "20 percent time" project -- a Google tradition that lets employees explore new ideas alongside their daily obligations -- he began building his own chatbot.
The idea was to train a neural network using a much larger collection of dialogue: reams of chat logs culled from social media services and other sites across the internet. The idea was simple, but it would require enormous amounts of computer processing power. Even a supercomputer would need weeks or even months to analyze all that data.
As a Google engineer, he held a few credits that allowed him to run experimental software across the company's vast network of computer data centers. But these credits would grant only a small fraction of the computing power needed to train his chatbot. So he started borrowing credits from other engineers; as the system analyzed more data, its skills would improve by leaps and bounds.
Initially, he trained his chatbot using what is called an LSTM, for Long Short-Term Memory -- a neural network designed in the 1990s specifically for natural language. But he soon switched to a new kind of neural network called a transformer, developed by a team of Google A.I. researchers that included Noam Shazeer.
Unlike an LSTM, which reads text one word at a time, a transformer can use multiple computer processors to analyze an entire document in a single step.
Google, OpenAI and other organizations were already using transformers to build what are called "large language models," systems suited for a wide range of language tasks, from writing tweets to answering questions. Still working on his own, Mr. De Freitas focused the idea on conversation, feeding his transformer as much dialogue as possible.
It was an exceedingly simple approach. But as Mr. De Freitas likes to say: "Simple solutions for incredible results."
The result in this case was a chatbot that he called Meena. It was so effective that Google Brain hired Mr. De Freitas and turned his project into an official research effort. Meena became LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications.
The project spilled into the public consciousness early last summer when another Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, told The Washington Post that LaMDA was sentient. This assertion was an exaggeration, to say the least. But the brouhaha showed how quickly chatbots were improving inside top labs like Google Brain and OpenAI.
Google was reluctant to release the technology, worried that its knack for misinformation and other toxic language could damage the company brand. But by this time Mr. De Freitas and Mr. Shazeer had left Google, determined to get this kind of technology into the hands of as many people as possible through their new company, Character.AI.
"The technology is useful today -- for fun, for emotional support, for generating ideas, for all kinds of creativity," Mr. Shazeer said.
Designed for 'plausible conversation'
ChatGPT, the bot released by OpenAI to much fanfare in late November, was designed to operate as a new kind of question-and-answer engine. It is pretty good in this role, but the user never knows when the chatbot will just make something up. It may tell you that the official currency of Switzerland is the euro (it's actually the Swiss franc) or that Mark Twain's Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County could not only jump but talk. A.I. researchers call this generation of untruths "hallucination."
In building Character.AI, Mr. De Freitas and Mr. Shazeer had a different objective: open-ended conversation. They believe that today's chatbots are better suited to this kind of service, for now a means of entertainment, factual or not. As every page on the site notes, "Everything Characters say is made up!"
"These systems are not designed for truth," Mr. Shazeer said. "They are designed for plausible conversation."
Mr. De Freitas, Mr. Shazeer and their colleagues did not build one bot that imitates Elon Musk and another that mimics Queen Elizabeth and a third that parrots William Shakespeare. They built a single system that can imitate all those people and countless others.
It has learned from reams of general dialogue as well as from articles, news stories, books and other digital text describing people like Elon Musk, Queen Elizabeth and William Shakespeare.
The system also has a way of combining disparate concepts learned during training. The result is a practically endless collection of bots that can imitate a practically endless collection of people, riffing on a practically endless number of topics, as Mr. Thiel found when he chatted with the Karl Kautsky bot:
JonasThiel: Marxists in your time were very confident that revolution was a historical inevitability. In light of recent defeats socialists across the world have suffered and the lack of class struggle, even in times of great suffering, do you think it is time to revise that view?
Karl Kautsky: I do not. We may have made mistakes with our tactics, but I refuse to believe that socialism is a pipe dream. I still believe that the proletariat must break the chains of capitalism, and that the working class must unite around marxism. We must remember that capitalism is still deeply flawed and that it is our job as socialists to agitate and spread class consciousness.
JonasThiel: I completely agree, but wasn't it wrong to assume workers uniting to overthrow the bourgeoisie was inevitable? After all, the capitalist class is very powerful and it is hard for workers to come together to resist collectively rather than individually.
Karl Kautsky: You are right, it was a mistake to be over optimistic in that regard. But I find it better to believe in class consciousness and revolution until I am proven wrong. What is the alternative? Believing the workers will stay in chains forever? I don't agree with that. It is better to struggle against capitalism despite our odds then to give in. I refuse to believe the workers will never wake up. Even if I am over optimistic, we must not give in to pessimism. I refuse to be proved wrong. I hope you can understand.
Sometimes, the chatbot gets things right. Sometimes, it doesn't. When Mr. Thiel chatted with an avatar meant to imitate Mr. Reed, the 20th-century American political thinker, it turned him into "some kind of militant Maoist, which is definitely not right."
Like Google and OpenAI and other top labs, Mr. De Freitas, Mr. Shazeer and their colleagues plan on training their system with ever larger amounts of digital data. This training can take months, and millions of dollars; it can also sharpen the skills of the artificial conversationalist.
Researchers say that the rapid improvement of the past several years will last only so long. Richard Socher, former head of A.I. at Salesforce who now runs a start-up called You.com, believes these exponential improvements will begin to level off over the next few years, when language models reach a point when they have analyzed pretty much all the text on the internet.
But Mr. Shazeer believes the runway is much longer. "There are billions of people in the world generating text all the time," he said. "People will keep spending more and more money to train smarter and smarter systems. We are nowhere near the end of that trend."

Full text: As the economy slows, a handful of prominent C.E.O.s have tried to put an end to remote work. But some economists say that even in a cooler labor market, working from home is likely to remain common.
The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend, providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in business. If you don't already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here .
During the nearly three years since pandemic precautions pushed remote work into the mainstream, companies have been negotiating a "new normal" in an environment that some say gives workers an upper hand: Hiring has been difficult, quitting has been popular, and employers had been in a good position to accommodate workers' preferences.
That era is over. While the labor market remains tight even as many forecast that the United States will fall into a recession, most economists expect more layoffs and fewer job openings in the coming months as companies rethink how they operate. This week, Amazon said it would cut 18,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its corporate work force, and Salesforce said it planned to lay off 10 percent of its employees, or about 8,000 staff members. Goldman Sachs is preparing to lay off as many as 4,000 people.
As the workplace shifts, some prominent chief executives see an opportunity to get their employees back in the office. In May 2021, David Solomon, C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, told workers to get ready to return the next month to encourage more in-person collaboration and shared culture. Elon Musk ended Twitter's "work from anywhere policy" in his first email to employees after acquiring the company last year, saying he would require them to work at least 40 hours a week from the office. Bob Iger stopped short of an office mandate when returning to Disney as chief executive in November, but he reportedly told employees that "I worry long term about the negative impact on people who have decided not to spend as much time at the office."
But is the pandemic-induced remote work experiment about to end? Economists studying the shift to more flexible workplaces say it is not likely despite the push by some of the world's most high-profile C.E.O.s.
Hybrid work is establishing itself as the new normal
Last year, remote work stabilized at well above prepandemic levels, according to data compiled by a group of researchers at Stanford University, the University of Chicago and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México.
In 2019, around 5 percent of full paid working days in the United States were completed remotely, according to census data. But when the research group started gathering data for the U.S. Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (S.W.A.A.), a monthly poll of workers, that proportion jumped to more than 60 percent in May 2020. For the past year, the percentage has been hovering around 30 percent.
"We are all back to prepandemic trends in online shopping, but permanently up on online work," said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford and a co-author of the monthly survey.
The most common remote work situation, according to the S.W.A.A. and a number of other surveys, is now hybrid work, with employees spending some days in the office and some working remotely. Companies, industries and individual situations vary greatly on preferences and the feasibility of remote work, but on average, both sides have similar ideas about the ideal amount of time to spend in the office.
In the December S.W.A.A. survey, workers able to do their jobs from home said they preferred to operate remotely about 2.8 days per week. Their employers planned to allow them to work from home about 2.3 days per week. That's not a big gap in expectations.
There are obvious reasons employees say they like working remotely: They want to avoid the time and costs of commuting; they focus better without office chatter; they feel it's better for their well-being to be at home. When McKinsey, the consultancy, asked 12,000 job seekers last year about their reasons for looking for a new job, "flexible working" came in just behind "greater pay or hours" and "better career opportunities."
What often gets glossed over -- and one reason some economists believe that a recession would have little impact on the shift in working arrangements -- is that allowing employees to operate outside of the office can also benefit companies.
In a survey conducted by ZipRecruiter, the employment search site, job seekers on average said they would take a 14 percent pay cut in order to work remotely.
While the labor market remains strong, the economy is slowing down, and companies are looking for ways to make their jobs more valuable without raising pay. And many of them say they're using remote work to do it.
"It's not that there won't be some loss of bargaining power by workers," said Steven Davis, a professor at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the S.W.A.A. "It's just that many employers have their own independent reasons to think that the shift, the partial shift, to remote work is beneficial for them as well."
Managers are finding it hard to reverse the changes
For a working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Mr. Bloom, Mr. Davis and others asked the hundreds of senior business executives who are surveyed each month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta if they had expanded remote work as a way to "keep employees happy and to moderate wage-growth pressures." Thirty-eight percent said they had done so in the past 12 months, including half of executives working in sectors such as finance, insurance, real estate and professional services. Forty-one percent said they planned to do so in the next year.
The authors used executives' estimates for how much they saved in pay by offering remote work to conclude that it would cut companies' salary bill by 2 percent over two years.
"That's not huge," Mr. Davis said. "But what it suggests is that there are non-trivial benefits to many firms from remote work."
A downturn could even make remote work more, not less, sticky. Recruiting more widely, including in cities where the cost of living is lower than where a company is headquartered, could mean paying lower salaries (though in some industries, such as tech, there is some evidence that salaries in different cities are converging).
Workers with an option to log in remotely may also take fewer sick days or decide to work remotely when they would previously have taken a day off to attend a friend's wedding or extend a holiday.
Of course, there are costs to remote work, too. Managers and workers often disagree about which environment is most productive. And working virtually can involve security considerations, new software purchases and compliance headaches around hiring in multiple states or countries. But, Mr. Davis said, in a lot of cases, companies have already paid for those costs. "We had almost three years of experience doing this," he said.
Perhaps the most practical reason that companies may hold on to remote work in a recession is that it is difficult to revoke. Even Musk, a little more than a week after mandating full-time office work, reportedly clarified that all that was required of employees who wanted to work remotely was an approval from a manager willing to take responsibility for ensuring excellent work (albeit at the risk of being fired).
"Many, many companies in recent months have insisted that people come back to the office five days a week, only to reverse that mandate within about a week after hearing that they'd lose their best and brightest," said Julia Pollak, the chief economist ZipRecruiter.
Remote work, Ms. Pollak added, "is not just used as a sort of perk in a tight labor market that's going to go away in a slacker labor market."

Hiring Is Healthy But Pace Receded During December: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Federal Reserve's moves to cool the economy with higher interest rates seem to be taking gentle hold. Wage growth lost momentum.
The U.S. economy produced jobs at a slower but still comfortable rate at the end of 2022, as higher interest rates and changing consumer habits downshifted the labor market without bringing it to a halt.
Employers added 223,000 jobs in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department reported on Friday, in line with economists' expectations although the smallest gain since President Biden took office.
The gradual cooling indicates that the economy may be coming back into balance after years of pandemic-era disruptions -- so far with limited pain for workers. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5 percent, back to its level from early 2020, which matched a low last seen in 1969.
"If the U.S. economy is slipping into recession, nobody told the labor market," said Chris Varvares, co-head of U.S. economics for S&P Global Market Intelligence, noting that the December number is still nearly double the approximately 100,000 jobs needed to keep up with population growth.
Stocks jumped on the news. The S&P 500 gained 2.3 percent, reflecting expectations that a slowdown in job growth and wage gains could reduce the pressure on prices and make the Federal Reserve less aggressive in raising interest rates.
The report brought job creation for the year to 4.5 million, pending revisions, as the economy continued to recover from its plunge in 2020. Still, total employment is still millions short of where it was headed before the pandemic, with job losses predicted in the year ahead.
The Biden administration trumpeted the report, calling it evidence that its economic agenda has been working. "For the last two months, we've seen good job growth, we've seen wage rates go up, and we've seen inflation pressures come down," Labor Secretary Martin J. Walsh said in an interview. "I think it's a slow and steady approach to bring down inflation and not worry about going into a recession."
Avoiding a recession, of course, is far from guaranteed. That will depend on the Fed's ability to edge interest rates just high enough to contain inflation but not so much that the economy enters a downward spiral -- a balancing act that the Fed itself isn't sure is possible.
The slowdown in hiring in recent months is a sign that the Fed's strategy may finally be constraining the labor market, which remained a standout even as some drivers of economic activity started to sputter. Wage growth eased to 4.6 percent over a year ago, as the frenzy of people reshuffling into new jobs -- and demanding better pay -- has faded.
So far, layoffs and initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained extremely low, while the gap between the number of available workers and listed jobs is far larger than its historical average.
Nonetheless, the Fed forecasts that the extremely low unemployment rate will rise to about 4.6 percent by the end of this year, as its interest rate increases force companies to retrench. For the Fed's prediction to come true, employers would have to shed well over a million jobs in 2023.
"We're not expecting to see job losses right now, but how do you get to one million jobs fewer over the next year?" asks Christine Cooper, chief U.S. economist at the real estate data firm CoStar. "We're going to have to see some negative numbers."
December's gains were driven by strong hiring in leisure and hospitality, which added 67,000 jobs, and health care, with 55,000. State government employment would have been significantly higher if not for a strike by 48,000 workers at the University of California. Even sectors that had been wobbling, such as retail, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, eked out small increases.
But certain hard-hit industries like hotels and restaurants still haven't regained their prior strength, and have struggled to attract -- and keep -- enough workers to satisfy surging consumer demand. Others that had explosive growth while catering to Covid-era lifestyles are fading fast.
Interest rate increases have directly affected the labor market by taking the air out of the tech sector; the information services category dropped 5,000 jobs in December. That doesn't include the bulk of 18,000 recently announced layoffs at Amazon, or the 8,000 at Salesforce.
Rising borrowing costs have also hamstrung home sales, resulting in sharp cuts at mortgage brokerages. But in an example of how backlogged demand is still powering even industries sensitive to interest rates, construction employers have continued to add jobs at a solid pace.
That could change soon, as order books stabilize. Erica Goodnight runs a lumber supplier in Harmony, N.C., that serves people building backyard sheds, barns and other outbuildings. The company did brisk business as homeowners added more space during the pandemic, but this year Ms. Goodnight is sitting tight on hiring.
"We've found a sweet spot," Ms. Goodnight said. "I don't necessarily foresee any openings. And honestly I think a lot of companies, if the employee will stay and show up for work, they're not removing positions, because they got burned when they laid off employees in the beginning stages of Covid, and those folks didn't come back."
That steady easing is also evident in the number of hours the average worker puts in each week, a figure that has been falling for months and is now on the lower end of its prepandemic range.
Fed officials watch wage increases closely, concerned that they will continue to propel inflation as spending shifts from goods to services, where salaries largely drive prices. The cooler number in December may provide some reassurance that they can continue the path of stepping down interest rate increases that the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, communicated last month as inflation also subsided.
"That sort of orderly progression suggests that the economy is moving in ways that we will start to see that imbalance disappear," Raphael Bostic, a Fed governor, said at a conference of economists in New Orleans on Friday, while cautioning that he expected rates to remain high throughout 2023.
Over the past year, the darkest shadow over the labor market has been the glacial recovery in the share of people either working or looking for work, which remains about a percentage point lower than its level in February 2020. The rebound may be speeding up, as household savings accumulated during the pandemic have dwindled and fast inflation has pushed Americans to take on extra work.
Marshall Chandler would like to stop working, at 69, but his shrunken 401(k) account won't let him. For the past three years, he has been selling high-end Swiss watches at Breguet on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where he says his age is more of an asset than a handicap.
"I would not object to being retired now, but it's just not realistic for me," Mr. Chandler said. "If the market restrengthens and my health continues to be good, I hope to be able to retire in four to five years."
The labor force participation rate ticked up slightly to 62.3 percent in December, as more than 400,000 people entered the labor force, most of them women.
That's something Rebecca Rogers Tijerino, the president of Spherion Staffing and Recruiting, has noticed. More applicants have come through her company's doors over the past quarter, allowing her to fill open listings more quickly.
Along with rising costs, headlines about a looming recession can also drive people to look for more solid positions. "We've seen people proactively concerned about the 'R' word," Ms. Tijerino said. "If they're not on firm ground with their current employer, they're looking to make a change."
The number of people employed by temporary help services -- which historically dips as employers try to shed labor while keeping their permanent employees in an uncertain economic environment -- dropped by 35,000, and is down 111,000 jobs since July.
Workers are not the only ones worried about a recession. Measures of corporate sentiment, like a recent survey of chief financial officers by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, are at a low ebb, boding ill for employment gains in the coming year. The Institute for Supply Management found that manufacturing contracted for the second straight month in December, indicating that more companies see business worsening rather than getting better.
That's why experts, while encouraged by the latest numbers, caution against declaring a premature happy ending to the pandemic recovery story.
"We're reading that book, and it's getting really good, but we're not done," said Kathryn Edwards, an adjunct economist at the RAND Corporation. "I would hate for the interpretation of this jobs report to be, 'We did it."'

Salesforce to Lay Off 10% of Staff and Cut Office Space: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The software company plans to cut around 8,000 jobs as business slows for tech companies. "We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn," Salesforce's chief executive said.
Salesforce, the business software giant, said on Wednesday that it planned to lay off 10 percent of its work force, or about 8,000 employees, and scale back office space because of concerns about the economy.
"The environment remains challenging, and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions," Marc Benioff, the company's co-chief executive, said in a note to employees announcing the cuts.
Salesforce's revenue, like that of many other technology companies, boomed during the pandemic when more people around the world worked from home and relied more heavily on technology to collaborate with colleagues remotely. In his letter, Mr. Benioff suggested that the company had hired too aggressively during that period.
Salesforce employed just under 80,000 people at the end of October, up from about 48,000 three years earlier.
"We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we're now facing, and I take responsibility for that," Mr. Benioff said.
A Salesforce spokeswoman said the company had no further comment on the cuts.
The layoffs cast the tech industry's slowdown into even sharper relief. In recent months, tech giants like Amazon have slowed down hiring and cut jobs, while smaller companies like Lyft and Stripe have also announced layoffs. Many of the industry's largest firms have reported financial results suggesting they were feeling the effects of stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates.
Social media companies have struggled with a pullback in digital advertising in particular. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, cut 13 percent of its employees in November and said its head count would remain "roughly flat" through the end of this year. Snap, Snapchat's parent company, laid off 20 percent of its employees in August, blaming challenging macroeconomic conditions. Elon Musk, who purchased Twitter for $ 44 billion in October, has slashed the company's work force by more than half.
Salesforce's sales grew 14 percent in its latest quarter, the slowest pace in years; it projected even slower growth in its current quarter. Other tech chiefs, like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, have recently admitted to hiring too many people as they rushed to make cuts. More than 150,000 tech workers were laid off last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts.
In November, Bret Taylor, Salesforce's co-chief executive, announced that he would resign from his post and leave at the end of this month. In December, Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive of Slack, a workplace communication platform owned by Salesforce, also said he would leave his position by the end of this month. Salesforce bought Slack for $ 27.7 billion in 2020.
Salesforce is the largest private employer in San Francisco, and its flagship office building is the city's tallest.
The company estimated that the changes would cost up to $ 2.1 billion. Salesforce is offering U.S. employees a minimum of five months of pay, as well as health insurance and career resources, Mr. Benioff said. Most of the cuts will be made "over the coming weeks," he wrote.
Salesforce's shares rose more than 3 percent in trading on Wednesday. The company's stock price fell nearly 50 percent last year.

As Growth Slows, Amazon Announces It Will Expand Layoffs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The layoffs will focus on human resources and its retail division, Amazon's chief executive said in an email to employees.
Amazon plans to eliminate 18,000 corporate and technology jobs in a significant expansion of its cost-cutting plans, the company's chief executive, Andy Jassy, said in an email to employees on Wednesday.
The company previously planned to lay off roughly 10,000 employees late last year and early this year, The New York Times reported in mid-November. The first layoffs were primarily focused on the company's devices and books organizations. Employees in human resources were also given buyout offers to resign.
The new wave of layoffs will begin on Jan. 18, Mr. Jassy said, and will focus on human resources as well as the large division that Amazon refers to as Stores. That includes the teams behind Amazon's main online site, its vast field operations and warehouses, its physical stores and other consumer teams.
The 18,000 in total cuts represent roughly 6 percent of Amazon's corporate work force. Late last year, managers in a variety of groups said they had been asked to prepare for potential layoffs, and employees have been bracing for the cuts.
Hourly warehouse workers are not included in the layoffs. Amazon has typically reduced those jobs through high attrition.
"These changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure," Mr. Jassy wrote. "However, I'm also optimistic that we'll be inventive, resourceful and scrappy in this time when we're not hiring expansively and eliminating some roles."
The company more than doubled its work force during the pandemic as customers flocked to online services. It had about 1.5 million employees at the end of September.
Amazon's growth, however, slowed to its lowest rate in two decades, and Mr. Jassy has been reeling in the company's overexpansion. Amazon recently cautioned investors that growth could weaken to its slowest pace since 2001.
Mr. Jassy said the expanded reductions were the result of Amazon's annual business review, which this year "has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we've hired rapidly over the last several years."
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Wednesday that Amazon had expanded its planned job cuts.
Amazon is among a number of tech companies that have recently announced significant cuts. Salesforce, the giant business software company, said on Wednesday that it planned to lay off 10 percent of its work force, or about 8,000 employees, amid concerns about the economy. Other companies, including Meta and Twitter, have had big layoffs in recent months.

Major Indexes Rally After Report on Jobs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street closed broadly higher Wednesday after wavering for much of the day as investors weighed the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting of policymakers and welcomed encouraging data on job openings.
The major indexes rallied following a government report showing that job openings increased more than expected in November. Stocks then shed some of their gains after the minutes from the Fed meeting last month underscored how the central bank remains determined to keep rates high to crush inflation.
The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent after having been down 0.2 percent in the early going. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq composite added 0.7 percent. Small company stocks outpaced the broader market, lifting the Russell 2000 index 1.2 percent higher.
The Fed raised its key short-term interest rate last month for the seventh time in 2022 and signaled more hikes to come. Still, the increase was smaller than those announced after its previous four meetings, reflecting signs that inflation, while still high, has been showing signs of easing.
The minutes from the mid-December meeting show that Fed officials remained determined to keep rates high and have taken little comfort from inflation's decline from a peak of 9.1 percent in June to 7.1 percent in November.
Stocks marched higher before the 2 p.m. Eastern release of the Fed minutes after the government reported that the number of job openings in November was higher than expected. While that could maintain pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates high to fight inflation, the resilience in the labor market also bolsters hopes on Wall Street that the economy can avoid sliding into a protracted recession.
"I think the market is trying to figure out if the recession indeed comes, will it be a bad one," said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. "I think investors are right, that if we do fall into a recession, it's not going to be a deep and prolonged recession."
The latest update on job openings is the first set of employment data that Wall Street will get this week. The government will release its weekly unemployment report on Thursday and its closely watched monthly employment report, for December, on Friday.
The strong jobs market helped insulate a weakening economy from slipping into a recession in 2022. The Fed, though, is trying to lower inflation with its rate increases and that also means it needs to cool employment.
The minutes from the central bank's last policy meeting shows Fed officials suggested that a continuing streak of robust hiring could keep inflation elevated and was a key reason they expected to raise interest rates this year more than they had previously forecast.
The Fed's benchmark lending rate stands at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, up from close to zero following seven increases last year. It forecast that the rate will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023 and it isn't calling for a rate cut before 2024.
Crude oil prices fell and Treasury yields ended lower Wednesday.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, fell to 3.71 percent from 3.75 percent late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, slipped to 4.34 percent from 4.38 percent.
Banks, companies that rely on consumer spending and communications stocks accounted for a big share of the rally. Citigroup rose 2.6 percent, Starbucks added 3.6 percent and Netflix gained 4.9 percent.
Energy stocks fell as the price of U.S. crude oil settled 5.3 percent lower. Chevron fell 1.1 percent. But more than 80 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 notched gains.
The latest updates for the job market come amid more layoffs within the technology sector, which has been dealing with falling demand as inflation squeezes consumers.
Investors cheered several companies that decided to make cuts to their workforces as they face weaker demand. The cloud computing software company Salesforce rose 3.6 percent after it announced it is laying off about 10 percent of its work force. The video hosing platform Vimeo rose 4 percent after reportedly notifying workers about job cuts.

Salesforce to Lay Off 10% of Staff and Cut Office Space

Salesforce, the business software giant, said Wednesday that it planned to lay off 10% of its workforce, or about 8,000 employees, and scale back office space because of concerns about the economy.
“The environment remains challenging and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions,” Marc Benioff, the company’s co-chief executive, said in a note to employees announcing the cuts.
Salesforce’s revenue, like that of many other technology companies, boomed during the pandemic when more people around the world worked from home and relied more heavily on technology to collaborate with colleagues remotely. In his letter, Benioff suggested that the company had hired too aggressively during that period.
Salesforce employed just under 80,000 people at the end of October, up from about 48,000 three years earlier.
“We hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that,” Benioff said.
A Salesforce spokesperson said the company had no further comment on the cuts.
The layoffs cast the tech industry’s slowdown into even sharper relief. In recent months, tech giants like Amazon have slowed down hiring and cut jobs, while smaller companies like Lyft and Stripe have also announced layoffs. Many of the industry’s largest firms have reported financial results suggesting they were feeling the effects of stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates.
Social media companies have struggled with a pullback in digital advertising in particular. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, cut 13% of its employees in November and said its head count would remain “roughly flat” through the end of this year. Snap, Snapchat’s parent company, laid off 20% of its employees in August, blaming challenging macroeconomic conditions. Elon Musk, who purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October, has slashed the company’s workforce by more than half.
Salesforce’s sales grew by 14% in its latest quarter, the slowest pace in years; it projected even slower growth in its current quarter. Other tech chiefs, such as Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, have recently admitted to hiring too many people as they rushed to make cuts. More than 150,000 tech workers were laid off last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts.
In November, Bret Taylor, Salesforce’s co-chief executive, announced he would resign from his post and leave at the end of this month.

The company estimated that the changes would cost up to $2.1 billion. Salesforce is offering U.S. employees a minimum of five months of pay, as well as health insurance and career resources, Benioff said. Most of the cuts will be made “over the coming weeks,” he wrote.
