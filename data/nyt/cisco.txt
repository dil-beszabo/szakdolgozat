Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amid a fresh backlash against D.E.I. efforts, OneTen met resistance as a program for Black workers only. It has shifted its emphasis to "equity for all" and a more hands-on approach.
Three years ago, dozens of big companies formed a coalition and declared an ambitious goal: to lift one million Black workers into good-paying jobs over the next 10 years, by hiring or promoting them.
The resulting nonprofit, OneTen, was created amid a crescendo of calls to address racial injustice after George Floyd's murder in 2020. It asked its members -- including AT&T, Bank of America, Cisco, Delta Air Lines, Dow, General Motors, Nike and Walmart -- to pledge to hire and promote Black workers based on skills instead of college degrees.
Fast-forward, and the social climate has since changed drastically. Pushing Black-only hiring programs has grown increasingly controversial, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling last year against race-based affirmative action policies at universities.
OneTen, which has fallen far behind the pace needed to reach its initial goal, is at the forefront of a movement to adopt diversity, equity and inclusion methods in business. And it has been forced to change with the times.
The organization has modified its messaging in the past year, especially since the Supreme Court decision, to emphasize that the policies it advocates will help "Black talent and others."
More concretely, the organization's leaders realized that asking companies to vow to make changes was not enough. OneTen has helped its members rewrite job descriptions for hundreds of roles to remove unnecessary degree requirements and clearly state the skills sought and needed. The organization has helped to design apprenticeship programs for enterprises like Delta and the Cleveland Clinic, tailored for different fields. And it has set up a network for human resources and hiring managers to share their challenges and suggest solutions, in virtual and in-person sessions.
OneTen also works to establish links among employers, training programs and workers.
"The beginning has been tough -- we've learned lessons," said Kenneth Frazier, a founder and chairman of OneTen and former chief executive of Merck. "But we still have aspirations to make a big difference."
Many companies are rethinking their diversity efforts after the Supreme Court's ruling, and states including Florida and Texas passed laws to curtail D.E.I. policies. Lawsuits have been filed threatening businesses like a fund in Atlanta focused on backing Black female entrepreneurs.
Recent research suggests a pullback from practices such as requiring diverse candidate pools when interviewing to fill jobs. And the resignation of Claudine Gay, a Black woman, as president of Harvard has been celebrated by opponents of D.E.I. initiatives in academia and business who claimed she was a diversity hire.
Pfizer and two law firms, Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie, opened their diversity fellowships last year to students of all races, after lawsuits against them alleged racial discrimination.
"There is diversity fatigue," said Debbie Dyson, chief executive of OneTen. "What we're doing can't be 'This is a diversity thing.' Skills give you an alternative path."
OneTen, whose founders include prominent Black business leaders like Mr. Frazier and Kenneth Chenault, former chief executive of American Express, promoted skills-based hiring from the start. More than 60 percent of all American workers do not have four-year college degrees, according to the Census Bureau. But requiring degrees in job postings hits minority applicants particularly hard, eliminating 72 percent of Black adults, for example.
Adopting skills-based practices, work force experts say, can help companies tap a broader pool of high-performing, dedicated workers, while increasing career opportunities and household incomes for millions of Americans. One study estimated that up to 30 million workers without four-year college degrees have most of the skills to succeed in better jobs paying 70 percent more.
OneTen began with a "superaggressive" goal and a diversity message, said Plinio Ayala, chief executive of Per Scholas, a nonprofit job-training program. The shift toward emphasizing skills, he said, "makes a lot more sense and is gaining traction."
OneTen's collaboration with Delta is a case study in the organization's revised approach.
Following the OneTen playbook, the airline has removed the four-year-degree requirement from 94 percent of its job listings, including for pilot roles. Previously, about half the jobs at Delta required a college degree.
The company initially heard internal criticism that OneTen was only for Black workers. But like OneTen itself, Delta moved to emphasize that skills-based hiring and promotion can benefit all workers.
"What has been very helpful is equity for all, and we're really leaning into that equity-for-all message," said Joanne Smith, chief people officer at Delta.
OneTen has also helped the airline create an apprenticeship program designed to move hourly workers into salaried positions with career tracks that typically pay wages of at least $ 60,000 a year.
The one-year apprenticeships involve classroom and on-the-job training, mentoring and support services. Graduates are guaranteed jobs. The program, which began as an experiment with six workers in 2021, had grown last year to a group of 56, who were selected from 7,000 applicants.
Sanassa Diane was part of that group. She started at Delta in 2018 in a call center. "When you called the 1-800 number, I was the person on the other end of the call," she said.
Ms. Diane, 28, rose up the call center hierarchy to become a customer support representative for an invitation-only service mainly for Delta's most lucrative frequent fliers, although she was still paid hourly.
A little over a year ago, Ms. Diane entered the apprenticeship program, gaining a salaried job in the corporate sales department arranging contracts and deals for Delta's business-customer accounts. Her pay rose more than 50 percent.
At first, the transition was daunting, she recalled, and she had "impostor syndrome," the sense of not belonging in a work setting. Delta arranged for an outside workplace coaching firm to help her manage the anxiety.
"Stepping into the corporate world can be challenging or scary, if you're not used to it," she said.
Ms. Diane, who dropped out of college, is taking courses toward a bachelor's degree in technology and management, and plans to work her way up the corporate ladder at Delta.
Despite Delta's embrace of skills-based hiring, the approach has yet to take off more broadly. In a OneTen survey last year of 500 hiring managers, 56 percent said removing four-year degree requirements would improve their hiring practices, but only 31 percent are doing it.
Those numbers point to the gap between recognizing an issue and altering corporate behavior, said Ginni Rometty, chairwoman of OneTen and former chief executive of IBM. "That requires culture change," she said. "And it does take time."
Having refined its approach, OneTen is making progress, but it's still far behind the million-jobs-in-a-decade pace embedded in its name. So far, the coalition of companies has elevated 108,000 people who meet the OneTen definition -- Black workers without four-year college degrees hired or promoted into jobs that pay family-sustaining wages, as measured by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's living-wage calculator.
In 30 percent of its allotted time, OneTen is about 10 percent of the way to its goal, even though its roster of member employers has nearly doubled to 65 companies.
Mr. Chenault, the former American Express chief, is now a managing director of General Catalyst, a venture capital firm. He compares OneTen to "a start-up that's in Year 3." It started with one focus, then saw a bigger opportunity and made a pivot.
"Yes, we're focused on African Americans, but there is this broader opportunity," he said. "If a company is going to skills-first practices, they are going to do it for everyone."
OneTen's expansion plans include working with community colleges as sources of talent and military bases as large civilian employers. But already, OneTen estimates that the income gains for the more than 100,000 Black workers its coalition partners have hired or promoted add up to $ 12 billion.
Demographic trends could also help persuade employers to change. America's working-age population is aging, shrinking and becoming more diverse. Millions of jobs are unfilled because of a lack of skilled workers.
"There is a fundamental business reason for companies to convert to a skills-based hiring system, beyond all the social justice themes that got us off the ground," said Mr. Frazier, the chairman of OneTen.

What the Rich Wear While Out Getting Groceries: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a personal assistant to a well-to-do retiree, Nora Szigeti is tasked with much of the usual fare: managing a calendar, booking travel, running errands. But after her 70-year-old boss recently came across an Instagram post shared by the account Class of Palm Beach, which documents outfits people have worn around that wealthy town, she took on another duty: publicist.
"My boss would be a perfect person for your site," Ms. Szigeti, 50, recalled writing in a message to the account in November. Soon after, her employer, Oblio Wish, appeared in a video shared by Class of Palm Beach, in which she showed off her wardrobe full of items from Dior, Gucci and Chanel.
She is one of the hundreds of Palm Beach residents and visitors -- whose ages have ranged from 20-something to 80-something -- who have been featured on Class of Palm Beach's Instagram, TikTok and Facebook accounts since they were started last March. Its accounts on those three platforms now have a combined audience of more than one million followers.
On the 14-mile-long island, Class of Palm Beach functions for some as a sort of social-media-age Shiny Sheet, a nickname for the Palm Beach Daily News, a paper that fills its pages with photographs from society galas and luncheons.
For others, like Ms. Szigeti, its accounts offer a near-daily glimpse into how the ultrarich dress. (A report from the U.S. Census Bureau listed the median household income in Palm Beach between 2018 and 2022 as $ 190,824.) Brunello Cucinelli, Zimmermann, and Hermès are names often uttered by people featured on the Class of Palm Beach accounts, many of whom can be seen clutching Chanel bags.
"For them, it's so ordinary: 'Oh, today I'm wearing a Rolex, and it's just a Birkin,"' Ms. Szigeti said of how casually some of the accounts' subjects can refer to watches and bags most people only dream of owning. "I have to save up two years to buy even half the Birkin."
Devorah Ezagui, 28, who lived in Palm Beach for part of her childhood, started the Class of Palm Beach accounts after moving back to the area last year. She had previously been living in New York, where she had been juggling personal training and marketing gigs, and where she would often ask people on the street about their outfits, she said.
The fashion in Palm Beach involves the same labels worn in other wealthy enclaves, but the way people wear them evokes a certain lifestyle, Ms. Ezagui said. The accounts, she added, were meant to showcase that lifestyle and offer an escape, as well as fashion inspiration.
Alanna Strei, a real estate agent in San Diego who discovered Class of Palm Beach on Instagram, said she appreciated its aesthetic of "old money glam" and its aspirational tone. Ms. Strei added that she also likes how the account features a breadth of people, not just "Real Housewives of Miami" types, as she put it.
Ms. Ezagui's videos for Class of Palm Beach are mostly man-on-the-street interviews in which she probes subjects about their clothes, accessories and fragrances while filming them on her iPhone. The approach is similar to that of other social media accounts that have started documenting outfits in well-heeled locations like Madison Avenue in New York and Greenwich, Conn.
Ms. Ezagui, whose wardrobe includes Celine flats and Maison Margiela denim shorts, is also a personal stylist to clients in the Palm Beach and New York areas. She said she spent at least four hours a day managing the Class of Palm Beach accounts, which have shared sponsored posts paid for by brands.
The accounts have also featured a few of the clients Ms. Ezagui has styled, she said, but most subjects are strangers she has encountered while out and about, whether shopping at a local Publix grocery store or at stores on Worth Avenue, a ritzy retail strip.
Though she has been to Mar-a-Lago, the residence of former President Donald J. Trump, she has yet to document any outfits there. "It was actually something I wanted to look into," she said. But there are "strict rules" about "going over to other people's tables" at the private club, she added.
The types of people she looks for have effervescent personalities and appear to have "really put intention into their outfit," she said. Ms. Ezagui added that about 70 percent of those she has asked to feature have agreed.
Most of those people are white women, a trend some followers of the accounts have pointed out in comments. Ms. Ezagui said the demographics of those featured was less reflective of her choices than it was of Palm Beach's population. A recent Census Bureau report found that about 94 percent of the town's residents were white and zero percent were Black.
"There's not everybody in this area," Ms. Ezagui said.
Some followers have also asked that she focus on a younger crowd. But Ms. Ezagui said that videos of older subjects reliably got more attention. "I know what will do well," she said.
On a rainy Saturday in January, as she was walking along Worth Avenue, Ms. Ezagui stopped to praise the outfit of a passerby, Carolina Paulino, who was wearing Zimmermann separates, Loro Piana shoes, an Hermès handbag and Cartier bracelets. Then came the question: Would she want to be filmed for a video?
Ms. Paulino, 28, who had come to have lunch in Palm Beach from Miami, agreed. She later said the outfit she was wearing was meant to evoke a "vibe of luxury, but beach."
Ms. Ezagui said that some people had asked her to feature fewer subjects in designer clothes and more in stylish items from affordable retailers like TJ Maxx. But to her, luxurious labels are a key element to Class of Palm Beach's success.
"People are trying to look for inspiration," she said.

Keswick, Va. | $ 9.995 Million
An 1856 estate with five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, on a 286-acre lot
This house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, has been updated by the sellers, who installed new appliances, a new electrical system and new plumbing during renovations, and also uncovered original floorboards and an original kitchen fireplace, which is now the centerpiece of a lower-level den.
The property is about a half-hour drive from the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville. Driving to Richmond or Fredericksburg takes just over an hour. Washington is two hours away.
Size: 7,586 square feet
Price per square foot: $ 1,318
Indoors: A long, gated driveway leads from the road up to the main house, where a paved path connects to the front entrance.
The front doors open into a foyer with high ceilings and original wood molding. To the right is a living room with a fireplace that has a simple white mantel and tall, deep-set windows overlooking the grounds. To the left is a dining room with another fireplace, more tall windows and a crystal chandelier.
The dining room connects to a bright kitchen outfitted with custom-made Officine Gullo components and a center island with a soapstone counter. A powder room is also in this part of the house.
The rear hall, accessible from the kitchen and the foyer, has a grand flying staircase that leads to the three bedrooms on the second floor.
The primary suite, to the right of the stair landing, has a fireplace and windows overlooking the grounds in the bedroom; the bathroom, which was once a guest room, has another fireplace, a shower with a glass door and a deep soaking tub. The other two bedrooms, across the hall, are each big enough to hold a queen-size bed and have en suite bathrooms.
The stairs continue to the top level, which holds a den, two more guest rooms and a full bathroom.
Another den and a pub with a built-in bar are on the lowest level of the house, where there was once a kitchen. A full bathroom, a laundry room and a mudroom are also on this level.
Outdoor space: The property includes several buildings, including a guest cottage with a kitchen, a classic red barn and a workshop that could be used as an art studio or events space. There is a pool within walking distance of the main house, along with a pool house in what was once the carriage house, with a bathroom and a laundry room. There is ample space for parking in the driveway, and plenty of room to add a garage.
Taxes: $ 34,128 (estimated)

A 1913 Colonial Revival house with eight bedrooms, seven full bathrooms and two half bathrooms, on a 2.8-acre lot
Designated House Beautiful magazine's Whole Home of 2023, this house was decorated by 15 design firms led by female designers who collaborated with J. Jordan Homes, a builder, to create a showplace of décor. Materials used include English pine paneling, custom paint and wallpaper, and, in one room, a repurposed 18th-century chimney piece.

Size: 13,879 square feet
Price per square foot: $ 721
Indoors: A brick driveway leads from the street to the portico-covered entrance at the front of the house.

Outsider vs. Insider: Does It Matter?: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Looking Back," the nonprofit gallery's group show, brings together self-taught and highly trained artists. It isn't obvious who's who.
It's pleasantly disorienting to enter the White Columns Annual in New York in 2024 and see so much work that could have been, and was, made any time in the last half century. There's not a screen, QR code or 3-D print in sight. But since its inauguration in 2006, the nonprofit gallery's "Looking Back" series has made an old-school proposition: to curate a group show around one person's (or collective's) taste, shorn of commercial or institutional impulses to either move product or capture a zeitgeist.
The Annual has one constraint. The curator must have seen the included work in New York City in the previous year. In this grass-roots way, the show offers a (very subjective, and therefore narrow) group portrait of an increasingly unwieldy scene. Those who see a lot of art might recognize a few pieces. But not everything.
The curator tapped for the 14th edition is Randy Kennedy, the director of special projects for the international art gallery Hauser & Wirth, and a former staff reporter at The New York Times who occasionally contributes to the obituaries desk. The pieces he picked here, by 35 artists, tend toward so-called outsider art, particularly abstract painting and assemblage that appears more felt than thought.
There are outsider staples, like two seductively muted paintings on board from the 1980s by the prolific Alabaman folk artist Mose Tolliver; and contemporary discoveries, particularly the self-taught Moroccan-American sculptor Manal Kara, whose "Unidentified Mathematical Objects (lottery picker 2)," a random-number generator made from a fur-lined fruit crate, screwdriver handles and multisided dice, debuted at Deli Gallery in TriBeCa in 2023. Its deft scrappy aesthetic, applied to a modern symptom like the Powerball, winks at the stereotype of the outsider artist as visionary naïf.
Sharing space with diamonds-in-the-rough are accomplished figures known for rough-hewed work, such as an undated wall-mounted junk assemblage by Noah Purifoy and one of Beverly Buchanan's chunky scrap wood maquettes of her shacklike studio.
Kennedy's Annual muddies the already murky boundary between inside and outside. Whatever superficial cues might distinguish one from the other don't hold here. They shouldn't elsewhere, either -- curators and critics have worked against this hierarchy for decades. These approachable works are an encouraging sign of a leveling playing field for artists, who may or may not have lived in a big city, gone to art school, had a gallery, or shared their art with a soul.
Yet the ongoing interest in deskilled, intuitive artmaking also speaks to the present sense of stagnation, even conservatism, as anxious artists and dealers retread safe ground, no matter how "meta" they're being. When the world feels chaotic, culture takes an inward turn.
Kennedy made several selections from last year's Outsider Art Fair, including the jaunty, arrowlike rows of "White and Yellow Carrots," by the self-taught artist Evelyn Reyes, who worked in a studio for adults with disabilities until 2017. A composition by an unknown painter named Richard E. Treubel titled "Egg in Reverse," from around 1965 -- squidges of golden impasto in a sea of yolk-yellow, cradling a white blob -- cuts its cosmic symbolism with a gonzo sense of humor.
One wall features several swirling mandalas pristinely plotted with a rainbow of ballpoint pens. They could be dazzling examples of process-based conceptual drawings from the 1970s -- but in fact were the retirement pastime of Harold Granucci, an accountant and furniture salesman, circa 1992. If the outsider can be meticulous, the insider can let loose: a gloopy white sculpture based on a ready Kleenex is the latest from Jennifer Bolande, a postmodern artist known for crisp and heady photographs and installations.
Some artists revel in the art world's margins. "Smoker Choice," a strip of wooden siding painted with bands of red, white and tan, resembles a glowing cigarette. It's a playful 2023 piece by Tyree Guyton, the artist behind the Heidelberg Project in Detroit, a junkyard fantasia of weathered toys, scrap metal and household discards assembled in a string of once-vacant lots. Guyton started Heidelberg in 1986, and gradually gained acceptance -- first from his neighbors, then from the art world. This work, which appeared at Martos Gallery in New York last year, would be funny anywhere, but in the context of a proper gallery in Manhattan shows Guyton gleefully mixing highbrow and lowbrow aesthetics, hard-edge abstraction from the Neo-Geo movement, with the beret-and-palette caricature of the chain-smoking artist, all through his signature urban materials.
Another demi-outsider, Sarah Rapson, attended the Whitney Independent Study Program in 1989, then worked for the blue-chip artist Richard Prince. About 20 years ago -- like Purifoy relocating to Joshua Tree, Calif.; or Buchanan to Macon, Ga. -- she moved to coastal England and abandoned the mainstream. But she kept tabs on it. Her collages made from what look like old gallery advertisements, wrapped around the ends of long sticks, are among the first works in the show, setting the scene for artists with a foot in both worlds.
A few pieces feel like the curator's inside jokes. A sequined tapestry by Larry Krone, Kennedy's brother-in-law, shares a wall with a pulsing, flame-colored abstraction drawn by Rhoda Kellogg, an early-childhood educator, from Kennedy's own collection. And one incongruous assemblage, a wooden cane fitted with a rifle scope hung above a postcard of the city hall in Cisco, Texas, is by the artist Will Boone -- which makes sense if you know that Kennedy and Boone, who are both from Texas, are writing a play about a dramatic 1927 bank robbery in that same town. It was an outside job.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When is it appropriate to wear a fully matching sweatsuit, top and bottom? When I see people wearing a paired sweatshirt and sweatpants, I sometimes think "cringe." And sometimes I can't help but want to wear it. Which side of me is right?
Pepper, New York Karl Lagerfeld, the Chanel designer whose talent for dramatic pronouncements was equaled only by his talent for dreaming up extraordinary clothes, once declared sweatpants "a sign of defeat."
That pronouncement would suggest that the full sweatpants-and-sweatshirt look, otherwise known as the sweatsuit, a shapeless pairing once synonymous with gym teachers and Rocky Balboa, is ... well, what? A sign of surrender?
Perhaps. Or perhaps, given that this is fashion and in fashion nothing is more certain than that which was out will be in again, it is the embodiment of an ironically triumphant return.
In truth, the sweatsuit has been making a comeback since the coronavirus pandemic. That period, when we prized comfort dressing over just about everything else, converged with Gen Alpha's celebration of all things Y2K, including that era-defining item, the Juicy Couture velour sweatsuit. That discovery was exacerbated by the Miu Miu-driven resurgence of the "set," be it Miuccia Prada's matching crop top and tiny skirt, Versace's shortie pajamas or, yes, the matching sweatsuit of yore.
Demna, the designer of Balenciaga known for reframing the totems of streetwear as luxury, picked up on this idea, embracing not just a signature oversize hoodie but the tracksuit, via his Balenciaga collaboration with Adidas in 2022. It was a slicker, more globalized version of the sweatsuit, and one with its own cultural semiology thanks to hip-hop. Last month, he went a step further and paid homage to the Juicy sweatsuit in his fall 2024 show.
TikTok embraced the trend, with influencers of all sorts discovering the joy of sweats -- they don't call them that exactly; more on that in a moment -- especially as a solution to all things airport.
"Suits" have gotten a bad rap, but the notion of pairing your top and your bottom to create an unbroken line and to suggest coordination aforethought remains an effective approach to dress. The sweatsuit has evolved beyond the usual fleece and baggy proportions and is now available in materials like cashmere and wool, often with smaller tops paired with looser bottoms. I wouldn't use them for jogging, but they are good for swanning around.
The details matter. Wear a sweatsuit with a sweatband and sneakers and you look like a victim of the endless cycle of New Year's workout resolutions. Wear it with a nice handbag and a trench coat and you look like a modern Jean Harlow out to take the air.
It's really a question of framing. Yes, the sweatsuit as we once knew it may be dead, but long live the lounge suit. Or, as influencers like to call it, the "matching sweatsuit set." It's kind of like the reinvention of Target as Tar-gét. Same word, whole new implication.

Makeup With a Bigger Purpose: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Karissa Bodnar played on her customers' desire to belong to something bigger than ... well, beauty.
On a recent Monday, Karissa Bodnar, the 34-year-old founder and chief executive of Thrive, a cosmetics company, arrived at a launch party for her latest product line. The setting: a fluorescent-lit, fifth-floor office in midtown Manhattan. The bells and whistles: cheese, crudités, basic beer and wine. The entertainment: a Bluetooth speaker playing early aughts hip-hop (Flo Rida, Lil Jon).
Over the next three hours, dozens of makeup artists, beauty editors and social media influencers accustomed to launch parties in far-flung locales like Tokyo and the South of France would drop by. Maybe.
"Respectfully, I don't care if editors and influencers show up or not," Ms. Bodnar said, surveying the windowless reception area. She wore a skirt suit of turquoise and silver sequins that cast a disco-ball glow across the floor. "I had $ 25,000 to spend, and I wasn't going to do a lunch at the Four Seasons or rent a house for the summer so influencers could go take selfies."
As far as beauty marketing goes, events like the two Ms. Bodnar cited are relatively thrifty. In January, Tarte conspicuously flew 50 influencers and their plus ones to Dubai and put them up at a Ritz-Carlton to celebrate the introduction of a foundation made with a "multitasking superfruit." Last year, Chanel flew influencers to Panama to fete a new beauty line; in 2017, Smashbox feted new products in Fiji.
For the April debut of Bigger Than Beauty, a set of skin-care products, Ms. Bodnar chose the headquarters of Bottomless Closet, a nonprofit that helps New York-area women in need enter the work force. "We found out about them through our community," Ms. Bodnar said. "We post on social media all the time and ask, 'What charities are moving you?"'
Thrive donated a million dollars of product but the real windfall for the nonprofit may have been the fairy godmother who chose to wave her wand over them.
"She's the star," Melissa Norden, the executive director of Bottomless Closet, said, gesturing at Ms. Bodnar. "People won't show up for us. They'll show up for her."
Much has been made of the Rihannas and Kylie Jenners of the beauty industry, celebrities who introduced best-selling cosmetics brands after developing an ardent following. One could argue that given the high profiles of their founders, Fenty Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics were destined for success. To build a brand -- and to fill a room -- Ms. Bodnar has played not on her name but on consumers' desire to do good with their dollars and belong to something bigger than ... well, beauty. Call her the Estée Lauder that hustle culture built.
"A lot of launch events would be at some swanky place," Ms. Bodnar told the assemblage. "I grew up on a dirt road. I don't know about you, but I'm kind of over the swanky events. I think this is the new swanky event -- being at places like Bottomless Closet." Cheers erupted.
'The Ultimate Unicorn'
If Ms. Bodnar was only about doing good, Thrive Causemetics -- the company's official name, one that gives pause to anyone with an ounce of skepticism -- would be a nonprofit.
"I've always thought of her as the ultimate unicorn," said Blythe Jack, a Thrive investor and a former partner at TSG Consumer, a private equity firm in San Francisco. "She built a wildly profitable business on almost no capital." Ms. Jack invested $ 100,000 in Thrive in 2017.
Thrive is a direct-to-consumer brand, avoiding the distribution fees associated with selling through Sephora or department stores. It's a common path for star-founded companies -- it's how Kylie Cosmetics started -- but star power can only do so much.
"Karissa was able to build community and brand loyalty before the marketplace got flooded and the pandemic shifted everything," said Priya Rao, the executive editor of the Business of Beauty, which chronicles the industry.
Thrive declined to comment on its annual revenues. "I don't want to be out there baring all to everybody," Ms. Bodnar said. "I've earned my spot."
The Reckoning
If Ms. Bodnar is cagey about specifics, it's because she has faced controversy. There's the plaintiff who sued Thrive in 2018, alleging that the company was not donating to charities in the way that it claimed. (The lawsuit resulted in a "stipulated" dismissal; Ms. Bodnar signed a non-disparagement agreement that precludes her from talking about it.) There are the trolls who harassed her on social media when Forbes added her, in 2019, to its "richest women" list.
"It was actually quite scary when that list came out," said Ms. Bodnar, who splits her time between Seattle and Los Angeles, where Thrive is headquartered.
Ms. Bodnar grew up in rural Washington State. "We went to church every Sunday, but Allure was my bible," she said. She worked at Sephora to pay her way through community college, which led to a job at the Seattle office of Clarisonic, a maker of a mechanical face brush that L'Oréal acquired in 2011.
"Among all these men on the team, she was very impressive," Carol Hamilton, the president for acquisitions for L'Oréal U.S.A., recalled. "She wanted to understand the 'why' of the work, how big companies operate."
In 2013, Ms. Bodnar's close friend, Kristy LeMond, who had been working in the nonprofit sector, died of soft tissue sarcoma, a rare cancer. Ms. Bodnar had a reckoning. She quit L'Oréal. She bought a bunch of makeup. She wrote a business plan in the notes app of her iPhone: vegan makeup with a business model that mimicked Toms and Warby Parker, the pioneers of the buy one, give one model.
She got a day job at Bulletproof, the supplement company, to finance her after-hours innovations, like false eyelashes that "work whether you have lashes or not," Ms. Bodnar said. "So much of what I heard in the beginning was, 'If a women's going through cancer, we tell her not to wear makeup.' I was like, 'That's not an acceptable response."'
Like any star, Thrive needed a breakout hit, and in 2014, Ms. Bodnar found hers: Liquid Lash Extensions, a mascara that encases eyelashes in tiny, ziti-like tubes. The mascara adheres to a degree that may find users ripping out their lashes if a generous amount of makeup remover isn't used to dissolve the residue.
Customers seemed unbothered. "Best mascara ever" reads a recent review on Thrive's website, one of more than 34,000 reviews posted for the mascara. "We sell one every five seconds," Ms. Bodnar said.
Social Conscience as a Strategy
Combined, Ms. Bodnar and Thrive have more than 830,000 Instagram followers; by comparison, L'Oréal U.S.A. has just over 150,000. Her direct messages with customers turn into real-life meet-ups: "This woman just invited me to run a half marathon," Ms. Bodnar said, showing her phone screen.
"The conglomerates are always looking to update their portfolios," Ms. Rao said, "and they're desperate to connect with millennial and Gen Z consumers in the way that Thrive has."
Ms. Bodnar said she has turned down offers to sell. What about an I.P.O.? "My goal is to donate a billion dollars," she said. Thus far, she has donated $ 125 million, which a public offering would likely preclude. "I'm not trying to create a flash-in-the-pan brand," she said.
Employee-generated content fuels Thrive's social media feeds as well as ire. An April, Instagram post of a male employee applying concealer, eyebrow gel and pressed powder generated a slew of hateful comments and disavowals like, "If this is turning into a 'woke' company, I'll stop buying."
"People get very upset about the L.G.B.T.Q.-plus and reproductive rights stances we take," Ms. Bodnar said. "I would have thought that those same people would care about our immigration support, but ...." She shrugged.
There are advantages to stoking discord.
"You might take a stance on a divisive issue because you know that your target customer is likely to take the same stance," said Jonah Berger, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "You may be doing it because you care about that issue, but you may also get attention from it."
Ms. Bodnar claims to care about making a difference but social conscience can also serve as a strategy. Half a dozen employees (the company has about 100, total) had filed in for a weekly product development meeting in a glass-walled conference room at Thrive headquarters on the west side of Los Angeles. Ms. Bodnar sat at the head of the table. Lipstick prototypes were smudged on hands and analyzed under varying shades of light. Someone brought up their competition.
"That makes me think of one of my favorite books," Ms. Bodnar said. "The Infinite Game" by Simon Sinek. "We think that business is a finite game," she said, "but you can't win a business in the same way that you can't win a friendship, or a marriage. He talks about worthy rivals."
"Who's a worthy rival?" she asked the room.
One employee: "Lululemon."
Another: "Patagonia."
Ms. Bodnar smiled. No one had mentioned another makeup brand. "OK," she said. "What's next?"

The Man Who Destroys Luxury Handbags: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Under the handle Tanner Leatherstein, Volkan Yilmaz rips, burns and slices apart luxury goods to show how much he thinks they are really worth.
One video opens with a large white leather handbag covered in the signature LV logo of Louis Vuitton. Within milliseconds, a hand with a switchblade swoops in and slashes a huge gash in the side of the bag before tearing it apart at its seams. In another, the distinctive red sole of Christian Louboutin is loudly ripped from a black stiletto using a wrench; in still another, scissors snip through a $ 2,200 Prada clutch before a man sets fire to a piece of the leather and turns it to ash.
You've entered the TikTok world of Tanner Leatherstein, which has more than 950,000 followers. Leatherstein, whose real name is Volkan Yilmaz, has attracted a cult following on the social media platform -- as well as on YouTube and Instagram -- for his butchering of exorbitantly expensive items. The reason, he says, is to show his viewers the true quality of the materials and craftsmanship and then break down how much the item may have cost to make.
"In many cases," Mr. Yilmaz said from his Dallas workshop in December, "my estimates come in at about a tenth of what the price tag says. The markups that underpin the luxury business still shock a lot of people."
In the edited interview below, Mr. Yilmaz, 37, discussed his lifelong obsession with leather, how much he spends on luxury products for his platform and what people should look for when buying new leather items.
When did your love of leather goods begin?
My family owned a tannery in Turkey, so I was born into the business. Around 11, I tanned five sheepskins to make my first leather jacket. While at college in Istanbul, I worked at the tannery, then went to China to learn about leather imports and exports and then to Turkmenistan.
In 2009, I won the U.S. green card lottery and moved to Chicago. I drove a cab while I got an MBA from the University of Illinois, then worked as a management consultant, which made me feel like I was dying inside. I was still obsessed with leather, so I started my own leather brand called Pegai, teaching myself about the design side from YouTube and driving Uber jobs to make ends meet. In 2019, once the business was underway, I moved to Dallas.
Why did you start creating social media content?
Friends and even friends of friends have always asked me to check their leather purchases. What do I think of the quality? Have they paid too much?
It made me realize that people don't actually know that much about how leather is sourced or used and are suspicious about the markups on luxury leather products. So I started making some videos to answer their questions. I didn't expect them to blow up the way they have.
More than anything else, you are known for slicing up bags. Why do you do that?
When I started dissecting bags, I wanted to show that price really wasn't about the leather or the materials used -- that it was mostly about the status associated with a label. So many people automatically assume that if it's expensive, it must be good.
What was the first bag you ever cut up?
It was a Louis Vuitton briefcase. Louis Vuitton is one of the most famous leather brands in the world, but many people don't know that the iconic LV monogram material is actually canvas. The first video that went viral was a little $ 1,200 wallet from Chanel. From then on, requests to feature different brands have been rolling in nonstop.
What are you looking for when you slash a bag?
The leather quality, of course. How it has been tanned. I use acetone to remove the finish, and I can see how much plastic makeup has been applied to the leather. I burn the leather to assess what tanning process has been used. Then I look at the craftsmanship, which is reflected in the stitching, hardware and construction.
A big part of what I do is assessing the brand's claims. A bag might look good from the outside, but when you rip it open and look inside, it tells another story.
Who are the almost two million followers you have on social media?
There is definitely a demographic who hate luxury brands, full stop, who think the pricing is a scam and that people who pay for them are stupid. Then there are people who just love the entertainment value of chopping up expensive products. But many people are watching the videos because they love luxury and want a better understanding of quality products. They want to assess their luxury or vintage purchases with their eyes open.
Which brands are worth the money?
Bottega Veneta uses incredible leathers, and I've done three or four videos on their beautiful products. Though in one video -- on a $ 650 wallet -- I cut it up, and the lining was made from a lower quality leather than the one described on the label. (Bottega did not respond to a request for comment).
I really like a Scottish label called Strathberry. They make their products in Ubrique, which is this small town in Spain where brands like Loewe and Dior make their goods. But Strathberry is a fraction of the cost -- more like $ 500 instead of $ 3,000. Polene is another great label made by people who really know what they are doing. Coach is pretty good at a mid-price point.
Are you ever shocked by what you find?
I don't get positively shocked -- I'm paying a lot of money. Great if we can show a bag to be great material and design, but that should be the standard.
Do brands reach out to you now?
Not really, and especially not from the luxury space. I don't accept free items or advertising opportunities. People will trust me only if I stay totally independent.
Lots of people will have given or received leather goods during the holidays. Any tips for them?
Trust your senses. Feel it. If it feels plasticky, that's not a good sign. Smell it. There isn't only one leather smell, but there is a pleasant, slightly earthy aroma to quality leather. It should not smell like chemicals.
Look at it. Leather is an animal-sourced product. It has variations to its grain and fiber structure. The more variations you see in the fabric, the more natural and untreated it is. If it's overdone with a heavy finish, leather becomes very standardized and lower quality hides can be hidden.

12 Key Music Collections, From Future to the Who: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Whitney Houston's gospel music, Future's prolific mixtape run, a chunk of Joni Mitchell's archives and a soundtrack of Brooklyn's early discos arrived in new packages this year.
Artists were eager to revisit the past in 2023 -- some tweaking recent albums (like Taylor Swift), others revisiting long-dormant work in the vaults (like the two surviving Beatles). Boxed sets and reissue collections serve a different purpose, helping put catalogs and musicians into context, and bringing fresh revelations to light. Here are a dozen of the best our critics encountered this year.
Julee Cruise, 'Floating Into the Night'
(Sacred Bones; one LP, $ 22)
The absorbing, unconventional debut album from the deep-exhale vocalist Julee Cruise, who died in 2022, was produced by Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch; the three had previously collaborated on music for Lynch's 1986 alt-noir film "Blue Velvet." This batch of songs, released in 1989, plays as an extension of that fun-house mirror, lightly terrifying universe, with twisted 1950s melodies meeting destabilizing, plangent guitars meeting Dali-esque shimmers. "Falling" became the theme song for "Twin Peaks" in instrumental form, but its full vocal version is the essential one. Songs like that, "The Nightingale" and "Into the Night" feel, even now, sui generis -- not exactly dream-pop or new age, but something utterly amniotic. And lightly harrowing, too. JON CARAMANICA
DeYarmond Edison, 'Epoch'
(Jagjaguwar; five LPs, four CDs, 120-page book, $ 130)
Bon Iver didn't come out of nowhere. Before he started that project, Justin Vernon was in DeYarmond Edison, a pensive, folky but exploratory band that made two albums before splitting up; other members formed Megafaun. DeYarmond Edison -- Vernon's middle names -- delved into folk, rock, Minimalism and bluegrass, learning traditional songs but also experimenting with phase patterns. It made two studio albums and left behind other songs, including "Epoch." This extensively annotated boxed set includes songs from Mount Vernon, DeYarmond Edison's jammy predecessor, along with DeYarmond Edison's full second studio album (though only part of its first), unreleased demos, intimate concerts, collaborations outside the band and Vernon's 2006 solo recordings. It's a chronicle that opens up the sources of a style getting forged. JON PARELES
Future, 'Monster,' 'Beast Mode' and '56 Nights'
(Epic; one LP each, $ 21.98)
During six months in the mid-2010s, the Atlanta hip-hop escapist Future remade himself during a daring and powerful three-mixtape run. He'd come into this stretch flirting with pop acclaim, but emerged something like a folk hero. There are some true hits on these releases, including the narcoleptic, charming "Codeine Crazy" and the ecstatic yelp "March Madness." But lesser-heard songs like the howling "No Compadre," the melancholic "Where I Came From" and the antic "Wesley Presley" are almost as effective. And Future's sheer volume of recording, leaning on producers like Zaytoven and Southside, showed the versatility and relentlessness that still makes him a star almost a decade later. The quirky persistence of physical media -- as decoration and historical codification and perhaps even as music delivery vehicle -- means that mixtapes, when they're important enough, end up getting hard-pressed into vinyl. So for the first time, these mixtapes (or slightly streamlined versions of them, alas) are officially available for physical collections, not just virtual ones. CARAMANICA
Nanci Griffith, 'Working in Corners'
(Craft Recordings; four CDs, $ 55; four LPs, $ 125)
The Texas-born singer-songwriter Nanci Griffith, who died in 2021 at age 68, sometimes called her music "folkabilly" -- a fitting description for a sound that blended reverent traditionalism with honky-tonk sweat. Though beloved by a devoted cult audience, Griffith mostly flew under the radar of the mainstream, so the recently released boxed set "Working in Corners" provides a welcome opportunity to reassess her legacy. Included here are Griffith's first four albums, some of which have long been out of print, along with liner notes that put them in their proper context. Stretching from 1978, when Griffith was a budding folk revivalist with a penchant for sparse arrangements, to 1986, when she had blossomed into a confident country bandleader with a short-story-writer's eye for evocative detail, "Working in Corners" charts the steady development of Griffith's resounding talent.

Whitney Houston, 'I Go to the Rock: The Gospel Music of Whitney Houston'
(Gaither Music Group/Arista/Legacy Recordings; CD, $ 13.99; DVD, $ 19.99; both $ 29.95)
"Do you like gospel music?" Whitney Houston asked an audience at the Yokohama Arena in Japan in January 1990, before launching into an ecstatic six-minute medley of the devotional standards "He" and "I Believe." This live recording is one of the six previously unreleased tracks featured on "I Go to the Rock," a career-spanning compilation that centers Houston's lifelong connection to gospel music. (A concurrently released DVD provides additional commentary.) The set features several familiar tracks from the 1996 soundtrack of "The Preacher's Wife" -- still the best-selling gospel album of all time -- and two never-before-released performances from Houston's 1995 "VH1 Honors" concert, including a rousing duet of "Bridge Over Troubled Water" with CeCe Winans. But the album's most precious gem is "Testimony," an upbeat, foot-stomping song Houston recorded in 1981, when she was just 17. Her voice, fascinatingly, was still unformed compared to the immaculate instrument she'd soon learn how to command, but, as ever, it was alive with passion and spirit. ZOLADZ
Joni Mitchell, 'Archives, Vol. 3: The Asylum Years (1972-1975)'
(Rhino; five CDs, $ 69.98; four LPS, $ 99.98)
For Joni Mitchell, the period from 1972 and 1975 was a time of personal transformation and creative metamorphosis. The three exquisite, wildly different studio albums she released in that era -- the solitary meditation "For the Roses," the lively and openhearted "Court and Spark," the searchingly experimental "Hissing of Summer Lawns" -- tell the broad arc of the story, but this crucial and expansive boxed set fills in the details. Highlights include jam sessions with James Taylor and Neil Young (whose weeping guitar licks and harmonica turn the playful "You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio" into something else entirely); a crystalline 1972 Carnegie Hall show and a more rollicking 1974 set at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles; and early demos of future Mitchell classics like "Help Me," "Lesson in Survival" and "The Jungle Line." Across nearly six hours of chronologically arranged material, Mitchell's music steadily cuts its own winding path from poetic folk toward pop-minded jazz, anticipating her late-70s work with Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius and Charles Mingus. These years represent rapid growth, and this set provides an intimate look at Mitchell's process -- a rare opportunity to listen in as she perfects some of her most daring and enduring work. ZOLADZ
Chalino Sánchez, '15 Éxitos 15'
(Musart/Craft; two LPs, $ 50)
Chalino Sánchez was a singer of narcocorridos -- tales of the drug trade -- and also of deeply romantic and anguished ballads. He was killed in 1992 at age 31, and for all his success during his lifetime, death amplified his legend, ensuring that his elegantly sung songs and take-no-guff persona became a crucial part of the foundation for the Mexican and Mexican American music that arrived in his wake. In spirit, and sometimes in sound, Sánchez is one of the key precursors to the corridos tumbados movement that's currently taking traditional Mexican music worldwide. This is the first time this anthology of songs recorded throughout his career -- originally released in 1995, three years after Sánchez was killed -- has appeared on vinyl, in an exclusive from Vinyl Me, Please. It is a blistering showcase of his wide and expressive voice, whether on the deeply sad "Nieves de Enero" and "Alma Enamorada," or on the pride-filled tribute "A Todo Sinaloa." CARAMANICA
Various Artists, 'The Memphis Blues Box: Original Recordings First Released on 78s and 45s, 1914-1969'
(Bear Family; 20 CDs and 360-page hardcover book, $ 283)
This monumental collection -- 534 well-chosen songs with an encyclopedic book -- covers more than half a century of blues recorded in Memphis, with performers both well-known (B.B. King, Furry Lewis, Memphis Minnie, Elvis Presley, Ike and Tina Turner) and barely remembered. There were some constants through the decades: songs about loving, cheating, drinking, hard work and hard times. But the set also chronicles a genre solidifying and defining itself, as the variety of the 1920s and 1930s -- with jug bands, string bands, jazz combos, barrelhouse piano, kazoos and clarinets -- narrows into guitar-centered 12-bar shuffles and boogies, all sung with striking voices and wry resilience.

Various Artists, 'Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night: Brooklyn Disco 1974-5'
(Ace; one CD, $ 15; two LPs, $ 34)
Tony Manero would have never sashayed his way through Bay Ridge in "Saturday Night Fever" without the highly theatrical, occasionally lurid 1976 New York magazine article, written by Nik Cohn, about the emergent proto-disco nightclubs in Brooklyn. This compilation (which shares its name with that article) is an approximation of what was playing in those outer-borough rooms -- highly sensual, up-tempo soul music pulsing with lustrous string sections and singing that blended ache with pride. "After You've Had Your Fling (Get Down to the Real Thing)," by the Intrepids, begins as a taunt and ends in a pool of ecstasy. "Wake Up Everybody," by Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, is dynamic but not quite explosive, regal but not quite rocking. In total, these songs capture a moment before the disco sound coalesced into something shimmery and a touch saccharine, underscoring its foundation as thrilling, swelling music to sweat to. (Brief excerpts from Cohn's article are sprinkled throughout the liner notes, but a full reprint would have been welcome, even though the copy concedes the piece "was sold as fact but was fictional.")

Various Artists, 'Written in Their Soul: The Stax Songwriter Demos'
(Craft; seven CDs, $ 90; digital download, $ 70)
Songs have to start somewhere. East/Memphis Music, the publishing arm of Stax Records, kept copies of hundreds of demos from the 1960s and 1970s: solo home recordings and tracks roughed out with Stax studio stalwarts, hi-fi and lo-fi, chosen to become singles or left on the shelf. This set gathers 146 of them: some that clearly mapped the finished versions, some that would be recast and some that hold tantalizing unrealized possibilities. It's a chance to hear the voices of songwriters who largely stayed behind the scenes, like Bettye Crutcher, Homer Banks and Mack Rice. It's also a tribute to the Stax studio teamwork that would go on to punch up these demos into finished songs. PARELES
War, 'The World Is a Ghetto: 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition -- The Complete Sessions'
(Rhino; five LPs, $ 125)
The long-running Los Angeles band War came up with hybrid grooves -- funk-Latin-blues-rock-gospel-reggae-soul -- that sounded as casual as block-party jam sessions. But they weren't. War's 1972 album, "The World Is a Ghetto," went to No. 1 with hits built on those grooves, including "Low Rider" and "The Cisco Kid." The expanded reissue includes an LP of outtakes and, for each of its six songs, a 25-minute montage of session material. The songs take shape as the band chooses sounds, toys with riffs and rhythms, reworks lyrics and tightens up every syncopation; they're jovial, but they're doing the work. PARELES
The Who, 'Who's Next/Life House'
(Geffen; 10 CDs, 1 Blu-ray audio, 100-page hardcover book, $ 300)
Pete Townshend had vast ambitions for the Who's studio follow-up to the rock opera "Tommy," but cooler heads prevailed and it was cut back to a concept-free single album: "Who's Next," a pinnacle of the band's career. In 1970, long before the internet, Townshend envisioned "Life House" as a high-tech parable about ecological disaster, tyranny, virtual entertainment and the healing communal power of live rock music, which he wanted to generate with crowdsourced information from concert workshops. He also leaped into early synthesizer technology. Townshend never quite let go of "Life House"; he has released parts of it on solo collections, and this year he also collaborated on turning its story into a graphic novel. This exhaustive boxed set unites "Who's Next" with the whole painstaking process before it: demos, instrumentals, discarded songs with elements that would resurface elsewhere, variations and ferocious live workshop concerts at small theaters, along with spatialized Blu-ray remixes. It's a deep dive into Townshend's intense, convoluted creative efforts. The extended instrumental versions of the electronics-driven "Baba O'Riley" are spectacular; so is the live, muscular and metaphysical "Time Is Passing." PARELES

California Is Pushing E.V.s As the Future of Freight: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Neri Diaz thought he was ready for a crucial juncture in California's ambitious plans, closely watched in other states and around the world, to phase out diesel-powered trucks.
His company, Harbor Pride Logistics, acquired 14 electric trucks this year to work alongside 32 diesel vehicles, in anticipation of a rule that says diesel rigs can no longer be added to the list of vehicles approved to move goods in and out of California's ports. But in August the manufacturer of Mr. Diaz's electric vehicles, Nikola, took back the trucks as part of a recall, saying it would return them in the first quarter of the new year.
"It's a brand-new technology, first generation, so I knew things were going to happen, but I wasn't expecting all my 14 trucks to be taken back," he said. "It is a big impact on my operations."
The rule was to take effect at the start of the new year, but California's Air Resources Board said on Thursday that it would not begin enforcement until it had received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Trucking, an outsize source of carbon emissions, is where California's green revolution is meeting some of its biggest challenges. Electric trucks, with their huge batteries, can cost over $ 400,000, and they can't do long hauls without stopping for long charging periods, which can undermine the economics of a trucking fleet.
But California sees the port trucks as an opportunity to take a big step forward.
The electric trucks on the market today can travel from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach -- the nation's busiest hub for container cargo -- to many of the warehouses inland without stopping to charge. And cleaning up the port trucks could have a big impact. With some 30,000 trucks registered with the ports, introducing green vehicles could lead to a substantial decrease in carbon emissions and the particulates that can cause illnesses in the communities through which the trucks travel.
Nancy Gonzalez and her 25-year-old son, Juan, who has Down syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, live in the Wilmington neighborhood, just north of the ports. Huge rigs going to and from nearby truck yards roar constantly a few feet from the house.
The truck traffic got much heavier about four years ago, Ms. Gonzalez said, and now she cleans twice a day to get rid of the dirt it produces. Ms. Gonzalez says that she has problems with her sinuses and that her son's eyes started tearing about two years ago.
"Nobody opens their windows," she said in Spanish through an interpreter. "Nobody."
California hopes that its stringent rules combined with financial support -- truck purchase grants from state agencies can total as much as $ 288,000 per vehicle, operators say -- will help spur truckers, automakers, warehouse landlords, utilities and charging companies to make the investments needed to create a carbon-free port truck sector by 2035, when all diesel trucks will be banned from the ports. And success at the ports could help the state meet its goal of decarbonizing all types of trucking over the next two decades, and be a model for similar efforts in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington.
"In the long run, I am quite confident we can decarbonize the heavy-duty truck sector," said James Sallee, a professor in the department of agriculture and resource economics at the University of California, Berkeley, referring to California's plan. "But I don't know that the industry is ready to overcome the various barriers to rapid deployment."
The port fleets have barely started the transformation.
In November, 180 electric trucks, a mere 1 percent of the total, were registered to operate at the Port of Los Angeles. There was a single truck powered by hydrogen fuel cells, the other technology used to power big rigs.
Some truck operators say they have stockpiled diesel trucks and registered them with the ports ahead of the new rule, though this does not show up in port statistics. In November, there were 20,083 diesel trucks with access to the Los Angeles port, down from 21,310 a year earlier.
Large companies, with deep pockets and big facilities, are best positioned to make the green transition. Mike Gallagher, a California-based executive at Maersk, the Danish shipping giant, said the company had a fully electric fleet, comprising some 85 vehicles made by Volvo and BYD, the Chinese automaker, for transporting goods up to 50 miles out of the ports of Southern California. And it has worked with landlords to install scores of chargers at its depots.
"We're well ahead of the curve," he said.
But smaller trucking fleets do most of the port runs -- accounting for some 70 percent at the Los Angeles port -- and they are going to find the transition hard. The California Trucking Association has filed a federal lawsuit against the state's trucking rules, including the one focused on port trucks, contending that they represent "a vast overreach that threatens the security and predictability of the nation's goods movement industry."
Matt Schrap, the chief executive of the Harbor Trucking Association, another trade group, said the port truck rules lacked exemptions that would help smaller businesses survive the transformation. Getting access to chargers is particularly difficult for smaller fleets, he said: They are expensive, and the truck yard landlords may be reluctant to install them, forcing the operators to rely on a public charging system that is only just getting built.
"The landlord is, like, 'There's not a snowball's chance in Bakersfield that you're going to tear up my parking lot to put in some heavy-duty charging,"' Mr. Schrap said.
Concern exists beyond the trade groups. Mr. Gallagher, the Maersk executive, said that if the clean truck rules caused serious problems for smaller operators, it could be "a significant disruption to the supply chain."
Forum Mobility is one of several companies that believe they can help the smaller fleets, by building public truck charging stations and leasing electric trucks. The company has secured permits to build a depot at the Long Beach port, expected to open next year, that can charge 44 trucks. The depot will run on nine megawatts of electricity, enough to power most sports stadiums, but Forum Mobility executives say that charging all the port trucks would require roughly the amount of power produced by Diablo Canyon, a California nuclear power station, and thousands of chargers.
"We need a real Manhattan Project on interconnection," said Adam Browning, executive vice president for policy at Forum Mobility.
Chanel Parson, director of building and transportation electrification at Southern California Edison, a large power utility, said building out the truck-charging infrastructure would be helped if state agencies streamlined the issuing of permits and accelerated spending approvals, and if trucking companies communicated their charging needs.
But she added that her company was undaunted by the task. "There's not this concern that this is really difficult," she said. "It's what we do."
Mr. Diaz, the operator whose Nikola trucks were recalled, said that charging the trucks cost roughly 40 percent less than diesel, and that he was impressed with their performance. Even with the help of state grants, he estimates that the electric trucks cost him as much as 50 percent more than diesel models. During the recall, Nikola has been covering the payments on the loans Mr. Diaz took out to buy the trucks, but he said he was concerned about the truck maker's financial situation.
Steve Girsky, Nikola's chief executive, said a new infusion of capital in December showed that investors believed in the company. "This will get us a long way," he said in an interview. "Everything this company's talked about is coming together in the fourth quarter."
Some trucking executives say not only that they are used to responding to California's ratcheting up of regulations over the years, but also that they believe in the environmental goals of the port truck transition.
Rudy Diaz, president of Hight Logistics, said the new regulations had pushed up some of his costs as his company brought drivers onto its payroll and reduced its reliance on contract drivers using their own diesel trucks.
"It's extra headaches, extra costs," he said. "But consumers are asking for products that are more sustainable, and they're willing to pay the price."

Full text: It's fashionable to look down on the famous Honolulu beach as touristy and inauthentic. But you can still find the tropical paradise that inspired dreams of the islands, if you know where to look.
Since my first trip to Waikiki Beach in 1977, I have traveled all around the Hawaiian Islands. And I've loved each one. But I love Waikiki, too.
Not the hordes of tourists, of course, or the high-end shopping malls that have taken over Kalākaua Avenue and earned it the nickname, Vegas on the Beach. What I love are the remnants of a different Waikiki, a beautiful, tropical paradise that inspired songs and movies and dreams and romance. When I come here, with some time and patience, I can still find that Waikiki.
Lately, it's become fashionable to dismiss Waikiki as a playland for tourists and not the "real" Hawaii. When I posted pictures of a gorgeous sunset and the waves crashing on Waikiki Beach on social media last March, I got vehement comments like: "Get out of there and see the real Hawaii!"
And: "Here's where you should be ..."
And: "Ugh. Waikiki."
But Waikiki is no less the real Hawaii than anywhere else, said T. Ilihia Gionson, the public affairs officer for the Hawaii Tourism Authority. "From the beginning, Waikiki has been a very special place that captured the hearts and souls of many," he said. "The land is the land, and it will always have that certain energy and life force that comes through, no matter what we put upon it."
According to Mr. Gionson, in prepandemic 2019, Hawaii had 10.4 million annual arrivals, its highest number ever. Numbers this year are running at about 92 percent of that number, or close to 10 million arrivals. The strain of so many visitors on local neighborhoods led the Hawaiian Tourism Authority to ask themselves how they can do tourism better and reinvest economic resources into communities and resources. With its emphasis on local culture, traditions and products, the Mālama Hawaii campaign, which kicked off in 2021, invites travelers to learn how Hawaiians care for their home.
Waikiki, once home to royalty, was an agricultural center, rich with taro fields and rice paddies, and eventually became a seaside neighborhood for local families. The Māhele, a land distribution plan that changed the islands' communal system of land ownership to a private one in 1848, brought western land barons and the beginning of tourism with hotels built for wealthy tourists.
With the opening of the luxurious Moana Surfrider in 1901, Waikiki's reputation as a popular tourist destination began. Promoters advertised many of the things that are still synonymous with Waikiki today -- lū'aus, lush leis, and the beach boys who taught water sports. Wealthy businessmen watched crowds emerge from boats onto Waikiki Beach after a six-and-a-half day trip from San Francisco and saw an opportunity to develop these wetlands into a tourist mecca. The Waikiki Reclamation Project drained and dredged Ala Wai Canal and its surrounding fish ponds, taro fields, rice farms and banana and coconut groves, then filled them with material upon which to build hundreds of acres of new hotels and upscale homes.
Old Waikiki was gone -- again -- and a new Waikiki of luxury hotels and tiki bars emerged. Movies like "Blue Hawaii," starring Elvis Presley, and singers like Don Ho brought Hawaii into our living rooms. This was the Waikiki I arrived in on a United Airlines Friend Ship, one of 3 million tourists who visited in 1977. As my friends and I disembarked from our flight, where stewardesses in flowered uniforms served us mai tais and macadamia-crusted chicken, saronged women placed plumeria leis around our necks and welcomed us with that magical word, "Aloha."
Unable to afford a beachfront hotel, we stayed at the Miramar, four blocks from the ocean. But we didn't care -- we were in Waikiki. We bought tatami mats and Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion at the ABC store and happily walked across the street, through the lobby of a hotel and onto the beach. There was Diamond Head, and surfers and the Pacific Ocean, everything we had hoped for.
When we weren't sunbathing, we roamed around the International Marketplace, the outdoor market that Don the Beachcomber, the father of tiki culture, opened in 1956, the year we were born. Around the 60-foot-tall banyan tree in the center were kiosks that sold all things tropical and Hawaiian. Jane paid $ 10 for the chance to find an oyster with a pearl inside. I bought my mother a handwoven grass skirt. Why I thought a middle-aged accountant in West Warwick, R.I., would want a grass skirt, I can't say. Except that I was bringing Hawaii, a place she would never visit, 5,000 miles to her.
At night, we ate teriyaki sirloins at Chuck's Cellar and drank overly sweet mai tais at beach bars. In the morning, we ordered all-you-can-eat pancakes at Wailana Coffee House, tucked our tatami mats under our arms, and started all over again.
The Miramar Hotel, Chuck's Cellar, and the Wailana Coffee House are all gone now. The International Marketplace was completely razed in 2013 and reopened three years later with only the name and the banyan tree remaining. Today, instead of the dangling vines and footbridges, the International Marketplace is a three-story mall with a Burberry shop and a Christian Louboutin.
In many ways, what happened to the International Marketplace represents what has happened to create this newest Waikiki. With an influx of international tourists in the 1990s, high-end retail shops arrived along with more hotels. The well-known San Francisco department store Gump's, which opened at the corner of Kalākaua Avenue and Lewers Street in 1929, became a Louis Vuitton store in 1992. Thirteen years later, buildings were bulldozed or repurposed to create Luxury Row with stores like Chanel and Gucci.
When I asked the Island-born chef and restaurateur, Ed Kenney, where I could find old Waikiki, his first response was that unfortunately, that Waikiki has been all but lost. Then he gave me recommendations of where to find it.
One way to get there is to walk through a different mall, past the Wolfgang Puck steakhouse and the word Aloha surrounded by lights, until you see a flash of pink through the trees. Follow that pink through a wrought-iron gate into an oasis of grass and trees and the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, called the Pink Palace of the Pacific when it opened in 1927. Immediately, the crowds and noise disappear. Minutes after you check in, you will be under a pink-and-white striped beach umbrella, your toes in white sand. Wander over to the bar for a mai tai, commissioned as a special cocktail for this very hotel and created by Victor Bergeron in 1953, and it is like being back in time.
At sunset, I like to go to the restaurant House Without a Key to sip a pretty pink Table 97 cocktail while the Kapalama Trio sings softly beneath a 136-year-old kiawe tree and the sky turns pink and lavender. The cocktail is named for Ernest Hemingway and Martha Gellhorn's favorite table when they honeymooned here in 1940, and the restaurant is named for the 1925 novel, "The House Without a Key," by Earl Derr Biggers, which was the first of a mystery series featuring a fictional Honolulu detective named Charlie Chan. An original copy is on display at the entrance.
It is also worth it to brave the throngs and take a walk down Kalākaua Avenue, past some of the remaining old significant Waikiki architecture. Although most of the iconic buildings were torn down, a surprising number of hidden gems with tropical-motif latticework railings and building decorations remain. Start at the Waikiki Galleria Tower at 2222 Kalākaua Avenue, built in 1966 by the architect George Wimberly, then continue around the corner for a 10-minute walk to see the breadfruit design on the wrought iron railings at the Kaiulani Court Apartments at 209 Kaiulani Avenue.
Nearby apartment buildings along Lau'ula Street have railings with surfboards, banana leaves and sails, as well as lava rock walls and cantilevered lanais. Even the new International Marketplace is worth a visit to see that old banyan tree and a replica of Don the Beachcomber's office with old photographs, menus and advertisements in a treehouse above it.
Skip the lines at the Cheesecake Factory and take a short Uber ride to the Highway Inn, open since 1947, for some lau lau and kalua pig with cabbage and a 25-cent side of raw onion with salt. Or try the Side Street Inn for fried rice, garlic fried chicken and sizzling short ribs. Or have an iconic plate lunch of loco moco, rice and macaroni salad at the Rainbow Drive-in, open since 1961 and affectionately called Rainbows by locals.
Except for the happy hour at the piano bar at the Moana Surfrider, where they make strong real cocktails like martinis and Manhattans, skip the Blue Hawaiis and sugary mai tais at hotel bars. Instead, walk down Saratoga Road, past the tattoo parlor and Eggs and Things (serving eggs with Portuguese sausage or pork chops since 1974) to Arnold's Beach Bar, a tiny bar that is actually not on the beach, but is full of regulars, like a Waikiki Cheers. If you're lucky, Brie Brundige will be behind the bar making Arnold's famous mai tais ( $ 10 here versus $ 21 or more in hotels) and will share the recipe.
One morning, I woke up early, got a kona coffee and a li hing mango morning bun from the Honolulu Café, and sat on Waikiki Beach. It was quiet and, except for some surfers in the water and a mother and daughter building sand castles, I was alone. The sky was pale pink. The palm trees swayed in the breeze. Diamond Head watched me sitting there. I was smiling, happy in Waikiki. It is still there, if you look hard enough.

Using Middlemen, Russia Evades Sanctions on Imported Technology: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, engineers at Convex, a Russian telecommunications company, needed to find American equipment to transmit data to the country's feared intelligence service. But no gear was flowing in after Western nations imposed sweeping new trade limits on Russia.
Convex's employees soon found a solution.
While Cisco, a U.S. tech provider, had halted sales to Russia on March 3, 2022, Convex's engineers easily obtained the Cisco gear they needed through an obscure Russian e-commerce site called Nag, which had gotten around international trade restrictions by buying the American equipment through a web of suppliers in China.
Convex engineers then visited the offices of Russia's Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., in Yekaterinburg to install the gear that would help categorize and send data to the authorities. "Coordinate with the F.S.B. the placement of the Cisco Catalyst WS-C4948E switch," a Convex engineer wrote on March 23, 2022, according to a company communications log obtained by The New York Times.
In the 22 months since the war in Ukraine began, Russia has largely continued getting the technology it needs to keep its economy running. After export restrictions and corporate bans initially led to trade disruptions, Russian suppliers found loopholes and cultivated workarounds. Almost no piece of commercial hardware -- including basic telecom equipment, surveillance gear, microchips for advanced computing and weapons systems, and drones -- has been too hard to get.
Russian authorities and companies have united to take advantage of cracks in the global response. They have tapped webs of intermediaries, including middlemen in China, and disguised their activity through shell companies, according to leaked Russian government emails, trade documents and records of online conversations between Russian engineers obtained by The Times.
They have also turned to countries that have staked out neutral positions in the conflict, such as Morocco and Turkey, and used their ports to receive goods from global tech manufacturing centers that are then placed on other ships headed toward Russia, a process known as transshipment. The prohibited tech products were then made available to buy from well-known suppliers and on easy-to-use e-commerce sites like Nag.
Flexibility has been paramount. In weekly emails, Russian trade officials shared tips on which ports would transfer goods, who would trade in rubles and where Russian-flagged ships could be repaired, the documents show. If one supplier stopped selling, they found another. If a shipping route was cut off, new ones took up the slack.
The documents offer a rare glimpse of a race in which Russian traders have reliably stayed one step ahead of U.S.-led efforts to cut them off. Their success shows how difficult it is to stop the global movement of commercial technology, raising questions about the effectiveness of Western trade restrictions and whether tech giants should better control the destinations of their products -- and if it is even possible to do so.
Cisco declined to comment. Convex did not respond to requests for comment.
Understaffed government investigators in the United States and Europe cannot keep pace with the often shadowy flow of goods, said Elina Ribakova, an economist who has studied sanctions evasion at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a U.S. think tank. Major tech companies, she added, must do more to cut off supplies to Russia.
"It's an endless Whac-a-Mole game," she said. "There should be alarm, particularly among the policymakers, that we have announced a lot of sanctions and may believe they are working but in reality they are not."
A Beautiful Friendship
As sanctions against Russia took effect last year, ProSoft, a Moscow-based electronics provider, experienced the fallout.
Officials at the company, which sells biometric surveillance equipment and tech for heavy industry and critical infrastructure, emailed the Russian government trade mission in Morocco for help, according to a message reviewed by The Times.
"Just a week ago, it was not difficult to ship them to us from American and European suppliers," a ProSoft executive wrote, referring to now-banned tech. Now "we run the risk of starting to reduce production (there are small reserves in the warehouse)."
A spreadsheet attached to the message listed hundreds of American, European and Japanese microchips and sensors that ProSoft needed.
At the time, Russia's economy was absorbing the initial effects of trade restrictions. The ruble tumbled, inflation and interest rates soared, Russian banks were cut off from large swaths of the global financial system and oligarchs sat helpless as their yachts were seized.
But the pain did not last as President Vladimir V. Putin remade Russia's economy. Russian officials and executives swiftly teamed up to find workarounds. Political loyalists profited as Western companies fled.
In Morocco, Russia's trade office, which looks after the country's economic interests overseas, also helped Russian companies regain their footing. After ProSoft reached out for help, trade officials jumped into action.
"We're in constant contact with the general director" of Morocco's state-run port of Tanger Med, one Russian official wrote in an April 2022 email. "In the event of ships entering under the Russian flag, there will be no problems with maintenance."
A spokeswoman for Tanger Med, which hugs the Strait of Gibraltar, said the port leased space to shipping companies and had "no information nor responsibility" about vessels moving through the complex. The port, which handles more than eight million containers annually connecting to 180 international ports, was "not aware" of shipped goods calling at Russian ports before or after being at Tanger Med, or maintenance of Russian ships being performed, she added.
By November 2022, Russian trade officials in Morocco were bragging that their "direct support" had turned the African country into an electronics transshipment hub. Goods from Taiwan, China and other manufacturing centers were offloaded at Tanger Med and then placed on other ships headed to Russia.
"Given the long-term nature of the cooperation with the Moroccan partner, the volume of supplies could amount to about $ 10 million per year," the trade officials wrote about their work for ProSoft.
ProSoft also maintained supplies of Western tech with the help of an obscure scrap metal company registered in Casablanca, Morocco. After the war began, the company, Invent Maroc, set up a new website and routed restricted technology through Morocco to Russia, including microchips from Texas Instruments, Intel and NXP, according to trade data. In 2022, the United States had limited the export of semiconductors made with American equipment or intellectual property to Russia.
Invent Maroc, run by a man named Alexander Trinz, had no prior history of international exports. Yet it sourced electronics from Costa Rica, Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Japan and Mexico, according to trade records.
In a call this month, Mr. Trinz said he had supplied technology to Russia in the past, but not since the war. "Before, we worked with Russia, but in this moment we can't," he said.
An analysis of ProSoft's offerings found nearly 300 products for sale that contain Intel chips, as well as components made by Nvidia and an A.I. optimized computer chip designed by Google. Although it is unclear how the imports were ultimately used, American chips have been found on Russian missiles and drones, according to weapons experts.
Nvidia, Intel and Google declined to comment. Texas Instruments said it opposed "the illicit diversion of our products to Russia." ProSoft, NXP and Russia's trade representative to Morocco did not respond to requests for comment.
In October 2022, Russian trade officials said they had established 20 operators at the Tanger Med port to "promptly carry out" the logistics of getting cargo loaded onto "feeder" vessels ultimately bound for Russia, according to a weekly shipping report. Another report noted that ports in Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, had accepted payment in rubles.
"The sanctions restrictions have been successfully overcome," one government report said of a Turkish trade route this March.
Click and Buy
On little-known Russian e-commerce sites like Nag, OCS Distribution, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom, complex technologies made by major American and European telecom manufacturers, such as Cisco, HP, Juniper, Ericsson and Nokia, are listed for sale.
Many of these sites freely sold Western technology for decades, but overhauled their supply chains because of the war. Since then, the platforms have received hundreds of millions of dollars in technology from China, according to trade records.
China and Hong Kong supplied 85 percent of semiconductors imported to Russia from March 2022 to September 2023, up from 27 percent before the conflict, according to the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a nonprofit that studies Russian trade routes.
Nag, which sells hardware to regional telecoms and surveillance contractors, is one major platform. Through intermediaries, it has bought roughly $ 100 million in restricted American tech since the war began, according to trade data. In total, it imported $ 150 million in hardware from China this year, the data show. Communications gear, which has ostensibly been prohibited from reaching Russia, is readily available on its site, filtered by price, product type and quantity.
Nag employees have talked about logistical challenges that international sanctions have caused, according to internal communications. In May 2022, a Nag employee wrote to a Russian customer that "the old transit system has ended," delaying delivery of $ 20,000 of Juniper equipment. A month later, Nag followed up to say that the problem had been resolved and that the gear would arrive in the coming months.
Tech for building online surveillance and censorship was also available. Russian telecom operators are required by law to provide communications data about customers to the security services, meaning they must buy specialized equipment that sends the information to government agents. On Nag message boards, now accessible only from within Russia, engineers posted technical tips for making the systems work to F.S.B. specs.
Ericsson, Juniper, Nokia and IBM said any imports into Russia were done without their consent. OCS Distribution said that it "does not sell products in violation of international sanctions and restrictions" and that any such tech listed on its website for purchase was there because it was in the midst of an overhaul. HP, 3Logic Distribution and 4Telecom did not respond to requests for comment.
A network of Nag-operated companies and brands in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and the United Arab Emirates has also helped obscure shipments of sanctioned technology. In total, Nag brought in almost $ 10 million in Cisco equipment and about $ 1 million in Nokia and Intel products to Russia over the past year.
At the F.S.B. offices in Yekaterinburg, the Cisco gear that Convex engineers installed sat alongside routers made by Juniper, according to Convex's records. Less than a year later, the availability of Western tech was so abundant that Convex's engineers could shop around.
In a conversation on Convex's internal messaging system this year, engineers focused on a new supplier that they had "spotted." Operating under the name sale-server.ru, the supplier had plenty of restricted name-brand technology from HP, IBM and others. More important, the price was right.
"Cheaper than Nag," one Convex employee wrote.

Behind the Culinary Magic of Cookie Week: [briefing]

Full text: A behind-the-scenes guide to Cookie Week.
Hi, everyone! I'm Vaughn, a supervising video producer for New York Times Cooking. And today, we're talking all about cookies. Specifically, what separates the humdrum from the ho-ho-ho, the blasé from the trailblazing, the "just fine" from the "those were the best I've ever had."
For the past four years, I, along with my colleagues at NYT Cooking, have put together our favorite holiday cookies for a tradition we call "Cookie Week." It started as a sort of YouTube cookie swap amid the pandemic -- the brainchild of a small but mighty video team, featuring seven Cooking personalities baking up magic over the course of seven days, all shot by the talent themselves, in their homes. It's now become a full-on multiverse, complete with a stunning spread in the paper of record, daily videos, a newsletter, live events and the most delightful and dazzling cookies the New York Times Cooking team could muster.
(We tried to get Mariah but she was too expensive.)
Over these four years, I've learned a lot about what types of treats folks find outstanding during the holidays. They love twists on nostalgic classics, unexpected flavor combinations and eye-catching decoration. This year, we sought cookies that hit all those marks and beautifully balance each other in a box: electric colors alongside warm, rich tones; citrusy, chocolaty and earthy flavors; a variety of textures, shapes and sizes. With chewy gingerbread blondies, buttery lemon swoops and spicy hot chocolate crinkles (to name a few), I firmly believe there's something for everyone in this batch.
Above are the seven developers (including myself!) behind all the magic. Eric, whose holiday cookies are as nostalgic as they are evocative; Melissa, whom many consider to be the GOAT (her gingerbread blondies do not disprove that); Sue, whose precise technique and gorgeous flavors always shine; Samantha, who not only developed her own showstopper but also styled all of the cookies for the photo shoot; me, who [insert something nice about Vaughn here]; Yewande, whose cookies are always as stylish as they are brimming with flavor; and Sohla, who has more fun in the kitchen than anyone I've ever met and is a baking genius.
Though I supervise the video team, I also develop recipes and appear on camera, so I'm in on Cookie Week from the ground floor up. I get asked a lot of questions about the process behind it all: When do we start? What is the brainstorming process like? How do you come up with the ideas?
Here are some demystifying facts and figures: Every July we start throwing around ideas (begrudgingly, because it's still summer and we don't want to think about the holidays yet). We then approach our Cookie Week squad with a request for four or five ideas each, and from there our editors narrow the list to one that exhibits every cookie quality we look for. It takes weeks of working and reworking, going back for more pitches, and helping the developers to get their cookies just right. I have fond memories of testing out different icing techniques one day in our cooking studio with my pal Samantha, until finally landing on one that felt glamorous and vibrant, yet completely doable for home bakers.
To me, that's the best part about Cookie Week: the rewarding feeling I get when I see people making them all over the world, reaching out to ask me a question or tell me how much their family loved my cookies, or simply commenting on the YouTube video that they can't wait to try them. Cookie Week is first and foremost about joy -- about getting in the kitchen and expressing your love through food.

TALK | FROM THE TIMES MAGAZINE
I spoke with the ever-restless, ever-inquisitive musician David Byrne about curiosity and enchantment.
Do you think curiosity can be cultivated? Or are some people just more curious than others?
I think you can develop a willingness to try new things, but curiosity is kind of self-motivated. I sense that for many people, they love the feeling of the familiar and the secure and a place where the answers are. Whether the answers are through religion or their political affiliation or family, there's a security that comes with that, and that would imply maybe a lack of willingness to be curious and go outside that zone. I've been reading about the pre-Enlightenment.
Oh!
Which showed a similar kind of thing in some ways. Religion and other things provided all the answers. Then science comes along, and you maintain the how, but the why is now left behind. Max Weber talks about the great disenchantment. That's when everything in the world seems enchanted, and it's filled with a kind of spiritual power and then as science and everything starts to take over, things don't have that magical aura anymore.
Do you feel enchantment about the world?
I feel that. I think a lot of people in the sciences feel that, too. They feel that the way things work in physics or biology or whatever it might be is still kind of marvelous. Even though they're not just saying God or the gods made it this way, it's still moving and amazing. And this idea of ecology, our awareness of the network or web of connections in physics and nature and biology, there's a sense of wonder in that connection. It's not quite religious, but it is amazing.

Full text: The French fashion house took its Métiers d'Art show to the north of England and the home of soccer, Coronation Street and Northern soul.
Manchester is a city of glory and grit. Set among the damp northwest hills of England, it's the rain-spattered home of Northern soul and legendary bands like Joy Division, New Order and Oasis; two world famous soccer clubs; the cradle of the industrial revolution; and one of the most vibrant nightlife scenes on the planet. Style and swagger? This proud city has them in spades. But most people would not consider it a capital of high fashion.
That all changed this week when Chanel took over the town for its Métiers d'Art runway show, an annual presentation of the intricate craftsmanship of its specialist ateliers. Since 2002, the show has been held in Salzburg, Austria; Rome; and Dakar, Senegal, among other cities. On Thursday, 600 guests, braving icy winds and lashing rain, descended on the Northern Quarter neighborhood of Manchester for a runway show held on Thomas Street, lined with empty tattoo parlors, pubs, vintage clothing stores and record shops. (Their owners had been paid off handsomely to vacate them for the week.) As guests took their seats by candlelight on the street among A-listers like Kristen Stewart, Tilda Swinton and Hugh Grant -- under a giant purpose-built Perspex roof -- many sipped hot toddies to fortify themselves against the elements.
The show may not have had the glamour and grandeur of those at past Chanel sites. (Some eyebrows were raised when the location was announced earlier this year.) But the beauty of Manchester is not to be found in its gloomy buildings, many of which housed a once thriving textile and cotton trade. Rather, it is in the electric spirit and creativity that pulsates through the narrow streets of the city.
"We wanted this show to take place in England, but not in London, which felt too expected," the Chanel president, Bruno Pavlovsky, said before the show. Twenty-four hours earlier, guests had been treated to a raucous night in the stands at Old Trafford as they watched Manchester United beat Chelsea or to a recital at a local working men's club by the punk-rock-era poet John Cooper Clarke.
"Manchester has an incredible energy to its arts scene, its music and football culture, and ideas have been born here that have changed the world," Mr. Pavlovsky said. "That energy was incredibly inspiring to our creative director, Virginie Viard, and her vision for this collection."
Chanel loves to go to parts of the world that have ties to its founder, Coco Chanel. The family estate of the Duke of Westminster, her lover in the 1920s, was Eaton Hall in nearby Cheshire. Chanel worked on her designs there and would often drive to nearby factories to source cotton and velvet for her collections. The tweed jackets English aristocrats wore for outdoor pursuits, like shoots at Eaton Hall, would become a cornerstone of her fashion empire.
Tweed was also at the heart of the Chanel show that took place in Manchester this week, to a thumping soundtrack from the likes of Soft Cell, New Order and Cilla Black. (Someone should probably tell the organizers that Ms. Black is famous for being from Liverpool.)
The collection began with a modish hat tip to the 1960s and a series of smart tweed skirt suits in acid green, fuchsia, orange and yellow, some with matching baker boy caps and paired with Mary Janes. Then hemlines got shorter and out came the knitwear, all in coordinating intarsia patterns and prints and with chunky scarves tightly wound around the models' necks.
Since taking the creative helm of Chanel in 2019, Ms. Viard has been keen to bring a youthful verve to the house, often via a 1980s slant. That was here in outfits that paid tribute to New Wave club girls, with black denim and patent leather looks and sheer baby-doll dresses with bodices made from interlocking C's and graphic flourishes inspired by logos from the soccer stands.
A final series of more timeless sparkly minidresses closed the show -- a fitting tribute to the generations of barelegged Northern girls who have braved wintry streets in search of a good night out.
Any guests of that mindset were then taken in a fleet of limousines to an after-party at the Victoria Baths, home to Britain's finest historic swimming pool surrounded by stained glass windows and original Edwardian tiles. Inside, the band Primal Scream played a private set from the deep end of the pool (thankfully emptied of water) with music that went on until late, while scores of amused locals watched on from railings outside.
All of it was bags of fun, far more tongue-in-cheek than the usual fare from a French fashion house, and a spotlight on one of Britain's best-loved cities, which thoroughly deserves the attention and investment it reaped by the global fashion industry circus rolling into town. The designer Henry Holland summed it up best with his bold black and white poster commissioned for the event (most effective when imagined in a thick Northern accent): "Well well well -- if it isn't Manchester does Chanel."

The Cybersecurity Suit That's Riveting Boards: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Kessler, Sarah

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An S.E.C. lawsuit against a software company hacked by Russian state actors in 2020 could affect how companies handle cybersecurity risks.
For the last month, an under-the-radar lawsuit has privately been a hot topic of conversation in Fortune 500 boardrooms and corporate security departments.
In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued a software company hacked by Russian agents in 2020, accusing it of defrauding investors by not disclosing allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities.
The lawsuit named not just the company, SolarWinds, but also its chief information security officer, Timothy Brown. A year earlier, a former chief security officer at Uber, Joe Sullivan, was found guilty of failing to disclose a data breach to federal regulators. Executives heading up cybersecurity have a sense that their personal risk is increasing.
"I've been doing this for 25 years, and I've always been protecting others," said George Gerchow, the chief security officer and senior vice president of information technology at Sumo Logic, a software company. "Now, all of a sudden, I'm in a weird position where I'm having to protect myself."
Perhaps more alarming to boardrooms is that SolarWinds did disclose some cybersecurity risks -- in the same way that just about all public companies do.
"You can track it across a hundred different companies, that they're all basically using the exact same language," said Josephine Wolff, an associate professor of cybersecurity policy at Tufts University.
Now it seems the S.E.C. no longer considers those boilerplate disclosures to be sufficient if the company knows of more specific risks. The lawsuit is the first in which the S.E.C. has charged a company with intentional fraud related to cybersecurity disclosures, according to the law firm White & Case.
In his first interview since the S.E.C. complaint, the C.E.O. of SolarWinds, Sudhakar Ramakrishna, told DealBook that the company hadn't known about the issue that exposed it to the cyberattack in 2020, and that the lawsuit was "an attempt, we believe, by the S.E.C. to advance policy."
The lawsuit could "actually make CISOs more fearful, not more emboldened to raise their voice," he said.
Most experts agree that, regardless of the lawsuit's outcome, it could affect how companies handle cybersecurity risks. But they're divided over whether it will encourage better or worse practices.
The lawsuit is not the only sign the S.E.C. is paying attention to cybersecurity. In July, the agency adopted new cybersecurity disclosure requirements set to take effect in December. They require companies to report material attacks within four days and to make yearly disclosures about their cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. In a June speech, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director, Gurbir Grewal, said it had "zero tolerance for gamesmanship" around cybersecurity disclosures.
Some experts worry that the lawsuit could have a chilling effect. "There were some serious warning signs that he and his team had surfaced," Wolff said of the SolarWinds CISO. "And now that's being used against him specifically to say, 'You knew about this, you didn't disclose it in the S.E.C. filings.' Which I think really does create an incentive to never document or never find any vulnerabilities anywhere." That could make it difficult for the I.T. department to ask for money for cybersecurity, she said.
Ramakrishna, the SolarWinds C.E.O., said that being expected to disclose every potential security vulnerability could make it easier for attackers to abuse them. "For one, it'll be too many for the average investor to understand," he said. "For another, I think we'll be playing into the hands of the threat."
Others argue that the threat of S.E.C. action could empower executives in charge of cybersecurity. Jake Williams, a security expert who consults with companies when they've experienced a data breach, said he regularly saw CISOs being asked to "paint a rosy or maybe rosier-than-aligned-with-reality picture." But he added: "That practice, I think, died the day the SolarWinds lawsuit was filed by the agency. No CISO can now risk basically painting an unrealistically positive picture of cybersecurity."
Harley Geiger is a lawyer who specializes in cybersecurity at the law firm Venable and is part of the team representing a coalition of tech companies including Cisco, Broadcom, Microsoft and Google. He said there were ways for CISOs to react to increased personal risk other than avoiding documentation of concerns and recommendations, including by erring on the side of escalating risks and vulnerabilities.
"They may want to be covered by a company's insurance policy. They may want indemnification in their employment contracts," Geiger said. "I think it would be the wrong message for or the wrong takeaway for CISOs to choose to ignore or not escalate material cybersecurity information."
If generic disclosures aren't enough, what is? Being too specific about vulnerabilities could give attackers valuable information, while being too broad isn't valuable to investors. "The question," Wolff said, "is can the S.E.C. define a clear middle ground." -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
An inflation surprise ignites a market rally. The Consumer Price Index report released on Tuesday showed that inflation cooled last month more than analysts had expected, helped by a fall in energy prices. Investors cheered the news as a bevy of Wall Street economists concluded that the Federal Reserve was most likely done with raising interest rates.
Another Republican drops out of the presidential race. Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, suspended his campaign this week. He and the rest of the Republican field have trailed Donald Trump by double-digit margins for months. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, had a better week. She appeared to be close to winning over big conservative donors, including Ken Griffin of Citadel.
Trump's social media platform is struggling. Trump Media & Technology Group, the firm that runs Truth Social, has racked up big losses and may not survive without new funding, a regulatory filing this week disclosed. Truth Social has been pinning its future on a long-delayed merger with a shell company meant to take it public, giving it access to roughly $ 300 million in funding.
An A.I. pioneer on her life and science
When Fei-Fei Li, co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, showed the first draft of her book project to one of her colleagues, he told her to throw it away.
"He said that there's a lot of scientists who can write about the ideas of technology," Li told DealBook. But the colleague added that "my unique personal journey, as an immigrant, as a woman, as someone whose coming-of-age as a scientist is so intertwined with the coming-of-age of modern A.I., would give even those who are not traditionally in the world of tech a voice to identify with."
Li persevered, and the book, "The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration, and Discovery at the Dawn of AI," was published this month, telling the story of the growth of A.I. and her own story as an immigrant from China who became one of the world's leading experts in the field.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
What should a business leader take away from your book?
There's so much debate and confusion and, frankly, anxiety around A.I. Part of the anxiety comes from not knowing what it is. Part of it comes from not knowing what it's going to do. I hope this book sort of dispels both.
Tools are made by humans, designed by humans, used by humans. We have responsibilities as well as agency.
You write about the complex consequences of commercial investment in A.I. Can you tell me more about that?
At the beginning of my career, it was just pure scientific inquiry, curiosity. Nobody was paying attention. As A.I. became more powerful, as more resources from the industry poured into it, as its social impact was surfacing -- it is a natural course of a profound technological change that it brings complexity.
Our ecosystem of innovation in America is hopefully driven by a combination of private sector, public sector and government. Right now, we have an imbalance. I'm hoping the public sector can still be a trusted source of evaluating and assessing and understanding and explaining this technology, but also be at the forefront of scientific discovery for the public good.
What risks are you most focused on?
I personally focus on societal risks, from disinformation to bias and privacy, infringement to job disruption, to weaponization.
I do think there is responsibility, especially for the media, as well as the government, to engage in this discourse responsibly. I'm concerned when the media is biasing their megaphones to very few voices that are much more hyperbolic, focusing on existential crises, rather than the real social risks that will deeply impact everyday people, especially people from underserved communities.
Is the government doing enough?
President Biden's executive order was a good first step because it's broad and relatively balanced. But that truly is a first step. What is really important is to have the humility, especially for policymakers and business leaders, to recognize that this is new. So learn about what this is before making policy.
DealBook readers respond: Sam Bankman-Fried
As crypto crime watchers know, Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on Nov. 2 for his role in the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. The big question remaining: How long of a prison term will the 31-year-old get?
The maximum term is more than 100 years. Last Saturday, we asked DealBook readers what would be a fair sentence. Many respondents shared their view that the judge should not go easy on Bankman-Fried at the sentencing hearing, scheduled for March.
Here's a selection of what readers had to say about Bankman-Fried, the American justice system and the wider cryptocurrency market:
"Perhaps because I am a former prosecutor, I believe white-collar criminals should be sentenced on a par with violent ones, or perhaps more severely because the societal impacts are generally broader and the mitigating factors (socioeconomic status, etc.) are less compelling." -- Ted Baker
"What about the crypto investors who got fleeced; how does locking him up help them? Retributive justice and rehabilitation don't speak in any way to making the investors as whole as possible." -- Thomas Haible
"I think a factor is that crypto is primarily a fixation of gamblers. Call them traders. Call them investors. But they're not. They're bettors." -- Barry Morse

World-Class Shopper Will Sell Some of Her Treasures: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mouna Ayoub has a huge collection of haute couture, and now, 252 of her Chanel pieces designed by Karl Lagerfeld are going up for auction.
Once upon a time -- 1976, in fact -- a beautiful, poor 18-year-old Lebanese waitress named Mouna Ayoub was cleaning tables in Paris. She caught the eye of an older man, a billionaire from Saudi Arabia. They married, and he soon whisked her away from France to a life of gilded splendor in the desert kingdom.
A rags-to-riches story -- but not exactly a fairy tale. Ms. Ayoub was often lonely and unhappy. To distract herself, she threw herself into a new pastime: buying clothes. Not just any clothes, but haute couture looks made to order by a handful of Parisian houses that can cost anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 300,000.
Today Ms. Ayoub, who divorced her husband in 1997, owns more than 2,700 pieces, making her collection of haute couture one of the world's largest. On Nov. 20, 252 pieces designed by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel will go on sale in Paris.
The sale, called the Golden Years of Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel From the Mona Ayoub Haute Couture Collection, is organized by Maurice Auction in Paris and the British fashion auctioneer Kerry Taylor. The pieces are from the early 1990s to 2014 and include embroidered lace evening gowns, sequined cocktail suits and classic wool crepe jackets, along with classic flap bags, belts, jewelry and shoes.
So, why is Ms. Ayoub selling them now?
"Well, for one thing, I don't fit into my clothes anymore," Ms. Ayoub, 66, said. She was seated in a private salon at the Hotel Costes in Paris earlier this month and wore a monochrome tunic of graphic camellia prints with a matching bag and black patent leather knee-high boots. (All brand-new fall 2023 Chanel, of course.)
"But the real reason," she said, "is that I've carefully looked after many of these Karl pieces for 30 or 40 years now, and he is no longer with us. So it's about time they were seen and that somebody else got a chance to wear and enjoy them."
Ms. Ayoub has rules when it comes to her collection. She requires four fittings for each outfit, but preferably six. If a piece is not perfect, it will be returned. Many couture houses have their very own Mouna mannequin so that they can tailor clothes to her in case she is not available for a fitting. ("Essential," she said.)
She never wears the same dress twice, and sometimes never at all. She guessed that 90 percent of the Chanel auction lots have never been worn in public. Instead, they have been preserved in special boxes in which they lie flat and are shielded from light, dust, humidity and the archenemy -- moths -- in a high-security warehouse outside Paris.
"I am fanatical about couture," Ms. Ayoub said. "For so long it was my greatest passion." Often, she said, she acquired pieces simply for their beauty and craftsmanship.
"The world doesn't always see couture pieces as works of art, which it should," she said. "When I started buying couture in the early 1990s, it was because I wanted to protect this world and the beauty it created at a time when as a business it was under threat."
"Don't forget, my collection came from the fact I could buy what I wanted, but I couldn't publicly wear what I bought," she said, referring to restrictions on what women could wear in Saudi Arabia. "My favorite part was the fitting, with the wonderful seamstresses, and being surrounded by all the love and attention they would give you."
Part of the proceeds of the auction will go to Fondation des Femmes, a French charity for women affected by violence and abuse. Four of its shelters had been earmarked for closure after a drop in funding. Money from the sale will help keep two of them open.
Ms. Ayoub said her biggest passion now is her eight grandchildren. She still buys couture, but for a specific wedding or red carpet event. She likes Maria Grazia Chiuri at Dior and Virginie Viard at Chanel, and Giorgio Armani, but she is particularly excited by the couture creations of Daniel Roseberry, the American designer now at Schiaparelli, and Kim Jones at Fendi. She still wears a piece only once.
Was there an outfit from the auction collection that she loved the most? A long black Coromandel coat from the fall 1996 Chanel show at the Ritz in Paris, she said, where it had been modeled by Stella Tennant.
Inspired by the 18th-century Chinese lacquer screens that adorned Gabrielle Chanel's private apartment, it was said to have taken seamstresses at Maison Lesage more than 800 hours to create. In 2012, Ms Ayoub wore it to a party at a Chanel boutique, open with a black turtleneck and pants. Mr. Lagerfeld was not happy.
"He was very annoyed," Ms. Ayoub said. "He said that it was not at all how it was supposed to be worn and that it should be closed." She explained to him that she had gained weight since the 1990s and that fastening it would be impossible.
"He thought that was very funny," she said with a smile. "He said, 'Oh, Mouna, join the club!"'

Momentum Slows as Worries Rise About Profits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks drifted to a mixed finish on Thursday as Wall Street's momentum slowed after its hot first half of November.
The S&P 500 edged up by 5.36 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,508.24 and remained comfortably on track for its third straight winning week. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 45.74, or 0.1 percent, to 34,945.47, and the Nasdaq composite gained 9.84, or 0.1 percent, to 14,113.67.
Walmart weighed on the market with an 8.1 percent drop after it warned that shoppers began pulling back on spending late last month. Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, also gave a forecast for holiday profit that was weaker than analysts expected, despite topping forecasts for results in its latest quarter.
Cisco Systems tumbled 9.8 percent even though it also reported stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts estimated. The company saw a slowdown of new product orders last quarter, and it gave forecasts for earnings this quarter and fiscal year that were weaker than analysts expected.
Stocks in the oil and gas industry were particularly weak after the price of crude tumbled sharply to its lowest since July. Marathon Petroleum dropped 3.5 percent, and Halliburton fell 3.3 percent.
November nevertheless remains on track to be the S&P 500's best month in a year.
Investors are betting inflation is cooling enough to persuade the Federal Reserve to halt its increases to interest rates following its fusillade since last year. That in turn has pushed expectations up for when the Fed could begin cutting rates, which can act like steroids for financial markets, in the summer.
Several more reports on Thursday indicated a slowing economy. While the weaker-than-expected data are of course a signal the economy may be losing some of its strong momentum, for investors, they just as importantly may be showing that upward pressures on inflation is easing.
One report said that slightly more workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. The number is still low relative to history, but a softening in the job market could prevent the too-strong raises in workers' pay that the Fed fears could trigger a vicious cycle keeping inflation high.
Separate reports said that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is unexpectedly weakening, while U.S. industrial production weakened more than expected in October.
The Fed has been trying to shepherd the economy along a tightrope, to slow just enough to stamp out high inflation without falling into a recession. Thursday's weaker-than-expected reports strengthened investors' hopes that the Fed can pull it off and go easier on interest rates. That triggered an immediate drop in Treasury yields.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to about 4.45 percent from 4.54 percent late Wednesday. Just last month, it was above 5 percent at its highest level since 2007 and raising worries on Wall Street as it undercut prices for stocks and other investments.
Lower yields offer more breathing space for financial markets, and 45 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 rose.
Macy's jumped 5.7 percent after delivering a surprising profit for the latest quarter. Sonos leaped 17.1 percent on speculation that it may start selling headphones in the second half of its fiscal year.
A slowing economy would mean softer growth in demand for fuel, and worries are already high about swelling inventories for crude oil. That sent crude oil prices skidding sharply.
A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude for delivery in December tumbled $ 3.76 to settle at $ 72.90. Brent crude, the international standard, also dropped $ 3.76, to $ 77.42 per barrel.
In stock markets abroad, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3 percent after Japan reported that its exports rose a meager 1.6 percent in October, down from September's growth.

To Understand Luxury Economics, Study Psychology: [Style Desk]

Full text: The exorbitant cost of luxury fashion has left us out in the cold, wondering who can sustain this market?
Historically, luxury fashion brands have enjoyed strong pricing power, meaning that they can apply considerable increases without necessarily losing customers. But in 2023, price tags hit eye-watering highs -- and there has been no sign of the trend slowing.
According to the data company EDITED, average luxury prices are up by 25 percent since 2019. Many brands attribute their increases to everything from inflation and the balancing out of regional price disparities to the fallout of the pandemic and impact of the war in Ukraine. But for many luxury fashion brands, the uptick has been taking place over a longer timeline.
Take Chanel, where handbag prices have more than doubled since 2016. The auction house Sotheby's found a classic 2.55 Chanel bag sold for around $ 1,650 in 2008. In 2023, that figure from Chanel is closer to $ 10,200. (If the cost had risen in line with inflation over the 15-year period, it would be expected to cost $ 2,359). This week, Pharrell Williams, the men's creative director at Vuitton, unveiled the label's new Millionaire Speedy Bag. The crocodile hide bag is made-to-order, costs a cool million and has a distinctly Scrooge McDuck aura.
"Industrywide, the pricing has gotten truly absurd," the influencer Bryan Yambao noted in an Instagram post this week when discussing a $ 6,000 woolen Miu Miu coat. "I do think this is a good time for most brands to lower their prices."
In the past year there have been signs that so-called aspirational customers, who buy entry-level luxury products like cosmetics and spirits, have curbed their spending. Middle class professionals who once saved up for a luxury investment handbag or coat have been aggressively priced out.
So who is spending $ 3,000 on a knit hat shaped like a duck from the British brand Burberry? What about $ 24,500 on a vicuña jacket by Brunello Cucinelli? Or $ 1,250 on a white cotton shirt by The Row?
The answer is the 1 percent, obviously (or those willing to incur credit card debt). Luca Solca, an analyst for Bernstein, estimates that the top 5 percent of luxury clients now account for more than 40 percent of sales for most luxury goods brands. As wealth inequality increases globally, luxury brands are doubling down on an ever smaller slice of their clientele. Will this strategy work? Or is there a backlash brewing which might force the luxury pricing bubble to burst?
The below discussion among Style journalists has been edited and condensed.
Elizabeth Paton To many people, luxury price tags have always been absurd and almost amoral. And prices in luxury fashion keep going up, and up, and up. Does it matter to customers?
Vanessa Friedman The high prices of Phoebe Philo's new line certainly struck a nerve, despite the fact they are actually at the lower end of the luxury market. It made me wonder why it was the Philo line that sparked such outrage.
Stella Bugbee It's rare to see a collection for the first time and be simultaneously confronted by the prices. We go to fashion shows and admire or critique them on a conceptual level, but often what we see on the runway doesn't make it to the store. It was also more expensive than the old Celine.
VF Although, almost everything "luxury" (including new Celine) is now more expensive than old Celine. Also, perhaps, because Phoebe has become such a mythic, fashion-savior-of-women, rightly or wrongly, and we were waiting for years for her line, a fantasy arose in which she also saved more women by making her clothes available to more people. For some of her fans these prices almost seem like a betrayal.
EP The balance between accessibility and exclusivity has always been a tricky one for luxury fashion brands, especially as the sector expanded into new markets. Now, many people who might have treated themselves with a bag are tightening their belts.
VF Well, the 1 percent are the target market for high fashion. The rest of us are left with perfume and lipstick.
EP Right, but a certain type of professional used to feel like they could save for a special piece. A Burberry raincoat. A Gucci handbag. Those are out of range for nearly everyone now.
Guy Trebay Don't forget about credit card debt, which the Federal Reserve currently pegs at over $ 1 trillion.
SB The resale economy has also changed the calculus. You can get all of those things secondhand, not long after they sell for full price.
EP And if they are hot enough items, they can sell for even more than full price! Like an Hermès Birkin for example.
VF There's a sort of warring imperative here between people who see it as a badge of honor not to buy full price and those who belong to the very tiny club that can. Economics are involved, but as much as anything, it's also psychology.
EP Resale is also a good barometer for whether pricing strategies are working. Chanel and Hermès drive the top of the resale market. More trend-driven high-fashion houses -- who have been raising their prices -- don't fare so well. If there is a market correction, it will be more directed toward brands where people take a loss on products they want to sell on the secondary market.
Jessica Testa I know of at least one resale website, the Paris-based ReSee, where Philo-era Celine is the third most popular brand, below Chanel and Hermès. And there are several independent sellers on Instagram dedicated exclusively to selling Philo-era Celine designs, fetching prices above what they cost at retail 10 years ago. There are people who spend years hunting eBay for one specific product in their size.
VF Which brings me back to Phoebe Philo's current scarcity model: We don't even know how much of any piece they produced (the company wouldn't say) but the message is the market will bear the prices, since the products are sold out. We think because it is more expensive, it has more value.
GT This is the stuff for which Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel. Subjects shown two identical cashmere sweaters, one at a far higher price, inevitably chose the more costly of the two. His point was that we don't think. We act irrationally.
VF I go back to the idea of betrayal. Because so many women relate to Phoebe Philo as a person, or at least the idea of Phoebe and what her work once represented, they felt excluded or ill-served by the pricing of her new line. They cared deeply about what she was going to make, and then it seemed as if she didn't really care at all about including them.
EP Also that Phoebe -- and the powers that be in luxury -- spent a considerable period courting aspirational audiences. It's just now they're pulling the drawbridge up. Fashion is always at risk of looking out of touch with the wider world, and certain items that seem to have gone viral on social in recent months -- like the Burberry duck hat -- triggered particular wrath, more so than usual.
VF Burberry is also selling a $ 21,000 viscose dress with a Burberry knight riding across the front.
GT Better at that point to pin dollar bills to your chest.
EP Speaking of dollars, a quarter of a trillion them have been wiped off the value of Europe's seven biggest luxury businesses since April, and sales are generally down across most fashion groups. That is the aspirational middle class stepping away from the credit card machine.
JT My pet peeve is when high-end brands collaborate with mass-market brands and yet the pricing doesn't even meet in the middle -- it's still $ 900.
EP Like the recent Banana Republic collaboration with Peter Do.
GT And that's relatively new. By contrast, there were the wonderful and completely affordable collabs Jil Sander, Tomas Maier and others did with Uniqlo.
JT Guy Trebay may have complimented my Clare Waight Keller Uniqlo bag a mere two days ago, folks.
EP The collabs do occasionally have some treasures!
VF In a sense they give the luxury brands an excuse for their pricing, because they can say, "Well, but we did this or that mass market collab."
EP I agree and I don't think we will see this approach by the luxury powers changing anytime soon. The bubble doesn't seem to be bursting -- yet.

'Free' iPhone Can Cost You In the End: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The so-called iPhone giveaways marketed by Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T can make customers spend more on perks they don't need.
There's no such thing as a free iPhone.
But phone carriers would like you to believe otherwise. Over the last few weeks, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile have blitzed their websites, billboards and stores with ads proclaiming that you can "get the iPhone 15 Pro, on us."
To get this $ 1,000 iPhone for $ 0, the carriers say, all you have to do is trade in an older phone and sign up for a wireless plan. In reality, the phone freebie promotions can lure smartphone owners into spending more in the long run by requiring them to subscribe to more exorbitant service plans bundled with superfluous features, such as big high-speed data packages and subscriptions to streaming services.
I spent several days plugging numbers into the carriers' websites and chatting with store representatives to get some realistic out-the-door numbers. To test the promotions, I submitted a three-year-old iPhone 12 as a hypothetical trade-in. (On average, people upgrade to a new phone every three years.)
Here were the costs of getting the new iPhone 15 Pro through the promotions, excluding taxes:
Verizon's free iPhone deal would cost about $ 3,240 over the 36 months required to redeem the promotion, roughly $ 300 more than buying the new iPhone with a cheaper Verizon plan in the same period.
AT&T's deal would cost a customer about $ 2,675 over the 36 months required to redeem the promotion, a little bit more than doing a trade-in for the new phone and selecting a cheaper AT&T plan.
T-Mobile's promotion would cost $ 2,400 over two years to redeem the phone credit, about $ 160 more than buying the new iPhone with a cheaper T-Mobile plan.
"People who think they're getting free phones from the carrier are in for a surprise," said Toni Toikka, the chief executive of Alekstra, a consulting firm that helps businesses reduce their cellphone bills.
Verizon said that customers could choose which plan was best for them, and that the promotions were intended for people looking for the best network experience. T-Mobile said that deals were not just about free phones and it strove to provide the best value with its premium plans that include perks like Netflix streaming and the flexibility to upgrade frequently. AT&T declined to comment.
If you are looking to save a buck, it is always a good idea to trade in your old phone for credit to shave down the cost of a new one. Just be wary of any promotion offering a freebie.
Let's dive deeper into the iPhone giveaway promotions advertised by Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. Then I'll share some better ways to save money with trade-ins.
Verizon
Verizon's requirements to get a free iPhone 15 Pro are the most aggressive. Trading in an iPhone 12 can earn you $ 1,000 in the form of bill credits spread out over 36 months. To be eligible, I had to choose a $ 90-a-month wireless service plan called Unlimited Ultimate. The total cost over the three years would be $ 3,240.
In contrast, if I traded in the iPhone 12 and picked one of Verizon's cheaper plans, like the $ 65-a-month Unlimited Welcome, a basic cellular plan with unlimited data, Verizon would offer $ 415 for the three-year-old iPhone. The total to buy and use an iPhone 15 Pro on the cheaper plan for three years would be $ 2,925.
The main benefit of Verizon's pricier Unlimited Ultimate plan is that it offers 60 gigabytes of mobile hotspotting, which allows you to share a phone's cellular data connection with a computer. Some people may want this feature, but most will not need it -- only 4 percent of mobile users consume more than 50 gigabytes of cellular data a month, according to a report by the technology conglomerate Cisco.
So with Verizon's free iPhone promotion, you would spend $ 315 more over three years for a plan with fancy perks than if you traded in your old phone and picked a cheaper Verizon plan.
AT&T
AT&T is offering up to $ 1,000 off the iPhone 15 Pro with an eligible trade-in. Only the most recent and most expensive smartphones, like last year's iPhone 14 Pro, are eligible for the full $ 1,000 in credit. Older phones get less.
AT&T provided a promotional credit of $ 700 for the three-year-old iPhone 12 in the form of discounts spread out over 36 months of bill payments. That brought the cost of the iPhone 15 Pro to $ 8.30 a month spread out over three years.
To get the promotion, I also had to choose one of AT&T's eligible data plans, which start at $ 65 a month. All told, including one-time fees, the cost of buying an iPhone 15 Pro and using it on AT&T's network with an eligible plan over three years came out to $ 2,675.
In contrast, if I traded in the iPhone 12 and picked one of AT&T's cheaper plans, like the $ 50 Value Plus plan, AT&T would offer $ 200 in credit for the older phone, which shaves the price of the iPhone 15 Pro down to $ 800. Over the course of 36 months on the cheaper plan, the total would be $ 2,635.
The main difference between the $ 50 plan and the $ 65 plan is that the latter offers three gigabytes of mobile hotspotting.
This means you are not getting a free iPhone from AT&T through this promotion. Instead, you would pay roughly $ 40 extra over three years for a plan with a mobile hot spot feature.
T-Mobile
T-Mobile is offering to make the iPhone 15 Pro free once you trade in your older phone and sign up for its Go5G Next plan, at $ 100 a month. The free iPhone comes in the form of bill credits spread out over 24 months. Over two years, you pay about $ 2,400.
But if you sign up for the cheaper Essentials plan at $ 60 a month, which is not part of the promotion, T-Mobile will offer $ 200 for the iPhone 12. After you buy the iPhone 15 Pro for $ 800, the total cost over two years would be $ 2,240.
T-Mobile's cheaper Essentials plan includes 50 gigabytes of high-speed data, which is more than enough. The Go5G Next plan includes unlimited high-speed data and subscriptions to Netflix and Apple TV+.
Once again, you are not really getting a free iPhone, but are paying roughly $ 160 more over two years for extra data and streaming services.
"Consumers may find it challenging to determine whether the more expensive plan offers additional value," Mr. Toikka said.
Bottom Line
Promotions are temporary, so once the terms expire, the wireless service rates will probably shoot up -- and you could end up spending more without noticing.
But don't let these promotions discourage you. It's still a great idea to sell your old phone to save some bucks on a new one, and there are a plethora of trade-in programs online.
Sites like Gazelle, Best Buy, Amazon and Swappa offer cash or store credit for your old phone, and their quotes for used phones are usually higher than the phone carriers'. To reduce costs of your phone, shop around for the best offer and pick a wireless plan that suits your budget and needs.
I recently sold my wife's iPhone 12 through Gazelle for $ 312 in cash, which she used toward buying an iPhone 15 directly from Apple. That shaved the price of the new phone down to about $ 500, and she stuck with the cheap family plan that she has used for years with her siblings.
That's a far cry from free. But it beats burning extra cash on a fancy wireless package she won't use.

Full text: I thought pantyhose were dead, but now it seems as if they are being treated as the equivalent of actual pants. Are we supposed to believe the pantyhose-instead-of-pants look I see on social media is going to be a trend? And I thought leggings were bad.
Susan, Vancouver, B.C. It's true: Pantyhose (one of the most unappealing names for a garment ever invented) have been on the rise for a few seasons now, after disappearing almost entirely from many wardrobes as women not in the British royal family were freed from some of the more egregious dress code strictures of the past century.
Invented in 1959 by Allen Gant Sr., who called them "panti-legs," pantyhose may have revolutionized foundation garments by doing away with the girdle, garter belt and stockings, but by the millennium, being able to say no to pulling on a pair of flesh-sucking sheer tights was a sign of liberation. The fashion world became so attached to the End of Pantyhose that editors famously went to shows in February with bare legs and high heels, snow be damned.
Then, in September 2022, Matthieu Blazy of Bottega Veneta sent a navy crew neck down his runway paired with only dark hose and heels. A few months later, Miuccia Prada largely tossed pants and skirts out the window in her Miu Miu show, subversively matching her librarian cardigans and beatnik polo necks with sheer hose. A vibe was born. Or reborn.
Of course, Mrs. Prada did not invent the no-pants look -- that was popularized by Edie Sedgwick back when she was Andy Warhol's It girl, prancing around the Factory in black tights and a boat-neck tee. That may have been the reference when Emma Corrin (an It person of the moment) closed the Miu Miu fall show in a camel turtleneck, gold sparkly bikini bottoms and sheer brown hose.
Little wonder that earlier this month the audience at the spring 2024 Miu Miu show was chockablock with pants-less influencers, all vying for the title of It girl. Or that the style has been picked up by such figures as Kendall Jenner, who modeled the Bottega look in real life, and Rihanna, who went pantsless at ASAP Rocky's birthday dinner, wearing a ruffled chiffon top, bomber jacket and glossy tights.
Most people who live in the real world will never forgo their pants in favor of tights. But given that extreme runway fashion has a way of trickling down and becoming digestible for everyday, and given the talent Miuccia Prada has for making today what everyone wears tomorrow, odds are that the no-pants-but-pantyhose look may lead to a pantyhose renaissance.
Indeed, during the last round of fall 2023 shows, Virginie Viard was pairing white lace tights with almost every look on her Chanel runway. And Boss, Dolce & Gabbana, LaQuan Smith and Saint Laurent all featured sheer black pantyhose with pencil skirts and cocktail frocks.
All of which is good news for those who appreciate the smoothing, buffing effect that sheer pantyhose has on legs, not to mention the bit of added warmth when the temperature falls. Personally, I think they would be more popular if someone came up with a better name.

Look Who's on the Scent: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Corporations are now mimicking fashion designers and hiring development firms to create a signature scent that clients won't forget.
Dora Baghriche grew up in Algiers, where the scents of jasmine, pine, orange blossom and Mediterranean salt spray swirled around her, wafting into her memory.
"Both of my grandmothers were chefs so I grew up in the kitchens and smelling the fields of flowers around our house," she said from her home in Paris. Ms. Baghriche, a senior perfumer at the fragrance development company Firmenich, has since created scents for major fashion houses like Yves Saint Laurent and Estée Lauder.
But one of the most unusual challenges of her career came when an unexpected brand asked her to design a fragrance for new spaces they were building called "experience centers."
The brand was Mastercard, befuddling Ms. Baghriche, 43. "When Mastercard told me what they wanted to do, my first question was, 'Why?"' she said.
The mission behind the experience centers is to give the credit card giant a physical footprint for its brand and show off its newest technology. This was unexplored territory for Mastercard, and the company's marketing team wanted to create a space that engaged all of a customer's senses.
Companies using bespoke scents in their spaces are nothing new. Hotels that want to exude a sense of luxurious relaxation have been designing their own candles for decades, and no one who stepped into an Abercrombie & Fitch store in the 2000s will ever forget the olfactory sting of the brand's musky cologne that fogged their retail stores.
But smell is increasingly becoming part of the brand strategy for companies in unexpected industries, as brands jostle for precious slivers of market share and especially as workers and clients begin to trickle back into office spaces. So the unlikeliest of companies are joining the scent trend.
"Traditionally, marketers have focused on creating mostly a visual identity for their brands. A logo, a design style, the kind of thing that makes it easy to say 'that's Apple' or 'that's Mastercard.' But one key thing that wasn't appreciated is that we're generally blessed with five senses," said Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing officer at Mastercard.
Mr. Rajamannar, 61, spearheaded the "multisensory brand identity" effort for the credit card company, and commissioned Ms. Baghriche and Firmenich to create a dual set of complementary fragrances inspired by the interlocking red and orange circles from Mastercard's logo and the abstract prompts "passion" and "optimism."
Since you can't smell a TV or internet ad -- they're working on that -- fragrance hasn't been much of a consideration for marketing departments in industries like insurance and financial services. But physical spaces are now doubling as unorthodox, semi-permanent marketing efforts. Luxury car brands like Genesis operate white-tablecloth restaurants with classically-trained chefs, and the travel search platform Kayak runs a hotel in Miami.
"We have customers that often ask about the scent and whether it's for sale," said Rachel Espersen, executive director of brand experience at Genesis House and Studios, a multipurpose space in the Meatpacking district operated by the luxury carmaker. The venue contains a restaurant, a library and a showroom, and the company designed three scents that are diffused in different spaces. "In our studio and showcase spaces, we either use a scent called 'Down to Earth' or 'Coming Home,' depending on the space's specific design. The first floor showroom and cellar stage at Genesis House uses the 'Down to Earth' scent," she said in an email.
Credit card companies have been especially active in this new arena: Mastercard has its "experience centers" in cities like Dubai, Mexico City, and New York. American Express has created a Centurion members club in a high-rise in New York, and has exclusive airport lounges. Automakers are extending their brand names to condominiums, especially in Miami.
How a place smells is now something that companies need to think about in the same way they pick out chairs or choose wallpaper.
They also need to budget for them. "A custom scent could be anywhere from $ 5,000 to $ 65,000, and we live on the higher end of that number," said Dawn Goldworm, the co-founder of 12.29, a scent branding company that has worked with several large banks and car companies, including Cadillac.
Developing a bespoke scent is only the beginning as well, as companies have to pay for the creation of fragrance oil and a dedicated dispersal system that can sometimes be installed in a space's HVAC system. "It can cost anywhere from $ 100 every month to thousands every month. You need the machinery, you need someone to install it, you need someone to service it, and you need the supply of fragrance oil on a regular basis," Ms. Goldworm, 44, said.
Perfumers like Ms. Baghriche are typically tasked with creating scents that live on skin, where biochemical reactions can alter how a fragrance smells on different people. If delicate changes like a person's skin pH level can change the iconic whiff of, say, Chanel No. 5 perfume, how do you create a stable scent for millions of square feet of commercial space?
Part of the answer is creating a fragrance that doesn't make anyone run for the exits. "Universality was a really important factor. We didn't want to design anything that would be shocking to a specific culture," Ms. Baghriche said.
Some smells -- fresh citrus, floral notes -- hold a sweeping appeal, and Ms. Baghriche considered those scents when she was developing Mastercard's scent. The twin scents she created -- "Priceless Passion" and "Priceless Optimism" -- have murmurs of rose, sweet grass and orange.
Smell and memory speak fluently to one another. Research has shown our olfactory senses develop more quickly than sight, and that the creation of memories associated with smell follows a more direct path than sound.
In a way, Ms. Baghriche's job is to use the echoes of jasmine, orange blossom, and the Mediterranean salt spray from her own life to impress new memories on those who encounter her work. "Our house was in a pine forest and we lived just above the sea," she said. "I grew up with all those Mediterranean smells. It was a really romantic childhood."

Full text: Cristaseya isn't trying to hide, it just knows that the right people will find it.
Cristaseya is a decade-old clothing line operated by Cristina Casini and her husband Andrea Spotorno, two Italians who moved to Paris nearly 20 years ago from Milan. If you're lucky enough to know about it, the best place to shop for Cristaseya is the second floor of nondescript office building at 7 Rue Ambroise Thomas in the 9th arrondissement. Not only because the entire collection is there -- "This is the atelier, the showroom, the store, everything," Ms. Casini said one afternoon during Paris Fashion Week in late September -- but because it is difficult to find the line elsewhere.
Casa Cristaseya, as the Rue Ambroise Thomas space is called, is open by appointment only. Many of those who make one have been directed there by a fashion-insider friend with good taste. For the artist Martine Syms, who has collaborated with Prada, it was the fashion publicist Poppy Edmonds. For Emily Rahimpour, a creative director in Los Angeles whose clients include Byredo, it was the stylist Charlotte Collet. For Zoë Ghertner, the fashion photographer who shoots campaigns for Miu Miu and Chloe, it was Christiane Juergensen, who works with Phoebe Philo.
"There is no way I would've found out about it had it not been introduced to me by someone that I know and work with," Ms. Ghertner said.
Of the 45 or so stores that carry Cristaseya, most are in Japan with a few in the United States, including Mameg in Los Angeles, Viola Lovely in Boston, Oroboro in New York and AP Shop, a seasonal boutique in Lakeside, Mich., that is open Friday to Monday, May through January. No other store in France besides Casa Cristaseya carries the collection, and Cristaseya is not sold in Italy, despite the fact that Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno are Italian and much of their fabric comes from Italy and their production is done there.
"They think about luxury in the sense of luxury," Ms. Casini said, indicating the use of the term as a catchall for a certain price, branding and marketing style rather than a measure of the quality of goods and services. "That is not really what we like. Already the word 'luxury,' I don't like it because it's a bit, I don't know, vulgar."
Words Ms. Casini does like include "discreet" and "rareness." In the small world of Cristaseya, Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno enjoy complete freedom and control. Everything is a reflection of their personal curiosities and pleasures: a big wooden table Mr. Spotorno designed, an exhibition of photography by Jacob Holdt held in a gallery space upstairs from the showroom.
The clothes bear the influence of traditional Italian and Japanese tailoring. (Keiko Seya, an original partner, left the company a few years ago and now runs the label Seya.) Ms. Casini was previously a stylist. Mr. Spotorno photographs and art directs all of the imagery for the collection, sometimes using Cristaseya's two other employees -- Wonji Hong, the collection director, and Herta Bernane, the sales director -- as models. The look is arty but playful. It's not sexy, but it's smart in its slightly twisted understatement.
Ms. Rahimpour was introduced to Cristaseya in its early days and was charmed by Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno's approach. At the time, Ms. Rahimpour was working as the in-house art director for Chanel Beauty.
"I entered the company at a time when it was like a family business, and then it became this multinational, and everything at the time was turning into a multinational," she said. "Cristaseya is more about the clothes and the experience. You go to the atelier, and there's this tactile element. Like, the clothes on your skin. You feel comfortable, the fabrics are extraordinary."
For years, big department stores, like Le Bon Marché and Galeries Lafayette, and major e-commerce sites, like Matchesfashion.com and Ssense, have been trying to add Cristaseya to their vast assortments, but Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno refuse to sell to them.
"When everything looks the same with everything together, it's not special," Ms. Casini said. "We don't want to see the product there. And if I were a Cristaseya client, I wouldn't want to see the product there." Ssense, in particular, is known for buying an incomprehensible number of brands, many of which are destined to end up 70 percent marked down. "It's a bit sick," Ms. Casini said.
Cristaseya never goes on sale. It is expensive. An oversize reversible Japanese wool coat -- tentlike yet somehow elegant -- with leather piping is 2,806 euro (about $ 2,975). An oversize shirt, handmade by the Neapolitan shirtmaker Salvatore Piccolo, is 594 euros. An oversize baby camel's hair sweater is 1,169 euro. The fabrics and silhouettes, mostly unisex with a slightly raw, textured hand, are much more interesting and appealing in person than online. The collection does not abide by the fashion industry's traditional seasonal model, wherein there's spring, fall and two pre-collections, all of which are available for that season and then never again.
Cristaseya releases editions, two per year, and pieces from all editions are constantly in the mix. Edition 1 was called Winter Sky, and everything was navy. Edition 2 was Shirting. Edition 3 was Camel. Editions 18 and 19 were Sardegna, for which Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno branched out into ceramics, a "pibiones" style rug, picked out in raised loops, and 18-karat gold filigree jewelry that he designed and executed with local artisans from Sardinia. All of the knitwear is produced by Ms. Casini's mother's company Maglierie Cristina in Reggio Emilia.
"She really does it with love," Ms. Casini said.
In the beginning, Ms. Casini and Mr. Spotorno tried to avoid selling the collection online. "It's something that you have to experience, to touch -- it's expensive," Ms. Casini said. "You have to listen to the story, the savoir faire and tra-la-la. But then obviously, it was not possible to not do any online."
They've adopted a quirky model. The online shop opens temporarily and seemingly arbitrarily -- a week here, a few days there -- posted to Cristaseya's email distribution list and on Instagram.
"I think it's interesting," said Salima Boufelfel, the owner of the Desert Vintage stores in Arizona and New York. "I like the feeling of it."
This limited-access modus operandi is less about driving hype and intrigue for hype and intrigue's sake, in the way that brands like Supreme have become famous for their drops, than about manpower and capacity. The four employees can handle only so much demand. "It's a lot of work," Mr. Spotorno said.
That said, clients can contact them at any time, and Ms. Bernane will send a link to a product page. "But it's not everybody contacting us," Ms. Casini said. "You really need to be very motivated."
This state of mind may make fashion giants shudder, but it's yielded a tight bond between Cristaseya and its clients. As Mr. Spotorno said, "We know them, they know us."

Full text: How Miuccia Prada -- and Miu Miu -- became the muse of the season. Plus a detour through Chanel and Louis Vuitton.
Want to know what you will wear next?
Quite possibly a rah-rah skirt so short it shows your rear end or (if you are of a mind-set that eschews rah-rah skirts) a pencil skirt or pair of trousers or even pair of men's swim trunks that sit so low on the hips they flirt with bumster-dom. They'll probably be cinched with a wide leather belt or at the very least expose the elastic logo waistband of your underwear.
With them, a schoolboy striped Oxford shirt, navy V-neck sweater and navy blazer. Or maybe you'll forget the pants and skirts entirely -- too much to think about! -- and just toss a jeweled flapper wrap dress or a gold brocade opera coat over your shirt. Then you might stuff an extra pair of shoes, the kind that gave you blisters so you had to put Band-Aids on your heels but you love them so you'll take them anyway, into your handbag before sprinting out the door.
Or that's what you may wear next if what appeared on the Miu Miu catwalk at the close of Paris Fashion Week is any indication.
But why, you say, scratching your head, would Miu Miu have anything to do with it?
Not just because the show was fantastic -- one that seemed to be channeling Simone de Beauvoir or Natalia Ginzburg en route to the flower market after a late night of pub quizzes and philosophical debate.
But because ever since Miuccia Prada enlisted Raf Simons as co-creative director at Prada in Milan, freeing herself up to pay more attention to what had always been seen as Prada's little sister line, the Miu Miu brand -- not to mention Mrs. Prada's whole aesthetic -- has quietly become one of the most influential in fashion.
If in doubt, simply consider the number of audience members who arrived at the show in hot pants and tights (not since the age of Mary Quant have so many upper thighs been so visible). Or consider how much Mrs. Prada's work has shaped what has appeared on other catwalks since this fashion month began.
Indeed, it would not be overstating things to say Mrs. Prada has been the muse of the season.
The Mrs. Prada Effect
It started during New York Fashion Week, when Joseph Altuzarra offered up what was essentially an ode to early Prada in cocooning uniform coats, sheer pencil skirts and frumpy knits -- a theme that was repeated three weeks later in Paris at Matthew M. Williams's show for Givenchy, which featured similar Prada-isms in pastel shades speckled among his lithe black dresses (elegant, but generic).
In Milan, short shorts -- the kind that looked an awful lot like the hot pants Mrs. Prada showed for Miu Miu last season, which were an evolution of the truncated skirts she showed the season before -- became the trend of the week at Gucci, Bally and Etro. Versace embraced the concept of the shorts set, which came in the wake of the Miu Miu set renaissance of early 2022.
Hot pants -- dotted with costume jewels even -- popped up again at Stella McCartney, paired with ruffled tuxedo shirts and cool suiting, amid the backdrop of the designer's sustainability market showcasing various material technologies, and a host of her own greatest hits. Even Victoria Beckham, who seems to be struggling to find a new fashion identity, threw some bodysuits, with undies peeking out around the edges, under cardigans into her mix of tailoring and transparency.
It's not that anyone is overtly referencing Mrs. Prada (or it's not like most of them are). But she has become so masterful at cozying up to the clichés of gender, burrowing down and recontextualizing them, so good at using clothes to wrestle with the desire to be pretty and frivolous and serious and stressed all at the same time that her work has started to shape the culture it reflects. In the real world of the street, and the digital world of influencers.
At which point it gets regurgitated back through the maw of other designers, amplifying the ideas. It's not trickle down or trickle up as much as trickle out.
A Detour to Vuitton and Chanel
The Miu Miu effect marks a pretty big shift in the biorhythms of fashion month. After all, years ago, when Mrs. Prada moved her Miu Miu show to Paris to create some breathing room between it and the Prada show in Milan, it was a sort of an addendum, or coda, to the week, after the mega brands of Chanel and Louis Vuitton had brought the season to an end. Lately, however, those shows seem increasingly niche; not smaller physically, but speaking mostly to an echo chamber of their own (paid) celebrities and acolytes.
Vuitton, for example, was held in the brand's new building on the Champs-Élysées, a former Art Deco palace hotel, now a construction site for what the brand would only describe as "a new project."
The soaring ground floor interior had been shrink-wrapped in orange plastic (100 percent recycled and 100 percent recyclable said the show notes) to resemble the interior of a hot-air balloon because, you know, travel (and the brand's birth as a trunk maker). And because the clothes from the designer Nicolas Ghesquière -- layers of striped and plaid mousseline belted at the hip, with leather jackets, candy-cane clown pants and elaborately beaded tweeds -- had their own floaty fussiness to match.
They were complicated-looking, no matter how light the construction, which paradoxically gave them a very French air. You don't want to wear them, but they are compelling all the same. Even if they also seem like a very acquired taste that might take too much effort to acquire, like sweetbreads.
At Chanel, meanwhile, Virginie Viard was riffing on the Villa de Noailles, the 1920s artistic salon in the South of France and the creative milieu Coco shared, with bouclés and seaside stripes, long-line bathing suits and flirty cover-ups, logos and flowers and pearls galore. The problem is, for every great piece -- a pleated black and white halter neck gown, for example, or a kind of ironically fun tweed caftan -- there's another that has all the subtlety of boardwalk souvenir shop Chanel without any of the irony.
"Whatever"
It's Mrs. Prada's self-awareness and ability to both love fashion and recognize the issues with it, to embrace the inherent tensions and related absurdity of even worrying about such tensions, that makes it possible for so many to recognize themselves (or their many selves) in her work.
"Fashion comes when you want a distraction, when you are not too serious," she said after the Miu Miu show. "But then you need to think about the rest, so you need clothes you can live with, and clothes that you can think with."
During the show, a piece of video art titled "Gravity & Grace" from the Qatari-American artist Sophia Al-Maria played on screens set up around the venue, featuring a stuntwoman, Ayesha Hussain, in those Prada hot pants, gas station jackets and knee-high boots, going through different exercises with a sword and a cross bow, and twirling around like a jewel-box ballerina. It didn't have much to do with what was on the runway, other than evincing, the show notes said, "a congruent intellectual viewpoint."
At the finale, after Cailee Spaeny -- the actor who plays Priscilla Presley in Sofia Coppola's coming biopic "Priscilla" -- had walked out in a plain black coat, the video flashed a close-up of a gum-chewing face and the word "whatever."
It was the perfect ending.

Full text: The News
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have made California the first state in the country to expressly ban discrimination based on caste, stating that the measure was "unnecessary" because it was already covered by existing laws.
Why It Matters: The bill reflects divisions in the state's South Asian community and its influence as a growing demographic.
The bill, known as Senate Bill 403, had driven intense debate -- and divisions -- within the growing South Asian community in California recently, especially in Silicon Valley, where South Asians make up a significant share of the work force.
Governor Newsom's rejection of the bill is a victory for some Hindu residents and organizations who had argued that the proposal unfairly targeted them because the caste system is most commonly associated with Hinduism. They asserted that caste discrimination in the United States was rare and that existing laws banning discrimination on the basis of ancestry and religion were sufficient.
"This has been months of concern and stress that we've been carrying about the impact that this would have on the civil rights of all South Asians regardless of background, and we're glad the governor saw the problems with it," said Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, one of the organizations leading the opposition.
It comes as a blow to proponents of the bill who had argued that an explicit ban on caste discrimination was needed to increase awareness that such bias exists in the United States and to reassure victims who want to come forward. A group of South Asian activists had been on a hunger strike outside of Mr. Newsom's office since early September to urge the governor to sign the bill.
In recent years, several universities and companies have added caste to their discrimination policies. Late last month, Fresno officially became the first city in California, and the second in the country after Seattle, to enact such a ban. But Governor Newsom is considering a future run for the White House, and he may not have wanted to get in the middle of longstanding ethnic and religious tensions among some Indian Americans, who are a fast-growing and vital demographic in purple suburbs and swing states.
This month, Republican state legislators, who largely opposed the measure, sent Mr. Newsom a letter echoing arguments from the bill's opponents.
Background: There has been growing awareness in America of caste discrimination.
For thousands of years, Dalits have been a historically oppressed group of people relegated below even the lowest rung of the caste hierarchy in South Asia. India officially outlawed caste discrimination more than 70 years ago, but attitudes and social stratification persist.
In more than a dozen recent interviews with The New York Times, people of Dalit ancestry described various encounters with caste-based bigotry in the United States, in the form of wage theft, housing discrimination, mistreatment in the workplace and social exclusion.
For decades, the South Asian diaspora was composed mainly of upper caste people, in part because they had greater access to the resources necessary to qualify for skilled worker visas. More recently, though, affirmative action policies in India have allowed more people from oppressed communities to attend universities and move abroad.
The caste issue burst into the public conversation in 2020 when California's Civil Rights Department sued Cisco Systems, accusing two of the company's engineers of caste discrimination. Awareness of such discrimination has grown since then, and in March, Aisha Wahab, a California state senator, introduced Senate Bill 403. Senator Wahab's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
What's Next: Legal battles continue.
California lawmakers are not expected to override the veto. But other states and cities could introduce measures banning caste discrimination.
State regulators in California have continued to pursue their lawsuit against Cisco, though they dismissed their claims against the engineers.
Opponents of the bill are likely to continue arguing against new protections. Last year, two Hindu professors sued California State University, hoping to block its addition of caste to its discrimination policy.

Wait, Is That a Live Butterfly in Your Skirt?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Nothing is what you think it is any more. Two great collections from Dries Van Noten and Undercover prove that's OK.
The sense that things are not as they seem, that all the recognizable signposts suddenly look different and the world as you know it has gone topsy-turvy, is currently an everyday lament. You can have an existential crisis about it, or you can use it as a fuel for creativity. Surrealism followed the First World War; abstract expressionism, the Second. Often the worst of times produces the most interesting art.
Or, in this case, confusing times make for great fashion.
As Dries Van Noten said backstage after a show that twisted, torqued and otherwise rendered alien many of the basic building blocks of the preppy wardrobe, it was about taking "things that you really know but done in a completely upside down, inside out, special, strange way." Acknowledging the way the familiar can be unfamiliar.
Jun Takahashi took it even further after a dazzling Undercover show that was essentially an elegy for a lost world (and lost friends, the designer added afterward through a translator), saying that sometimes you have to "delete everything" to start again.
The extraordinary thing about both collections was that they conveyed this dizzying sense of dislocation in such a graceful way. This wasn't about making, as Mr. Van Noten said, "sad clothes" (things are sad enough all on their own), or angry clothes (ditto). It was about asserting the possibility that out of the sadness comes hope for what's next. Not about losing your bearings but finding them in unexpected places -- and garments. Who wouldn't want to wear that?
Mr. Van Noten did it by using khakis and striped shirting, rugby shirts and denim, the utility materials of a wardrobe, and then repurposing them so they became something entirely new. One ankle-length trench -- that kind that would sweep in and out of a room -- was thrown over a knit leopard 1920s-era maillot worn with a crisp seaside-stripe shirt/cover-up: From the Croisette to the conference room in one dramatic entrance.
That same shirting became the trim on a navy sweatshirt that slouched off one shoulder, like a figment of the "Flashdance" past, and was worn with drawstring trousers in a mustard and faded red rugby stripe. The khaki was tied up in knots in the best way, to shape a day dress. Later, a baroque silk scarf print and some fish scale paillettes appeared in the mix, though most of the embellishment was left to the shoes, dripping in beads.
Mr. Van Noten has a knack for making tailoring look as lived-in as pajamas, and jeans seem as serious as a suit. In his hands, undermining assumptions (including about what qualifies as "comfort clothing") becomes a desirable thing.
Mr. Takahashi, meanwhile, took the suit, stripped it down to its innards and skeletal seams and then patched it back together out of objects and memories -- playing cards here, a straight edge there; a slice of a Chanel-style jacket here, feathery wings over there -- before trapping it all under a veil of filmy georgette (or some sort of georgette-like technical fabric), so each piece had an entire life beating just below the surface.
The same veiling turned shorts into trousers, like a scrim over the calves; shadowed sweatshirts and bomber jackets; and trailed behind tuxedo suiting (some shoulders speckled with spiders, spinning their own webs), like the wisps of a story once told. There were more life stories in the paintings of Neo Rauch, the German artist whose work merges autobiography and industrial alienation and was reproduced on suits and dresses. And more courtesy of the blank faces from Mr. Takahashi's own paintings, remade in skirts of densely packed frills.
At the end, four perky prom dresses with full plastic miniskirts appeared, illuminated from within to reveal whole gardens trapped beneath their domes: tiny dioramas of Eden, complete with flowers and live butterflies that flittered around. The butterflies would be set free after the show, Mr. Takahashi said. How's that for a metaphor?

Full text: Why do runway models always look miserable? They always look as if they would bite your head off if you spoke to them. What's wrong with smiling? Did they ever? And if so, when did things change?
Lisa, Baltimore Designers do sometimes ask their models to smile. Giorgio Armani did it this season for his Emporio Armani show. When she was alive, Sonia Rykiel used to do it all the time; she even had her models skip down the catwalk to add extra zest. And it is almost always ... terrifying.
The truth is, it's awfully hard to maintain a believable expression of great joy when you are walking in front of hundreds, if not thousands, of strangers, all there to render their judgment on what you are wearing. As a model, your shoes probably don't fit, since they are samples, and you are concentrating very hard to avoid slipping or falling, and you are modeling chiffon in winter or leather in September, and you are partially blinded by the flashes of a zillion photographers.
Besides, while clothes are meant to make consumers feel good, they should also make them feel safe, strong, confident, protected. Michael Kors used to have posters backstage scrawled with phrases like "own the room" and "walk like you mean it" to inspire his models. That kind of pantomiming doesn't always come with a beaming face. Smiling can make one seem like a supplicant, and fashion is supposed to make you feel powerful in your skin.
Little wonder, really, that when a happy face is required, it turns, very quickly, into a frozen rictus that doesn't reach the eyes -- a facial disjunction that can be very disturbing to watch. It's hard to concentrate on clothes when you are wondering if the woman who is wearing them has a knife secreted somewhere.
That is why Tyra Banks always instructed the contestants on "America's Next Top Model" to "smize," or "smile with your eyes." Smiling with your actual mouth for the length of a runway generally looks just plain weird.
Aside from a brief period in the 1970s when models like Pat Cleveland danced down the runways, or the moment in 1991 when the supermodels from George Michael's "Freedom!" strutted down the Versace runway lip-syncing to the song, or that time in 1993 when Naomi Campbell fell off her Vivienne Westwood platforms and couldn't help bursting into laughter, smiles have rarely been the runway expression of choice. Look at any vintage photo of a classic couture salon, like Chanel or Christian Dior, and the mannequins are entirely po-faced.
Remember: The absence of a smile is not the same thing as the absence of attitude.

A New Era of Prosperity for Greece: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It is one of Europe's fastest-growing economies, and while investors and tourists are flocking to the country, memories of austerity measures are still fresh for Greeks.
Paris Skouros pointed toward the sky outside his office in Athens on a recent weekday. In the past six months, four high-rises had sprung up, built by Greek and international builders to be sold for use as tourist rentals, foreign real estate investments and company offices. Farther afield, a fresh crop of new buildings dotted the horizon.
Greece's financial crisis almost ruined his firm, Skouros & Sons, an elevator company. Years of harsh austerity measures imposed by international bailouts had been wrenching, Mr. Skouros said, as new construction ground to a standstill. But now an economic recovery has barreled in.
"During the crisis, we just wanted to survive," Mr. Skouros said, as the sound of hammers hitting sheet metal rang out in his workshop. "Now we're profitable, and business is so strong that we can't find enough workers to keep up with demand."
Laden with debt it couldn't pay back, Greece nearly broke the eurozone a decade ago. Today, it is one of Europe's fastest-growing economies. In a significant acknowledgment of the country's turnaround, credit ratings agencies have been upgrading their appraisal of Greece's debt, and opening the door for large foreign investors.
The economy is growing at twice the eurozone average, and unemployment, while still high at 11 percent, is the lowest in over a decade. Tourists have returned in droves, fueling a construction frenzy and new jobs. Multinational companies, like Microsoft and Pfizer, are investing. And banks that almost collapsed have cleaned up and are lending again, benefiting the broader economy.
Greece still faces risks. Its mountain of debt has shrunk, but at 166 percent of the economy, it's among the world's highest. The country's banks still hold a pile of nonperforming loans that is bigger than the European average. And the misery of austerity is still fresh for some people, made worse by stubbornly high inflation stoked by Russia's war in Ukraine.
The country's prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a business-friendly conservative politician, was re-elected by a landslide in June after being credited with spurring a recovery by reducing taxes and debt. The government cut red tape for businesses and raised the minimum wage. The country is even paying back international bailout money ahead of schedule.
Mr. Mitsotakis hailed Greece's return to investors' graces. "I will never allow us to relive the trauma of a national bankruptcy," he said a day after the latest upgrade.
Greece became the center of Europe's debt crisis after Wall Street imploded in 2008. Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus were also forced to take international bailouts. But Greece had it the worst, requiring three rescue packages from 2010 to 2015, totaling 320 billion euros, or $ 343 billion, with bitter austerity terms. Household incomes and pensions were slashed. The economy shrank by a quarter, and hundreds of thousands of businesses collapsed as banks shuttered. By 2013, nearly a third of Greeks were unemployed.
"We would have liked the austerity to be milder, but the measures were the Greek contribution to saving itself," said Yannis Stournaras, a former finance minister who is the governor of Greece's central bank and a member of the European Central Bank board. "Greece had to take these tough steps to survive."
Greece exited the bailout programs' strict fiscal controls in 2018, and the government's actions since then have earned confidence from the European Union. In 2021, Brussels policymakers approved another €30 billion for climate investments in Greece, part of a broader effort to bolster E.U. economies after Covid-19 lockdowns.
This month, DBRS Morningstar, a global credit rating agency recognized by the European Central Bank, raised Greece's debt rating to investment grade, a move that opens the door for pensions and other big investors to buy bonds issued by the government. And that will lower borrowing costs for households, businesses and the government after the E.C.B. has been raising interest rates to fight inflation.
Moody's, one of the largest credit ratings agencies, raised Greece's debt rating on Sept. 15 by two notches, just short of investment grade, citing "profound structural change" in the country's economy, finances and banking system.
Investors are jumping in. Microsoft is building a €1 billion data center east of Athens. Farther north, Pfizer is anchoring a €650 million research hub. American, Chinese and European companies are pitching renewable-energy deals. And investments by Cisco, JPMorgan, Meta and other multinationals are projected to have an economic impact worth billions of euros over the next few years.
Well over 10 million tourists swarmed into Greece this summer despite a spate of wildfires, bringing estimated revenues of over €21 billion. Construction has climbed on the mainland and on popular Greek islands, driven by a surging demand for hotels, Airbnb rentals and a program that lets foreigners get a visa to live in E.U. states if they buy at least €500,000 in real estate in Greece.
The activity has buoyed businesses like the one run by Mr. Skouros. The company, which he manages with his brother, John, was founded by their father in 1965. When orders dried up during the economic crisis, they pulled through by servicing elevators they had already installed around Athens.
Today, it has orders for elevators in 10 buildings, up from none during the crisis and Covid lockdowns. At around €20,000 per elevator, the firm is profitable again. Mr. Skouros raised salaries 10 percent and hired five more employees. He needs more technicians, but in a hot economy, he is no longer finding takers.
The comeback is moving so quickly that Mr. Skouros is worried about a real estate bubble forming. So he is steering clear of new high-rise construction that he fears could go bust, and targeting smaller residential buildings with sound finances.
For others, the economic upturn has yet to heal the scars from austerity.
Dmitris Mitrofinakis, 67, has struggled to bounce back from shuttering the home décor store that he ran for over 40 years, after draining his personal savings during the crisis to try to salvage it. When he retired in 2015, the pension that he had long paid into was slashed to €1,300 a month from the €2,400 he was supposed to get.
"The austerity imposed on Greece was too strict," said Mr. Mitrofinakis, who lives in a modest apartment with his wife in a working-class neighborhood, adding that he has little money left at the end of the month.
He sees signs that the economy is improving. "When you look around, people have more work and higher salaries," Mr. Mitrofinakis said. "But a lot of other people haven't recovered," he said, adding that many of his retired neighbors are struggling to make ends meet.
Roula Skouros, a hotel manager in the city of Tripoli, doesn't expect Greece's investment grade rating to improve her life. "Someone who maybe works at the bank or at the stock market probably is affected, but I'm not," said Ms. Skouros, who is not related to Paris Skouros.
Her paycheck has always hovered around the minimum wage, she said. But with inflation running rampant at the gas pump and grocery store, an improved economy "doesn't mean anything if you can't afford gas and food," Ms. Skouros said.
In a recent speech, Mr. Mitsotakis acknowledged the challenges and vowed to spread the recovery's benefits more widely. "We're not hiding behind investment grade, saying, 'We achieved an important goal -- let's turn to autopilot,"' he said.
His government announced that it aimed to raise the monthly minimum wage to €950 by the end of its four-year term after lifting it to €780 in April. Public-sector salaries will also increase for the first time since a 20 percent cut during the crisis to pay Greece's debts.
For Konstantinos Kanderakis, 62, a supervisor at Greece's digital services agency, the gains are meaningful. He earns €1,300 a month after a 35-year career in government, and he will get a €100 monthly increase after a decade in which his income had fallen.
"It's a big psychological boost," he said. "Greece is stable again, and what I am happy about is that things will be better for my children."

Full text: The accessory harks back to the embroidery that has become synonymous with the fashion house.
On a trip to Monte Carlo in 1923, the French couturier Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel was introduced to Hugh Grosvenor, the second Duke of Westminster, with whom she began a decade-long love affair. The couple would go hunting and fishing at his 100,000-acre Reay Forest estate in the Scottish Highlands, where, on blustery days, the designer often borrowed the duke's tweed blazers. Eventually, she enlisted the Scottish mill Linton Tweeds to produce her own yardage and, having famously cast aside delicate crepes and muslins, she presented her first cardigan made from the nubby fabric. "I asked wholesalers for natural colors," she would later recall to the French novelist Paul Morand. "I wanted women to be guided by nature." Chanel's bouclé tweeds and tartan ensembles, which were made in monochrome as well as pastel palettes, became synonymous with her refined, ever-so-slightly rugged style.
Now, three years after releasing the first Tweed de Chanel high jewelry collection, the historic fashion house has created 63 new pieces inspired by five of its recurring icons: spools of white ribbon, camellias (the designer's favorite flower), comets, lions and the sun. One of the standouts is the Tweed Poudré, a brooch that can transform into a necklace when worn on a chain. At its center is a brilliant-cut diamond, encircled by an array of powder pink sapphires set against rose gold openwork that mimics the embroidery of tweed, as well as the shape of the camellia.

Reversal in Britain Favors Microsoft-Activision Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Satariano, Adam

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Britain's antitrust regulator said the companies had addressed its main concerns about the $ 69 billion deal, though final approval is yet to come.
Microsoft came one step closer on Friday to completing its $ 69 billion purchase of the video game maker Activision Blizzard, in a deal that has become an example of how a company can successfully ride out stricter regulatory scrutiny of the power of tech giants.
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, the last remaining agency that must sign off before Microsoft can complete the acquisition, said the companies had taken action that "substantially addresses" remaining antitrust concerns. The regulator initially tried to block the deal, saying it would undercut competition, but reversed course after Microsoft agreed not to buy a part of Activision's business associated with so-called cloud gaming, a small but promising new area for the industry.
First announced in January 2022, the acquisition has been heavily scrutinized by antitrust officials around the world and held up as a test of whether regulators would approve a tech megamerger amid concerns about the industry's power. The deal would upend the video game market, combining Microsoft's Xbox business with Activision, a publisher of such hit video games as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.
But Microsoft, with experience in thorny antitrust disputes going back to the 1990s, was able to navigate its way through stiff regulatory resistance on both sides of the Atlantic. In July, the company won a court battle against the Federal Trade Commission, which had tried to block the deal. The European Union, typically an aggressive regulator of American tech firms, cleared the deal in May.
"Microsoft was very strategic in its approach in how it played the whole process from beginning to end," said Ioannis Kokkoris, professor of competition law and economics at Queen Mary, University of London.
He said that it was incredibly rare for Britain's C.M.A. to reverse course and that the agency had faced a lot of pressure to approve the deal after it cleared hurdles in other jurisdictions.
"When you are the last man standing, you cannot realistically block a deal when the U.K. represents less that 5 percent of the global revenues," said Tommaso Valletti, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School who used to work on antitrust cases for the European Commission.
On Friday, British regulators said Microsoft had satisfied their concerns. The C.M.A. initially blocked the deal because, it said, a merger between the maker of a top-selling console with the publisher of hit games threatened to stunt the development of the emerging area of cloud gaming technology. Although still a very small market, the technology allows people to stream games on phones, tablets and other devices, diminishing the need for traditional consoles.
Microsoft agreed to transfer the cloud streaming licensing rights for all current and new Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher. The arrangement lasts for 15 years, a move seen as preventing Microsoft from releasing Activision games exclusively on its own streaming service.
"The C.M.A. considers that the restructured deal makes important changes that substantially address the concerns it set out in relation to the original transaction earlier this year," the agency said in a statement on Friday.
The regulator said it was now holding a "consultation" through Oct. 6 about the remedies Microsoft had proposed before making a final decision on whether to approve the deal.
"We are encouraged by this positive development in the C.M.A.'s review process," Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said in a statement. "We look forward to working with Microsoft toward completing the regulatory review process," Activision Blizzard said in a statement.
The companies have said they intend to close the deal by Oct. 18.
Government scrutiny of the tech industry's growing power shows no signs of slowing down. This month, a trial began over claims by the U.S. Justice Department and a group of states that Google abused its power in the online search market. On Friday, E.U. regulators said they would reimpose a $ 400 million fine against Intel for abusing its power in the market for semiconductors. E.U. authorities are also investigating Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft for other anticompetitive business practices.
Mr. Kokkoris said Microsoft's mix of fighting in court and offering business concessions provided a playbook for other tech companies to follow when making large acquisitions.
"This is definitely going to make Big Tech more willing to continue deal making, but the companies know now that they will have to give up something more than they thought before this case," he said.
This week, Cisco agreed to buy the cybersecurity company Splunk for $ 28 billion. Broadcom, the semiconductor giant, is also getting closer to completing an acquisition of the software company VMware for $ 61 billion.

Cisco Will Buy Splunk, a Software Company That Analyzes Data, for $28 Billion in Cash: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The largest deal Cisco has ever announced moves it further away from its roots in network hardware and into higher-margin software subscriptions.
Cisco agreed on Thursday to buy Splunk, a data-analysis software company, for $ 28 billion in cash, as technology giants continue to look to acquisitions as a way to grow -- particularly in hot sectors like artificial intelligence.
The deal is the largest ever announced by Cisco, a longtime buyer of smaller tech companies, and suggests the company is willing to test antitrust officials' growing opposition to big-ticket mergers and acquisitions.
Founded in 2003, Splunk -- whose name refers to spelunking, or cave exploration -- focuses on mining its customers' data for insights, particularly on security vulnerabilities and other trends in their business. This summer, Splunk announced a flurry of A.I.-infused services meant to help companies detect and respond to potential issues more quickly.
Cisco said it planned to combine Splunk's capabilities with its own security offerings, including the monitoring of customers' network data, web traffic and emails.
"I consistently heard from our customers the strategic importance of what Splunk does," Chuck Robbins, the Cisco chief executive, said in an interview. Combining Splunk's systems with the information collected from Cisco's, he said, presented an "opportunity to bring a level of insight that's unmatched."
Gary Steele, the Splunk chief executive, added that Cisco's bigger sales footprint would help his company sell its products more widely, especially internationally. Mr. Steele is set to stay on as a member of Cisco's leadership team when the transaction closes, which is expected by the fall of next year.
The deal moves Cisco further away from its roots in network hardware and into higher-margin, more predictable software subscriptions.
Much of Cisco's push into software is being driven by acquisitions: The company has announced eight takeovers this year, according to S&P Capital IQ.
By some measures, Cisco is paying a high price. The transaction valued Splunk at $ 157 a share, a 31 percent premium to where its stock closed on Wednesday and 25 percent above the company's 52-week high. (Cisco had held discussions to buy Splunk early last year.)
Shares in Cisco fell 4 percent after the deal was announced. Shares in Splunk rose on the news, but still traded below the acquisition offer price, suggesting investors were somewhat skeptical that the deal would be completed. Among the potential concerns is whether antitrust regulators will approve the transaction, given increased scrutiny of big mergers by the Biden administration.
Privately, corporate executives have said recent setbacks for regulators, including defeats for the Federal Trade Commission's effort to block Microsoft's $ 70 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, could make it easier to do deals.
Mr. Robbins expressed confidence in the Cisco-Splunk deal's clearing antitrust hurdles, because there is little overlap in the companies' products.

With Interest Rates High, Wall Street Continues to Fall: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/with-interest-rates-high-wall-street-continues/docview/2867005607/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street fell sharply Thursday in an ugly day for stocks worldwide on expectations that U.S. interest rates will stay high well into next year.
The S&P 500 lost 1.6 percent for its worst day since March. That followed a drop of 0.9 percent from Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it may cut interest rates next year by just half of what it had earlier predicted. The Fed has already raised its main interest rate to levels unseen since 2001, which helps slow inflation, but at the cost of hurting investment prices.
High-growth stocks are typically among the hardest hit by high rates, and Big Tech stocks took the brunt of the pain for a second straight day. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.8 percent as Amazon fell 4.4 percent, Nvidia dropped 2.9 percent and Telsa lost 2.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.1 percent.
Stock prices tend to fall when rates rise because stocks are riskier investments. Why stomach the chance of their big swings when Treasurys are paying more in interest than before? And they're paying much more.
A 10-year Treasury is offering a yield of 4.48 percent, up from 4.40 percent late Wednesday and from only 0.50 percent three years ago. It's near its highest level since 2007.
The two-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, wavered after some mixed reports on the economy. It slipped to 5.14 percent from 5.17 percent late Wednesday after climbing earlier in the morning.
One report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. It was the lowest number since January and the latest signal of a remarkably resilient job market.
Such a solid labor market helps calm worries about a possible recession. But it may also give U.S. households fuel to keep spending, which could encourage companies to try to raise prices further and keep upward pressure on inflation. That in turn could give the Fed more reason to keep rates higher for longer.
A separate report, meanwhile, suggested manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is contracting by much more than economists expected. A third report showed sales of previously occupied U.S. homes were weaker last month than economists expected.
Manufacturing and the housing industry have felt the sting of higher interest rates in particular and have struggled more than the broad job market.
Interest rates may stay high if the Federal Reserve follows through on the latest forecasts from its policymaking officials.
Policymakers have indicated they could raise the federal funds rate one more time this year, then cut it by only half a percentage point from there through 2024. Three months ago, Fed officials were forecasting a full percentage point of cuts could be the most likely path. They want to ensure that inflation gets back down to the Fed's target of 2 percent.
Wednesday's projections may be an indication that "raises the bar for rate cuts next year," according to the Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle. He pushed out his forecast for the first cut in interest rates to the final three months of 2024 after earlier thinking it could happen during the spring.
High rates slow the economy by design and raise the pressure across the financial world. Earlier this spring, they helped lead to three high-profile collapses of U.S. banks. They also hurt prices for all kinds of investments. The hardest hit tend to be those bid up on hopes for big growth far out in the future. That's why tech stocks often swing in particular with expectations for rates.
Cisco Systems also took a hit after it said it would buy Splunk, a cybersecurity company, for roughly $ 28 billion in cash. Cisco fell 3.9%, while Splunk jumped 20.8%.
On the winning side of Wall Street, FedEx rose 4.5% after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Charles Gayle, Whose Saxophone Wailed Like a Preacher, Dies at 84: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An intense and uncompromising player, he made music that one critic said was more about "motion and spirit" than tonal centers, rhythms and melodies.
Charles Gayle, an uncompromising saxophonist who spent years living and performing on the streets of New York before beginning a recording career when he was nearly 50, died on Sept. 5 in Brooklyn. He was 84.
His son Ekwambu, who had been caring for him as he dealt with Alzheimer's disease, announced the death but did not specify a cause.
Mr. Gayle said he had chosen to be homeless because it gave him the opportunity to explore music unencumbered by worries about changing tastes or living expenses. He was part of an ecstatic lineage of jazz avant-gardists like late-period John Coltrane and Albert Ayler, purveyors of a style often referred to as "fire music."
Mr. Gayle's playing was eventually documented on nearly 40 albums under his name on a host of labels; he also recorded with the pianist Cecil Taylor, the bassist William Parker and the punk singer Henry Rollins.
Reviewing the 2014 Vision Festival, at which Mr. Gayle was given a lifetime achievement award, the New York Times music critic Ben Ratliff wrote, "He plays tenor saxophone in cries and gabbles and interval jumps and long tones; his music usually describes motion and spirit rather than corresponding to preset tonal centers, rhythms and melodies."
An ardent Christian, Mr. Gayle did not only channel his intense spirituality into his sound; it was also reflected in the titles of many of his albums, and in the screeds he delivered extemporaneously during his performances.
Mr. Gayle also had an alternate musical persona called Streets: He would dress in a torn suit and clown shoes and wear makeup and a red nose. At first it was an occasional diversion, but he later performed as Streets regularly. In a 2014 interview with The New York City Jazz Record, he explained:
"It wasn't a gimmick or anything like that. I looked at myself one day in the mirror and said to myself, 'Stop thinking about Charles.' So I put a rubber nose on and said 'That'll work.'
"It was really that simple," he continued. "I saw a lot of clowns when I was young in the circus, but it was so liberating to go out in an audience while the band is playing and give a lady a rose or get rejected by her and everything -- I can't do that with regular clothes on. It helps a person mentally to escape -- there's a purpose in the escape, and it is the same thing as being in the music and trying to get past certain things. In order for me to do that I had to disappear."
Charles Ennis Gayle Jr. was born on Feb. 28, 1939, in Buffalo, N.Y., to Charles and Frances Gayle. His father was a steelworker. He studied numerous instruments in high school and excelled in basketball and track and field.
After a period at Fredonia State Teachers College, Mr. Gayle returned to Buffalo to begin his music career. He first played trumpet and piano in local clubs before concentrating more on tenor saxophone in self-produced concerts, while also working at a Westinghouse factory and later at a bank providing loans for Black-owned businesses.
From 1970 to 1973, Mr. Gayle was an assistant professor of music at the State University of New York at Buffalo (now the University at Buffalo). But, tiring of institutional responsibilities, he left academia and moved to New York City to pursue music exclusively. He had been there for almost a decade when he decided to live on the streets.
In the 2014 interview, he recalled: "I just walked out one day and that was it. That was one of the greatest experiences I had in my life, though I didn't do it for that reason. You have nothing and you're not asking anybody for anything. We seek security, and you learn about how people perceive you because of what you look like or what they think you're about."
He had music ready for release by ESP-Disk, Mr. Ayler's label from 1964 to 1966, but those plans were scuttled when the company went out of business in 1975. (That session has yet to be heard, but the label was revived in 2005 and released a 1994 performance by Mr. Gayle's trio in 2012.)
Mr. Gayle spent more than 15 years homeless, performing on the streets of New York. Then, in 1987, he began his second act.
After the promoter Michael Dorf heard Mr. Gayle play, he was booked regularly at Mr. Dorf's Lower Manhattan club, the Knitting Factory. Music he recorded at sessions in April 1988 became three albums for the Swedish label Silkheart Records. From 1991 onward, Mr. Gayle would steadily release albums under his own name -- some as the leader of a trio or quartet, others as a solo performer -- among them "Repent," "Consecration," "Testaments," "Daily Bread" and "Christ Everlasting."
In a 2013 interview with Cadence magazine, he reflected on the perils of being outspoken about his religious beliefs, which included rants against homosexuality and abortion that he delivered at his concerts with the fervor of a country preacher:
"People have told me to shut up and stuff. I understand that I can turn people off with what I say or do. The problem that people have with me is not me, it's Christ they have a problem with. I understand that when you start speaking about faith or religion, they want you to keep it in a box, but I'm not going to do that. Not because I'm taking advantage of being a musician; I'm the same everywhere, and people have to understand that."
Mr. Gayle also had a notable collaborative group with Mr. Parker and the drummer Rashied Ali and was a guest on two albums by Henry Rollins. In addition to tenor saxophone, he played alto and soprano saxophones, piano, viola, upright bass and drums. He is seen and heard in an interview and playing with the German bassist Peter Kowald's trio in a 1985 documentary, "Rising Tones Cross," produced and directed by his former wife Ebba Jahn.
A biography of Mr. Gayle by Cisco Bradley, with all proceeds going to the Gayle family, is scheduled for publication in late 2024.
Mr. Gayle's three marriages all ended in divorce. In addition to his son Ekwambu, from his second marriage, his survivors include two other sons, Michael, from the first, and Dwayne, from his marriage to Ms. Jahn; and a granddaughter.
The drummer Michael Wimberley, who worked with Mr. Gayle from the early 1990s well into the new millennium, called him "a father, mentor and friend whom I had the pleasure of creating some of the most adventurous improvised sounds, shapes and musical dialogues with."
"Charles's intensity on the horn," he added, "was so powerful in person. I had never experienced anything like music of that intensity before! He pulled me into the sonic center of his sound and raptured me."

California May Be First In U.S. to Ban Caste Bias: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The bill, which was passed by the State Legislature this week, has led to intense debate among South Asian immigrants.
Ramesh Suman, a real estate agent in Antioch, Calif., remembers the client who refused to see a house after saying that it looked like it belonged to members of the Dalit community, a historically oppressed group of people relegated below even the lowest rung of the caste hierarchy once predominant in South Asia.
Bhim Narayan Bishwakarma recalled how a landlord accepted his deposit but later reneged on a rental after learning his surname, which is common among Nepalese Dalit families.
And Dr. Promila Dhanuka said that once word got around more than 15 years ago in Redding, Calif., that she had Dalit roots, some Indian American doctors stopped referring patients to her oncology practice.
While many South Asian immigrants face discrimination in the United States, those with Dalit ancestry -- once deemed to be "untouchable" from birth -- say they must also overcome being ostracized by fellow South Asian immigrants who cling to a social stratification that dates back millenniums. That has occurred even though untouchability and caste-based discrimination have been outlawed in India and Nepal for decades.
Nowhere in the United States has the subject been as prominent -- or as divisive -- as in California. Three years ago, the state's Civil Rights Department accused two engineers of caste discrimination at Cisco Systems in a landmark lawsuit. This week, the State Legislature sent a bill to Gov. Gavin Newsom that could make California the first state to expressly prohibit such bias.
In more than a dozen interviews, people who identify as Dalits described various encounters with caste-based bigotry in the United States, in the form of wage theft, housing discrimination, mistreatment in the workplace and social exclusion.
They spoke of the shame and anger they felt hearing slurs used in reference to Dalits. Many said that they felt pressure to hide their identity and that they lived in constant fear of being "outed," despite being in a country they saw as a haven free of the caste vestiges of their homelands.
"I really thought I had left untouchability or caste-based discrimination back in Nepal," said Mr. Bishwakarma, who works at a convenience store in El Cerrito, Calif. "I never thought that one day I would be discriminated against just on the basis of caste in a country like the U.S."
The issue has prompted fierce debate over how pervasive caste discrimination is within the South Asian community in America, which has grown dramatically in recent years and reached around 5.4 million people. Those who oppose an express ban say they believe such discrimination is rare and that writing it into state law will unfairly malign South Asian Americans by associating them with antiquated social beliefs.
In California, many community members have faced off against one another at the State Capitol and various City Council chambers, showing how immigrant communities can become factionalized as they expand and become more diverse.
Since 1965, most South Asians who have immigrated to the United States have been highly educated people who could trace their origins to the upper caste, in part because they had greater access to the resources necessary to qualify for skilled worker visas.
But the makeup of South Asian immigrants has changed in recent years, particularly among those from India, where affirmative action has enabled more people from oppressed communities to attend universities and move abroad.
While conditions generally have improved in South Asia for those who were once relegated to the lowest tiers, segregation based on caste remains persistent, and many people of Dalit background still face discrimination, mistreatment and violence.
Most Americans are unaware of the caste distinctions in South Asia, and the Cisco lawsuit served as a wake-up call to Democratic lawmakers in California. The issue is especially acute in the tech industry, where South Asians comprise a significant share of Silicon Valley workers, many of them first-generation immigrants.
"The more diverse California becomes, the more diverse our laws have to be and the further we have to go to protect more people," Aisha Wahab, a Democratic state senator who introduced the caste discrimination bill, said in an interview. Senator Wahab is the first Afghan American elected to the State Legislature and the first Muslim to serve in the State Senate.
Opposition to the bill has been driven by some Hindu residents and organizations, who have been vocal throughout the year. They argue that the proposal unfairly targets Hindus because the caste system is most commonly associated with Hinduism.
They also say that existing laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of religion and ancestry are sufficient, while pointing out that caste discrimination was outlawed in India more than 70 years ago.
"I personally see this as something that does not exist in society," said Praveen Sinha, a professor of accounting at California State University, Long Beach, who filed a lawsuit last year challenging the university system's addition of caste to its discrimination policy.
Opponents say that expressly naming caste as a protected characteristic disproportionately makes South Asians more vulnerable to unfair accusations of discrimination for actions that may have nothing to do with caste. They see redemption in the state dropping its case against the two managers at the heart of the Cisco case, though its lawsuit against the company is still ongoing.
The State Legislature, in an attempt to address such concerns, amended Senator Wahab's bill this summer to make caste a subset of ancestry discrimination rather than its own class. But that did not satisfy critics. Some say that writing caste into state law will draw greater attention to outdated South Asian distinctions rather than dissolve them.
"We are all in America now and our kids are second- and third-generation," said Samir Kalra, managing director for policy and programs at the Hindu American Foundation, one of the organizations leading the opposition. "As immigrants, we want to create a better society and lifestyle and leave all these issues behind."
It is difficult to know how widespread caste discrimination is in the United States. A 2020 survey of Indian Americans conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace found that only 5 percent of respondents reported having encountered caste discrimination. The same survey found that Hindus born outside the country were significantly more likely than U.S.-born respondents to identify with a caste group.
Some people with Dalit ancestry have said they are hesitant to report discrimination for fear that it could jeopardize their visa status in the United States or invite retaliation. The bill's proponents point out that caste bias is not confined to Hinduism, and is present in other religious communities.
"It's not that caste is something that has just popped up," said Sangay Mishra, an associate professor of political science at Drew University and the author of "Desis Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans." "As culture travels from India to the diaspora, as language travels, as cuisine travels, so does caste. We are just talking about a different scale now."
Feelings remain intense on both sides of the bill. Proponents started a hunger strike this week that they said would last until Governor Newsom signed the legislation. Opponents have started a recall drive against Senator Wahab.
On a recent weekday, dozens of people, most of them first-generation immigrants, gathered at the State Capitol to rally in support of the bill. The group listened carefully as Thenmozhi Soundararajan, the founder of Equality Labs, a Dalit civil rights organization, coached them on how to answer questions about the measure. A picnic of chapati and chai waited on the grass nearby.
Backers have acknowledged that existing laws can be used to fight caste discrimination. But they say an explicit definition in state law would provide greater assurance for victims who want to speak out. And they believe that the bill would raise broader awareness about such bias and how it may surface -- that questions about one's dietary habits or parents' occupations may be more than a matter of personal curiosity.
Among the supporters was Sunita Singh. Since moving to the United States from India in the early 1980s, Ms. Singh said she and her family had faced more discrimination based on race than on caste. She recalled how, after the Sept. 11 attacks, her son's locker was glued shut at his high school because classmates thought he was Muslim.
But Ms. Singh said that caste discrimination was a problem, too. Not long after she arrived in America, members of her Ravidassia religious community, which has Dalit roots, were asked to use separate pots and pans at the Sikh temple that they had been renting in Central California.
For Ms. Singh and others in her group, the request evoked the practice, still found in parts of India, of having people of Dalit lineage eat with separate cups and plates to prevent them from "polluting" those used by higher castes.
The incident decades ago became the impetus for Ms. Singh and the other Ravidassia to establish their own temple. There are now six Ravidassia temples in California, and the community has been among the most vocal backers of the bill banning caste discrimination.
"We don't want to be treated in this country any different than other Americans," Ms. Singh said. "We want to be treated like humans."

Hybrid work around the world: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In London, a politician wrote not-so-subtle notes to remote workers last year, hoping to persuade them to spend more time in the office: "Sorry you were out when I visited," Jacob Rees-Mogg, then a government minister, recalled writing in messages left on the desks of Cabinet Office staff members who were working from home.
In Seoul, Jem Kim, who started a new job at a private equity firm, hoped to ask for permission to work some days from home, but she quickly learned that she would need to be in the office full time.
And in San Mateo, Calif., executives at Sequoia, a human resources technology company, said that although they had not mandated a return to office for most employees, they had tried to make the office environment so close-knit that people couldn't help but feel "major FOMO" (fear of missing out) when they joined meetings by videoconference.
When the coronavirus pandemic began in 2020, many industries around the world shifted to remote or hybrid work. It was an experiment that yielded different results for different cities -- with long-term standoffs between executives and workers in some cases, and a sweeping return to the office in others.
Levels of remote work have varied across regions based on factors like housing density, length of Covid lockdowns and cultural norms about how much workers can fight for workplace autonomy, according to interviews with nearly two dozen workers and executives, as well as a study that included researchers at Stanford, Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México and the Ifo Institute, who surveyed more than 42,000 workers in 34 countries.
Whether a person is more likely to work at a cubicle in a big office tower or on a couch in their living room depends on where in the world those cubicles and couches are. Many Asian countries have lower levels of remote work than countries in Europe and North America. Those with the highest levels are Britain, Canada and the United States.
In the United States and Britain, workers across industries spent five to six paid days a month this spring working from home, according to the study. Other European countries had slightly lower levels of remote work, with Germans at four days per month. Asia's work-from-home levels were the lowest, with South Koreans working less than two days per month remotely, Japan two and Taiwan under three.
The researchers think housing plays a role in return-to-office patterns. In suburban parts of the United States, where people have larger homes and sometimes home offices, workers have been slower to go back to the office. In densely populated cities, particularly in Asia, return-to-office rates have tended to be higher, often because people struggled to be productive in small apartments shared with many family members.
Commute vs. Productivity
"It's really hard to work from home if you live with a partner and have a one-bedroom apartment," said Jose Maria Barrero, an economist at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, or ITAM, who helped lead the global study. "Tokyo, for example, is a place where apartments are quite modest."
Executives managing work forces that sprawl across continents have noticed the regional variability firsthand. Jeetu Patel, an executive vice president and general manager at the technology company Cisco, which has nearly 85,000 employees, traveled to Asia recently and found that his company's offices there, as well as those of its customers, were more bustling than offices in other countries. Cisco has let its teams across the globe determine their own approach to hybrid work.
Mr. Patel, who lives in Los Altos, Calif., said he preferred to work from home when he did not have in-office meetings so he could spare himself an hour traveling to San Jose and back.
"I can take that 30 minutes going back and forth commuting and I can have more things I get done," he said. "I like having dinner with my daughter."
Daan van Rossum, chief executive of FlexOS, a company in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, that creates digital solutions for remote managers, thought extensively about employees' home setups when considering his company's approach to hybrid work.
"A lot of people here don't have their own places," he said. "Working from home at the kitchen table with three generations running around is not the best environment to be productive."
This year, Mr. van Rossum asked his employees to begin working in the office at least two days a week. He tried to make the experience enjoyable by carving out time for levity. Every meeting starts with a nonwork-related icebreaker, like a game of telephone.
Beyond housing differences, researchers said, remote work levels are affected by the amount of time a region spent in Covid lockdowns. In areas of the world that lurched in and out of lockdowns repeatedly, like some American cities, workers and employers became more settled in remote work routines. People invested in comfortable setups at home, buying computer monitors and ergonomic chairs. Companies set up management systems that ensured bosses would measure performance by employee output, not by the amount of time people spent at the office.
Where Remote Never Took Hold
That kind of long-term investment in hybrid work came in handy in 2021 and 2022, as many companies delayed return-to-office plans because of infectious coronavirus variants.
"People realized, 'Hey, you know what, I can be just as productive and effective working remotely as I can being in the same location as the rest of my co-workers,"' said Dawn Klinghoffer, head of people analytics at Microsoft, which has required employees to return to the office 50 percent of the time, with more flexibility for those who need it.
In parts of Asia, remote work routines did not become as entrenched. "There were many countries in Asia that controlled early waves of Covid pretty well without extended lockdowns," Mr. Barrero of ITAM said. "They didn't have this experience where they had to hunker down for months on end working from home and get adapted to it."
In South Korea, for example, many workers never left their offices. "We've never implemented work from home," said Joori Roh, a spokeswoman for SK Hynix, a major chip maker, adding that the company did not like the idea of giving some workers a privilege that was not available to all.
In Japan, workers still routinely use fax machines, and sometimes a personal stamp known as a hanko, which requires someone to be in the office. Some corporate managers in Tokyo said being together in the same space helped them keep an eye on the people who reported to them.
"Sometimes, I get very worried about whether they are actually working," said Ryuichi Takezawa, who manages some 30 employees at Astellas Pharma in Tokyo. In the office, he said, he can ask his team questions: "How are you feeling? What are you stressed about? What can I support you with?"
Do Employees Have a Say?
The researchers of the remote-work study said cultural norms are also a factor in return-to-work levels. Plenty of American workers said they felt comfortable asking their managers for more flexibility, or even telling them that they would quit without it.
When Laura Zimm, a public defender in Duluth, Minn., was called back to the office last year, she immediately came down with Covid. She worked from home during and after her sickness, and eventually decided with her manager that she would stay permanently remote, which Ms. Zimm preferred and which gave her manager more flexibility with office space.
At Microsoft, the return-to-office process has often included "team agreements," in which managers meet with employees to discuss hybrid work preferences.
In parts of Europe, unions and other worker associations have helped shape return-to-office policies. At many German firms, for example, employee-elected councils negotiated with managers on the details of hybrid work.
"We needed to find a solution that would work for all of our employees, whether in software development, finance or on the shop floor," said Julia Bangerth, head of human resources at Datev, a software company in Nuremberg that allows every team to set its own return-to-office expectations.
And the choices that individual employers make are not isolated. In areas of the world where remote or hybrid work has become a norm, employers with strict return-to-office policies worry about retaining talent, said Mark Ein, chairman of the workplace security firm Kastle, which has tracked American office occupancy levels with its "Back to Work Barometer."
"Business leaders as a group have wanted people to come back in much more profound ways," Mr. Ein said. "It really is the labor market's competitive pressures and some cultural norms that have prevented it."
"The desire to get people back among business managers is nearly universal," he added. "It's the ability to do it that varies across countries."

In areas of the world where remote or hybrid work has become a norm, employers with strict return-to-office policies worry about retaining talent, said Mark Ein, chair of the workplace security firm Kastle, which has tracked U.S. office occupancy levels with its “Back to Work Barometer.”
“Business leaders as a group have wanted people to come back in much more profound ways,” Ein said. “It really is the labor market’s competitive pressures and some cultural norms that have prevented it.”
“The desire to get people back among business managers is nearly universal,” he added. “It’s the ability to do it that varies across countries.”

Where in the World Are Workers in the Office?: [None]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A city's density, the size of people's homes and cultural norms are among the factors that affect hybrid work patterns.
In London, a politician wrote not-so-subtle notes to remote workers last year, hoping to persuade them to spend more time in the office: "Sorry you were out when I visited," Jacob Rees-Mogg, then a government minister, recalled writing in messages left on the desks of Cabinet Office staff members who were working from home.
In Seoul, Jem Kim, who started a new job at a private equity firm, hoped to ask for permission to work some days from home, but quickly learned she had to be in the office full time.
And in San Mateo, Calif., executives at Sequoia, a human resources technology company, said that though they had not mandated a return to office for most employees, they had tried to make the office environment so close-knit that people couldn't help but feel "major FOMO" (fear of missing out) when they joined meetings by videoconference.
When the coronavirus pandemic took hold in 2020, many industries across the world shifted to remote or hybrid work. It was an immense experiment that yielded different results for different cities -- with long-term standoffs between executives and workers in some cases, and a sweeping return to the office in others.
Levels of remote work have varied across regions based on factors like housing density, length of Covid lockdowns and cultural norms surrounding how much workers can fight for workplace autonomy, according to interviews with nearly two dozen workers and executives, as well as a study that included researchers at Stanford, Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México and the Ifo Institute, who surveyed more than 42,000 workers in 34 countries.
Whether a person is more likely to do work at a cubicle in a big office tower or on the living room couch now depends on where in the world those cubicles and couches are. Many Asian countries have lower levels of remote work than countries in Europe and North America. Those with the highest levels are Britain, Canada and the United States.
In the United States and Britain, workers across industries spent five to six paid days a month this spring working from home, according to the study. Other European countries had slightly lower levels of remote work, with Germans at four days per month across industries. Asia's work-from-home levels were the lowest, with South Koreans working less than two days per month remotely, Japan two and Taiwan under three.
The researchers think housing plays a role in return-to-office patterns. In suburban parts of the United States, where people have larger homes and sometimes home offices, workers have been slower to go back to the office. Densely populated cities, particularly in Asia, have tended to see higher return-to-office rates, often because people struggled to be productive in small apartments shared with many family members.
"It's really hard to work from home if you live with a partner and have a one-bedroom apartment," said Jose Maria Barrero, an economist at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, or ITAM, who helped lead the global study. "Tokyo, for example, is a place where apartments are quite modest."
Executives managing work forces that sprawl across continents have noticed the regional variability firsthand. Jeetu Patel, an executive vice president and general manager at the technology company Cisco, which has nearly 85,000 employees, traveled to Asia recently and found that his company's offices there, as well as those of its customers, were more bustling than offices in other countries. Cisco has let its teams across the globe determine their own approach to hybrid work.
Mr. Patel, who lives in Los Altos, Calif., said he preferred to work from home when he did not have in-office meetings so he could spare himself an hour traveling to San Jose and back.
"I can take that 30 minutes going back and forth commuting and I can have more things I get done," he said. "I like having dinner with my daughter."
Daan van Rossum, chief executive of FlexOS, a company in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, that creates digital solutions for remote managers, thought extensively about employees' home setups when considering his company's approach to hybrid work.
"A lot of people here don't have their own places," he said. "Working from home at the kitchen table with three generations running around is not the best environment to be productive."
This year, Mr. van Rossum asked his employees to begin working in the office at least two days a week. He tried to make the experience enjoyable by carving out time for levity. Every meeting starts with a nonwork-related icebreaker, like a game of telephone.
Beyond housing differences, researchers said, remote work levels are affected by the amount of time a region spent in Covid lockdowns. In areas of the world that lurched in and out of lockdowns repeatedly, like some American cities, workers and employers became more settled in remote work routines. People invested in comfortable setups at home, buying large computer monitors and ergonomic chairs. Companies set up management systems that ensured bosses would measure performance by employee output, not by the amount of time people spent at the office.
That kind of long-term investment in hybrid work came in handy in 2021 and 2022, as many companies delayed return-to-office plans because of infectious coronavirus variants.
"People realized, 'Hey, you know what, I can be just as productive and effective working remotely as I can being in the same location as the rest of my co-workers,"' said Dawn Klinghoffer, head of people analytics at Microsoft, which has required employees to return to the office 50 percent of the time, with more flexibility for those who need it.
In parts of Asia, remote work routines did not become as entrenched. "There were many countries in Asia that controlled early waves of Covid pretty well without extended lockdowns," Mr. Barrero of ITAM said. "They didn't have this experience where they had to hunker down for months on end working from home and get adapted to it."
In South Korea, for example, many workers never left their offices. "We've never implemented work from home," said Joori Roh, a spokeswoman for SK Hynix, a major chip maker, adding that the company did not like the idea of giving some workers a privilege that was not available to all.
In Japan, workers still routinely use fax machines, and sometimes a personal stamp known as a hanko, which requires someone to be in the office. Some corporate managers in Tokyo said being together in the same space helped them keep an eye on the people who reported to them.
"Sometimes, I get very worried about whether they are actually working," said Ryuichi Takezawa, who manages some 30 employees at Astellas Pharma in Tokyo. In the office, he said, he can ask his team questions: "How are you feeling? What are you stressed about? What can I support you with?"
The researchers of the remote-work study believe cultural norms are also at play in return-to-work levels. Plenty of American workers said they felt comfortable asking their managers for more flexibility, or even telling them that they would quit without it.
When Laura Zimm, a public defender in Duluth, Minn., was called back to the office last year, she immediately came down with Covid. She worked from home during and after her sickness, and eventually decided with her manager that she would stay permanently remote, which Ms. Zimm preferred and which gave her manager more flexibility with office space.
At Microsoft, the return-to-office process has often included "team agreements," in which managers meet with employees to discuss hybrid work preferences.
In parts of Europe, unions and other worker associations have helped shape return-to-office policies. At many German firms, for example, employee-elected councils negotiated with managers on the details of hybrid work.
"We needed to find a solution that would work for all of our employees, whether in software development, finance or on the shop floor," said Julia Bangerth, head of human resources at Datev, a software company in Nuremberg that allows every team to set its own return-to-office expectations.
And the choices that individual employers make are not isolated. In areas of the world where remote or hybrid work has become a norm, employers with strict return-to-office policies worry about retaining talent, said Mark Ein, chairman of the workplace security firm Kastle, which has tracked American office occupancy levels with its "Back to Work Barometer."
"Business leaders as a group have wanted people to come back in much more profound ways," Mr. Ein said. "It really is the labor market's competitive pressures and some cultural norms that have prevented it."
"The desire to get people back among business managers is nearly universal," he added. "It's the ability to do it that varies across countries."

Job Hopping Looks Bad on the Résumé. Gen Z Doesn't Care.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Repeatedly switching jobs has long been a red flag for employers. That's changing as Gen Z and younger Millennials embrace the upsides, but downsides persist.
Pranav Ravikumar has held three jobs since college, and he's only 24. One month after graduating in December 2020, he cycled through two rotations of a management training program at the pharmaceutical company Abbott. Mr. Ravikumar became an e-commerce analyst, but he wanted the kind of faster-paced work found at consulting firms and start-ups. The job at Abbott also required him to move to Columbus, Ohio, far from family and friends in Washington, D.C.
In October 2021, Mr. Ravikumar left Abbott for a remote job with Dragonfly, a start-up that acquires and develops small e-commerce businesses, and moved back to Washington. A few months in, he spoke to his manager about becoming more involved with strategy, but nothing changed. So a year later, Mr. Ravikumar began job hunting. This February, he started a job in product marketing at Alma, a membership network that helps mental health care providers build their practices.
For Mr. Ravikumar, this kind of rapid job hopping has been a positive experience. "I've almost doubled what my starting salary was at Abbott, and that's important to me," he said. "I really wanted the flexibility of remote work and I'd be hard-pressed now to give that up. And I've gotten a lot of professional experience across industries super quickly."
Job hopping to increase salary and skills early in a career -- historically, a red flag for employers -- is not new. However, it appears to be increasingly common: 22.3 percent of workers ages 20 and older spent a year or less at their jobs in 2022, the highest percentage with a tenure that short since 2006, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, an independent nonprofit. About 33 percent spent two years or less at their jobs.
But many Gen Z workers, and younger Millennials, aren't worried. Seventy-four percent of 18- to 26-year-olds and 62 percent of 27- to 42-year-olds were searching for a new job or planned to search in the next six months, according to a survey of U.S. employees conducted in May by Robert Half, a human resources consultancy.
Dawn Fay, operational president for talent solutions and business consulting at Robert Half, said in an email that the survey also asked hiring managers their top concerns when evaluating a candidate's résumé: 77 percent named job hopping.
Jeff Hyman, chief executive of Recruit Rockstars, a recruitment firm in Chicago, described job hopping as a "huge headache" for employers. When promising employees leave prematurely, others may wonder why, or follow suit, he said. "Human resources executives keep hoping it will improve, but it just seems to get worse by the month."
After just eight months at her corporate job in Pittsburgh, Erin Confortini, 24, was being recruited for similar jobs paying $ 20,000 a year more, but declined to pursue them, feeling the salary wasn't worth the risks of changing course. Ms. Confortini, who now earns additional income as a personal finance influencer on TikTok with over 246,000 followers, posted about her decision not to job hop. (As it turned out, she left the corporate job a year later to work at a start-up.) The post received more than 450 comments, with most advising her to follow the money rather than be loyal to a company ("fear should not drive decisions," read one).
While she understands this position, Ms. Confortini said, "I also think you need to consider what that will look like on your résumé."
Many recruiters agree.
Mr. Hyman, the recruiter, said although job hopping carries less of a stigma in the start-up community, traditional employers still see those candidates as risky. "Employers start to question the candidate's decision-making ability and judgment," he said. Hiring managers also complain that it's difficult to assess a person's performance in a job that lasted less than two years, he added.
To some extent, the trend may be a response to what younger employees perceive as corporations' unyielding focus on the bottom line. One reason for the prevalence of job hopping is the ongoing erosion of the employer-employee social contract, said Jessica Kriegel, a chief scientist at Culture Partners, a business consultancy focused on workplace culture. This is partly because of repeated, recession-related layoffs that now include pre-emptive layoffs in anticipation of a downturn, she said.
"Employees are looking at that and feel they have already lost what they thought they were getting, which was job security," Ms. Kriegel said.
This, in turn, has led many Gen Z workers to eschew company loyalty in favor of career development -- and, potentially, risk-taking. When Jonathan Javier, 28, started his first job as an operations specialist at Snapchat, the pay was low. But he had set his sights on the tech industry and felt grateful to be there. Eight months later, however, his role was outsourced to a contractor. Through LinkedIn, Mr. Javier connected with a recruiter at Google and was hired as an operations analyst; after a year, he made the move to sales trainer.
Soon after, Mr. Javier was tapped by another recruiter, offering a spot as an operations analyst at Cisco. "It was a higher-level job that pushed my salary to over six figures," he recalled. He took it, leaving Google after 18 months. During his tenure at Google, Mr. Javier had started a side hustle, Wonsulting, a career coaching business targeting young job seekers from marginalized backgrounds. When he was laid off a year after joining Cisco because of pandemic staffing cuts, Mr. Javier opted for entrepreneurship instead of another job search, and dived into Wonsulting full time.
That's three companies (and four roles) in just over three years, ending with a job of his own making.
Working for a corporation, Mr. Javier said, always made him feel "like a number," someone who could be dismissed at any time. Now, as his own boss, that anxiety is gone. And although the failure rate for start-ups is high, Mr. Javier said he isn't concerned.
"There's always a way back into corporate America if I want that."

Full text: Pharrell Williams -- the clothing designer who succeeded Virgil Abloh in February 2023, just over a year after his death, as Louis Vuitton's men's creative director; the Grammy-winning record producer behind such pop masterpieces as Justin Timberlake's "Justified" (2002) and Clipse's "Hell Hath No Fury" (2006); the musician and performer who in conversation casually refers to the French electronic duo Daft Punk as "the robots" and Karl Lagerfeld as "Karl" -- doesn't like talking about himself. "This is absolutely Dante's 'Inferno,"' he said over the phone this past June, a few days after lighting up Paris's Pont Neuf with his spectacular debut for the French fashion house. At one point, it seemed like he might give up on the conversation altogether. "This is straight up like voice mail syndrome," he said. "I mean, do you like listening to yourself on voice mail?"
Williams, 50, was raised in Virginia Beach by his father, Pharaoh, a handyman, and his mother, Carolyn, a teacher. It was there that he met numerous lifelong collaborators, including Chad Hugo, his producing partner in the Neptunes, a duo as important to the sound of hip-hop over the past 30 years as the Funk Brothers were to Motown in the 1960s. A dedicated polymath who shifts between styles, genres and media, Williams is his best, most creative self in the presence of water. He grew up in a housing project called Atlantis, right by the beach; today, he holds an annual music and art festival in Virginia Beach called Something in the Water. And when he's not in Miami on Biscayne Bay, he spends his time in Paris, where he has a music studio at the LVMH headquarters overlooking the Seine.
At top: "This was taken in Los Angeles last year, a few months before the Louis Vuitton announcement. Being a producer and a creative director are similar. I can go from apparel to drums, from trunks to melodies. Within my design studio, I have a section allocated to music, so I go back and forth all day."
Left and right: "I wanted to work with [the American artist] Henry Taylor [whose paintings, one of which is shown here, were embroidered onto garments and bags from Williams's first collection for Louis Vuitton]. It's not lost on me that this appointment was given to another Black man from America. This is pivotal for us, you know, after Virgil, our brother who's gone back up to the stars. I think it's important that we continue to tell interesting stories. I don't have an agenda -- I am the agenda. I want not only people who look like me but people who don't look like me to be inspired by this moment. And working with an artist like Henry Taylor helps tell that story."
Left: "This was taken at a Chanel show in Africa last year. [Williams was a brand ambassador from 2014 to 2022.] We went to Dakar, Senegal, and I had on a fresh pair of [Adidas] Sambas. Years ago, I'd asked Karl [Lagerfeld, Chanel's longtime creative director who died in 2019] to take the house to Africa, and he said we would get to it, but he passed before we got a chance to."
Center: "My oldest son [Rocket, pictured here with Williams at Disney World in 2012] makes beats. We [Pharrell and his wife, the model and fashion designer Helen Williams] also have triplets. It's a triple handful. We say it's beautifully intense and intensely beautiful."
Right: "We turned a house in Miami into a studio. I have no idea [when we set it up], but it's been a couple of years. I'm terrible with chronology: I live in the moment, but I process things in the future and I get lost in the past. In Miami, it's all about the weather and the humidity. It's always been very inspiring to me. It's fun to record there on the water, which sounds like a flex, but it's really not."
Left: "With this Vuitton appointment, it's like I'm a perpetual student. If I'm the king of anything, it's the king of being a pupil. I knew I wanted to work on Damier [the brand's signature checkerboard pattern]. I've always loved pixelated camo, so we did it with Damier, leveling it up, and that's how we got Damouflage [pictured here on a model during a fitting earlier this year]. Being surrounded by so many talented people is the best. I mean, I'm an Aries, so I've always been superimpulsive. But without the resources and the people, I'd be just like every other person with a great idea."
Center: "As a kid, I listened to a lot of records my aunt would play in her house. Parliament-Funkadelic had songs that blew my mind. I also think [Kraftwerk's sixth studio album] 'Trans-Europe Express' (1977) happened around that time. Atlantis was like this neighborhood in a bubble. It's where music was everything and, when certain songs came on, it was like a musical happening right there in front of you. You could either be a part of it or you could stand back and watch."
Right: "This picture was taken earlier this year at Le Café V [a Louis Vuitton cafe in Osaka]. Japan is my favorite place. On my 50th orbit, I had a birthday party organized by [the Tokyo-based artistic director of Kenzo and hip-hop producer] Nigo. One of the most amazing gifts is his presence in my life. Twenty years ago, I needed to go to Japan to record something, so Nigo arranged for me to come to his studio, which is basically a compound on five floors of a building. One floor is a showroom, one is a photo studio, another is a recording studio, and I was like, 'Wow, this guy lives what's in his head.' That changed me. I was so used to bragging because that was the world I came from. And then I met Nigo, who barely said anything. He didn't have to. Humility is in the Tokyo air like the humidity in Virginia."
Left: "I think this picture is from around 1976, so when I was 3 years old. I'm the third of eight kids -- two sisters and five brothers. I want to say 'Star Wars' (1977) came out around then. I just remember being back in the Atlantis apartments in Virginia Beach. I didn't know life was as hard as it was, because it was fun to me."
Center: "My favorite cartoon as a kid was 'Jabberjaw' (1976), and the band he played in was called the Neptunes. So that's where the name [of his songwriting and production duo with Chad Hugo] came from."
Right: "I love watching movies to escape. But the funny thing is, I couldn't tell you from what. My favorite movie is 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (1977). I relate to Richard Dreyfuss's character and the alien."

If there is anywhere in the country primed to welcome the clean energy transition, it is Penobscot Bay in Maine. Electricity prices there are high and volatile. The ocean waters are warming fast, threatening the lobster fishery. Miles offshore, winds blow strong enough to heat every home and power every car in the state.
For more than 15 years, researchers at the University of Maine have been honing scale models of floating wind turbines inspired by oil rigs. They are now confident they can mass-produce turbine blades the length of football fields and float them miles into the ocean. It is the kind of breakthrough in clean energy technology that is allowing a much faster transition to renewables than many believed possible, aided by state officials eager to pioneer a floating wind industry.
One key to harnessing that wind lies at the end of a causeway jutting into the bay, on a mostly undeveloped island where eagles fish offshore and people walk in the quiet shade. Many officials see this spot, known as Sears Island, as the ideal site to build and launch a flotilla of turbines that could significantly lessen Maine’s reliance on fossil fuels.
Standing in their way are environmental groups and local residents, all of whom are committed to a clean energy future and worried about the rapid warming of the Earth. Still, they want the state to pick a different site for its so-called wind port, citing the tranquility of Sears Island and its popularity and accessibility as a recreation destination.
On a recent summer morning one conservationist against the plan, Scott Dickerson, sat on a picnic bench and predicted environmental groups would sue to thwart development of the island, as they had many times in the past.
“And that, as you can imagine, is going to run the clock,” he said, costing the state valuable time that could be saved by looking elsewhere.
After years of fits and starts, the transition to renewable energy like wind and solar power is finally shifting into full gear in many parts of the world, including the United States, which has been buoyed by massive new subsidies from the Biden administration. But around the country, the effort is being slowed by a host of logistical, political and economic challenges.
Breaks in supply chains have stalled big projects. Historically low unemployment makes it hard to hire workers to build or install new turbines or solar panels. Shortcomings in the power grid can block newly generated electricity from reaching customers. Federal, state and local regulations, including often byzantine permitting requirements, threaten to delay some construction for years. So do the court battles that almost inevitably follow those permitting decisions.
These problems are not unique to the United States. In Europe, orders for new turbines dropped unexpectedly last year as developers struggled with inflation and sluggish permitting. In parts of China, a growing fraction of electricity from turbines and solar panels is being wasted because the grid lacks capacity. In Australia, clean energy companies have complained about a shortage of skilled workers.
At the same time, it tends to take longer to build solar arrays, wind farms, car chargers and transmission lines in the United States than in China, India and Europe, a recent analysis by the International Energy Agency found.
But no hurdle to a clean energy transition at the speed and scale scientists say is needed to avert catastrophic warming is easier to see than the growing local backlash to large-scale wind and solar projects, like the one roiling Sears Island.
The problem boils down to this: If lawmakers want to ramp up renewables as fast and cheaply as possible, they’ll need to bulldoze or build over some places that people treasure.
While Americans broadly support renewable energy, polls show, they are less enthusiastic about having it in their backyard. One survey from 2021 found that only 24% of Americans were willing to live within 1 mile of a solar farm; the number dropped to 17% for wind farms.
Such resistance is often rooted in anxieties about broader social and economic change in communities where families have lived for generations. But in some cases, like lawsuits trying to stop wind farm development off Massachusetts, groups with funding from fossil fuel interests have stoked fear. Those efforts are their own sort of obstacle to renewables: an attempt by incumbent energy players to protect their market share, even if the economics have turned against them.
A recent analysis found that it would cost less for electric utilities to build new wind and solar farms than to operate most of the existing coal-fired power plants — a stunning shift from 15 years ago, when burning coal was the cheapest way to make electricity.
But after years of rapid growth, installations of wind, solar and batteries slowed by 15% last year, according to the American Clean Power Association, a trade group.
“There’s a lot of capital ready to flow,” said Gregory Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, another trade group. “But to get these projects going, you need to get them permitted, you need to get them connected to the grid, you need workers, you need access to supply chains. All of that can still be quite difficult.”
In Maine, many of those challenges are concentrated at one choke point: where to put a new wind port, which state officials have not decided on.
Offshore turbines need a large slab of land where they can be built and launched to sea. That site must connect to highways, to truck in materials, but also sit beside deep water.
The state’s two main contenders are in Searsport, about 30 miles south of Bangor.
One site is an industrial area, Mack Point, clearly visible from Sears Island. It is the spot many locals and conservationists prefer. The company that owns it says it could be easily converted to build and ship offshore turbines.
But some officials have warned that it could be difficult for Mack Point to secure needed permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies in order to dredge the bay and build new port facilities.
In Searsport, many residents fear that state officials will bypass Mack Point, which sits on private land and would need to be leased for millions of dollars a year — costs that would probably be passed on to utility customers.
Sears Island, in contrast, is owned by the state. Under a previous agreement with conservation groups, two-thirds of its woods and beaches are to be a nature preserve. The other third is zoned for a port.
Supporters of choosing the island site include Habib Dagher, a godfather of Maine’s offshore wind efforts and the founding executive director of the University of Maine’s Advanced Structures and Composites Center. He suggested it was worth trading the existing open space of the island for lower energy prices and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
“All of us would like to think that we can have renewable energy with zero impact on the environment — as you know, it’s not possible, right?” Dagher said in an interview at his wind lab. “So our goal, and our challenge, is: How do we minimize impact on environment as we embark on this transformational energy system?”
Conservation groups have fought development on Sears Island for decades, beating back a nuclear power plant, a gas import terminal and more. They reject the idea that they must lose that fight now — even as they lament climate change.
Rolf Olsen is a retired marketing executive and an avid day hiker. He kayaks and likes to swim in Penobscot Bay after mowing his lawn. He drives a white plug-in Toyota Prius and is vice president of a group called Friends of Sears Island, and he sat on a state advisory panel over where to locate the wind port, which he says should be at Mack Point.
On a recent hike, he described what a Sears Island port might look like, in place of the oaks and the birches.
“I have a picture in my mind’s eye. You know, it’s huge, flat, towering concrete and steel,” he said. “It saddens me.”
So, he added, does the warming of the planet.
“I have a granddaughter who’s 3. She’s going to have to live in a different world.”

Full text: During a summer of hellish wildfires, searing heat, boiling oceans and torrential storms, it's easy to lose sight of the real progress being made in the fight against climate change.
Wind and solar are rapidly displacing coal, oil and gas. Sales of electric vehicles and heat pumps are soaring. And a gusher of government subsidies and private capital is fueling record investment in clean energy.
Over the weekend, The Times published a big article I helped write and report that reveals just how fast the energy transition is moving. I encourage you to read the whole thing.
The article was the first in a three-part series looking at the startling advances already underway, the obstacles that remain, and the battle to win hearts and minds.
To report these sweeping stories, we fanned out across the country, reporting from Kansas, Maine, Wyoming, California and beyond. But for me, the heart of the story was in Tulsa, Okla.
Once known as the "Oil Capital of the World," Tulsa still embraces its history as an energy boomtown. The minor league baseball team is called the Drillers, and an enormous gold-colored statue of an oilman leaning on a derrick looms over the state fair grounds. While there's still plenty of money being made from oil and gas in Tulsa, the city is also on the vanguard of the nationwide embrace of clean energy -- one that is happening faster than most people realize.
Over a few hot days in June, I visited job sites where solar installers were affixing photovoltaic panels to residential roofs and chatted with homeowners who had installed heat pumps and were driving electric vehicles.
I went to a factory that is churning out electric school buses thanks to generous subsidies from the federal government and visited the Port of Tulsa, which is preparing to welcome a $ 1 billion solar panel factory.
I rode an electric passenger bus operated by the city and zipped around downtown on electric scooters. I plugged in an electric Ford F-150 Lightning at a charging station operated by a local company. And before I left, I stopped by the University of Tulsa's School of Petroleum Engineering and met with professors working on carbon capture technology.
It was a revealing trip that showed me just how quickly the United States is pivoting away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy -- even in the historic heart of oil country. And it's particularly apt on the first anniversary of the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is proving to be much more popular, and expensive, than expected.
I hope you'll take some time to read the full article. Tomorrow, I'll tell you about the work of my colleagues who were looking into two big questions: what are the obstacles preventing broader adoption of clean energy, and how to persuade people to make the leap.

She's Antiwar, but Her Advice To Russians Is to Just Accept It: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ksenia Sobchak, one of the best known media figures still in Russia, says her fatalistic stance just reflects a grim reality. Some liberals call her a Kremlin stooge, while hawks see her as disloyal.
Emerging from a friend's Maserati on southern Spain's Mediterranean coast, Ksenia Sobchak wants the world to know: Back home in Russia, fighting for change is futile.
"There is no resistance, nor can there be any," she says. "This has to be understood."
She can point to ample proof to support her pessimism: Thousands of Russians have been arrested for protesting the war. Hundreds of journalists are in exile. Opposition leaders are serving yearslong prison terms.
All this sacrifice has failed to stop President Vladimir V. Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and, in Ms. Sobchak's view, these fruitless efforts only add weight to her message: Liberal Russians should find ways to live with Mr. Putin's war because there's nothing they can do about it.
Ms. Sobchak is one of the best-known media figures still based in Russia and the daughter of one of Mr. Putin's first political mentors. She is able to widely communicate her call for Russians to just cope with the war, though her stance has also made her profoundly unpopular among two distinctly different sets.
A former reality-TV host who remade herself as a liberal politician and journalist, Ms. Sobchak, 41, is reviled by many opposition activists who see her as a Kremlin stooge -- and by pro-war hawks who consider her disloyal.
But she is also a totemic figure of the Putin era: a celebrity influencer and media entrepreneur whose rise has tracked the acceptance of Mr. Putin's rollback of democracy -- and, now, his war -- by swaths of the Western-oriented, urban elite.
Her story helps illuminate some of the central debates taking place about wartime Russia. Given Mr. Putin's apparatus of repression, is it appropriate to expect Russians to look for ways to resist? Can the millions of antiwar Russians unable or unwilling to emigrate be condemned for trying to adapt to Mr. Putin's system and seeking a sense of normalcy?
Back in 2018, Ms. Sobchak ran for president, warning it would be a "tragedy" if Mr. Putin were re-elected but also urging people not to "demonize" him. Now, she says that she opposes the invasion of Ukraine; but on her hugely popular social media accounts, the invasion is akin to a natural disaster -- something to be endured, rather than a political choice that can be challenged.
"Putin made a pretty certain, clear decision," Ms. Sobchak said in a recent interview while on vacation at a Spanish seaside resort. "At some point you've got to accept that you can't influence it."
To her critics, however, Ms. Sobchak's profession of powerlessness rings hollow.
Mr. Putin has known her since he was a 1990s bureaucrat working for her late father, Anatoly A. Sobchak, then the mayor of St. Petersburg and the pro-democracy politician who launched Mr. Putin's political career. Her mother is a member of Russia's Parliament; her husband is a state theater director with a column in one of the government's main online propaganda outlets.
But Ms. Sobchak says she has not seen Mr. Putin since the war began and has not tried to speak to him about the invasion. Instead, Ms. Sobchak has learned to abide the war and says she is trying to help her compatriots do the same.
On her Instagram account, with 9.5 million followers, Ms. Sobchak parades down a Moscow sidewalk showing off her combination of a vintage Chanel bag with a Russian designer dress. On her YouTube channel, where she posts celebrity interviews, a reality TV star confesses that "I lost my libido" because of the invasion. On the social messaging app Telegram, Ms. Sobchak and her team solicit help for residents of Russian border regions displaced by Ukrainian shelling.
"I believe that this is a horrific situation," she says. "But we're going to get through this time, we'll get through it together with our audience."
She says her main source of income is hosting events like birthday parties and weddings. She also sells sponsorships on her YouTube channel.
To her defenders, Ms. Sobchak is doing a service despite her compromising stance by offering alternatives to state television on platforms that are still accessible online in Russia.
Her YouTube channel also features interviews with critics of the war. Her team of journalists publishes frequent news updates to Telegram with stories that Russia's state media tend to ignore: arrests of antiwar activists, violence committed by soldiers returning from the front and human rights abuses in the southern region of Chechnya.
The war has also amplified Ms. Sobchak's status as a leading foil to Aleksei A. Navalny, the opposition leader in prison since 2021.
In 2018, Mr. Navalny was barred from the ballot in Russia's presidential election, but the Kremlin allowed Ms. Sobchak to run, giving a sheen of pluralism to the vote that delivered a fourth term for Mr. Putin.
Mr. Navalny's backers argue that Ms. Sobchak should be under Western sanctions, and see her as a Kremlin propaganda tool targeting liberal Russians turned off by the pro-war bluster on state television. Maria Pevchikh, the exiled chairwoman of Mr. Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, said Ms. Sobchak is "planting in people a feeling of their own helplessness."
"This is a very bad, very scary message," Ms. Pevchikh said in a phone interview. "It really resonates with her audience because people take some solace in this: 'There's nothing to be done."'
Ms. Sobchak denies working for the Kremlin and sees the calls from abroad for Russians to resist as misguided and immoral. The failed mutiny in June by the warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, she says, underscores that whatever comes after Mr. Putin could be even worse.
"Where did the idea come from that after Putin, the 'beautiful Russia of the future' will arrive?" she asked, using a phrase popularized by Mr. Navalny.
Ms. Sobchak became famous as a reality-TV host in the early 2000s, then joined the Moscow street protests over election fraud in 2011. After the 2018 election, in which she came in fourth, she embraced a career as a lifestyle influencer and a journalist.
She says she last saw Mr. Putin at his annual news conference in December 2021, when American officials were already warning of an invasion. Rather than ask about the possibility of war, Ms. Sobchak questioned him about prison torture. Trying to spot her in the crowd, Mr. Putin referred to Ms. Sobchak with the informal Russian "you," signaling he knew her well.
Like many Russians, Ms. Sobchak dismissed the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine. She wrote on Feb. 16, 2022, that "Putin looked like a mature, decent politician" amid the "hysteria in American newspapers." When Russia did attack on Feb. 24, she posted a black square on Instagram and wrote: "We are all locked in this situation now. There is no way out."
In the weeks that followed, the Kremlin forced the shutdown of most of what remained of Russian independent media, and hundreds of journalists fled Russia, fearing arrest under a new wartime censorship law. Ms. Sobchak said she cried and woke up in panic during the night.
But she did not emigrate. Doing so would have meant becoming a stranger in a foreign land "who must constantly castigate, blame and apologize for their own country."
Instead, she declared she would do what she could to continue offering content from inside Russia, even if it meant eliding sensitive topics. Asked in the interview in Spain about her feelings toward Mr. Putin, she said: "Working in Russia, I prefer not to speak about my attitude toward people who have full power in my country."
On her YouTube channel in February, Ms. Sobchak told viewers: "We decided to stay here, but also to follow the laws." She added: "There are some things that I can't say directly, and some that, unfortunately, I can't say at all."
She has also increasingly turned against Western governments and Russians in exile. Both groups, she says, dismiss the plight of antiwar Russians who have stayed behind. She also accuses Western leaders of using the war to their geopolitical advantage instead of brokering a compromise to stop the dying.
"The lives of people are simply instruments of bargaining for better positions," she said. "This is monstrous and terrible. It's the height of cynicism."
Last October, Ms. Sobchak briefly fled Russia as three employees of her media company were arrested on suspicion of extortion. For a moment, it seemed that even those personally close to Mr. Putin could be the targets of repression. But after two weeks, Ms. Sobchak returned and publicly apologized to the Putin ally whom her employees were accused of extorting. She says she made the apology "for the sake of the guys" and that she is still "fighting for their freedom."
From her Spanish vacation spot by the marina of Puerto Banús, popular with super-rich Russians, Ms. Sobchak acknowledged she was worried about being hit by Western sanctions -- but also that she could be persecuted back in Russia for her antiwar stance. She hopes to avoid both fates.
"People are born to live calm, happy lives," Ms. Sobchak said. "People are not all born heroes."

Rather than ask about the possibility of war, Sobchak questioned him about prison torture. Trying to spot her in the crowd, Putin referred to Sobchak with the informal Russian “you,” signaling he knew her well.
Like many Russians, Sobchak dismissed the possibility of Russia invading Ukraine. She wrote on Feb. 16, 2022, that “Putin looked like a mature, decent politician” amid the “hysteria in American newspapers.” When Russia did attack on Feb. 24, she posted a black square on Instagram and wrote, “We are all locked in this situation now. There is no way out.”
In the weeks that followed, the Kremlin forced the shutdown of most of what remained of Russian independent media, and hundreds of journalists fled Russia, fearing arrest under a new wartime censorship law. Sobchak said she cried and woke up in panic during the night.
But she did not emigrate. Doing so would have meant becoming a stranger in a foreign land “who must constantly castigate, blame and apologize for their own country.”
Instead, she declared she would do what she could to continue offering content from inside Russia, even if it meant eliding sensitive topics. Asked in the interview in Spain about her feelings toward Putin, she said, “Working in Russia, I prefer not to speak about my attitude toward people who have full power in my country.”
On her YouTube channel in February, Sobchak told viewers, “We decided to stay here, but also to follow the laws.” She added, “There are some things that I can’t say directly, and some that, unfortunately, I can’t say at all.”
She has also increasingly turned against Western governments and Russians in exile. Both groups, she said, dismiss the plight of anti-war Russians who have stayed behind. She also accuses Western leaders of using the war to their geopolitical advantage instead of brokering a compromise to stop the dying.
“The lives of people are simply instruments of bargaining for better positions,” she said. “This is monstrous and terrible. It’s the height of cynicism.”
Last October, Sobchak briefly fled Russia as three employees of her media company were arrested on suspicion of extortion. For a moment, it seemed that even those personally close to Putin could be the targets of repression. But after two weeks, Sobchak returned and publicly apologized to the Putin ally whom her employees were accused of extorting. She said she made the apology “for the sake of the guys” and that she is still “fighting for their freedom.”
From her Spanish vacation spot by the marina of Puerto Banús, popular with superrich Russians, Sobchak acknowledged she was worried about being hit by Western sanctions — but also that she could be persecuted back in Russia for her anti-war stance. She hopes to avoid both fates.
“People are born to live calm, happy lives,” Sobchak said. “People are not all born heroes.”

Full text: At recent Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra performances, visibly diverse crowds took in programming new to the ensemble.
For the past 10 months, the back side of David Geffen Hall has greeted passers-by with Nina Chanel Abney's installation "San Juan Heal." Its bold, color-blocked illustrations pay tribute to the largely Black and Puerto Rican neighborhood that was torn down to make way for Lincoln Center in the mid-20th century.
"San Juan Heal" was a way of acknowledging this performing-arts campus's original sin. When it was announced, Henry Timms, the center's president and chief executive, said, "We've been very intentional about thinking about different voices, different audiences, more people seeing themselves at Lincoln Center."
But as the months passed, I began to wonder: Are there more people of color on the building than inside it? If the installation is both a nod to the past and a hope for the future, then what is Lincoln Center doing to get there?
The Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, which has taken up residence at Geffen Hall for two and a half weeks as part of Lincoln Center's Summer for the City programming, has a lot of ideas on that front. With so few concerts, it has little time to capture audience interest, but it also has more room to be conceptually agile.
Near the end of July, the ensemble's concerts began with a premiere by the Iraqi American composer Amir ElSaffar, featuring his Two Rivers ensemble, and continued with programs -- led by Thomas Wilkins, Gemma New and Jonathon Heyward -- that featured contemporary works about identity and equity while otherwise sticking to the orchestra's unofficial remit of familiar, easy-on-the-ears repertoire. The performances ranged from workaday to exhilarating.
Wilkins, in opening remarks, spoke of composers who feel "comfortable in their skin" as a kind of artistic self-actualization, and he and Heyward gave a platform to Black composers: Adolphus Hailstork, Xavier Foley, Jessie Montgomery and Fela Sowande.
At Wilkins's concert, Foley's "For Justice and Peace" -- written for double bass (Foley), violin (the concertmaster Ruggero Allifranchini) and string ensemble -- spurred into action with flashy passagework after an elegiac opening. In Sowande's African Suite (1944), the musicians tossed genial Nigerian melodies to one another with infectious spirit. But it was in the finale, Hailstork's Symphony No. 1, that Wilkins inspired excellence in them and conjured a heady mix of timbres like thrashing beams of light and glistening surges of sound.
Heyward opened his program with Montgomery's "Records of a Vanishing City," a tone poem that swirled with the music -- most conspicuously, Miles Davis -- that she heard growing up on the Lower East Side. Amid the piece's slippery, chimerical atmosphere, a solo clarinet, played by Jon Manasse, emerged with sweetly mellow innocence, like a child's voice in an urban variation of Barber's "Knoxville: Summer of 1915." As it happened, a vivacious account of Barber's Violin Concerto followed.
Last year's Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra concerts featured a diverse lineup of composers too, but the choices -- William Grant Still, Joseph Boulogne and Florence Price -- have sometimes crowded out contemporary composers. The recent programs, though, reflect an evolution in a more substantive direction toward true inclusivity.
Heyward, in his first concert with the orchestra since being named its next music director, displayed a natural rapport with the audience, an appealing podium manner and a crisp way with downbeats. Stiff at first in the Montgomery, he gradually relaxed into more organic gestures in the Barber and Schumann's "Rhenish" Symphony.
At the moment, though, there is a gulf between Heyward's intentions and his output. He spoke of "absolute joy" before the Schumann, then delivered something more like breathy contentment. Earthiness teetered on earthbound in the symphony's exultant depictions of the Rhineland.
Despite this orchestra's name, Mozart made just one appearance in the three recent programs, when New conducted his "Prague" Symphony, a sterling example of his mature style, woven together with unmistakable snatches of the operatic masterpieces he wrote around the same time, "Le Nozze di Figaro" and "Don Giovanni."
New cultivated a fine core of color and volume and shifted from it in gradations, though she didn't necessarily mine the Andante's introspection or the Presto's drama. She also led Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 1 and Sarah Gibson's "warp & weft," a mysterious, openhearted, at times astringent tribute to the feminist art movement of the 1970s that fought to elevate so-called women's work from craft to fine art.
The soloists on these three evenings brought personal flair, if not the last word in technique, to their showpieces. Foley's adroit, sly, softly powerful style in Bottesini's Double Bass Concerto No. 2 drew listeners to the edge of their seats despite a stylistically questionable habit of bending notes. Stewart Goodyear took off like gangbusters in the Mendelssohn piano concerto -- fast, efficient, driving -- and put aside elegance for hair-raising thrills. In Barber's rapturous Violin Concerto, Simone Lamsma smoothed over the tension brought by triplet rhythms in the first movement's long, sumptuous melody; her tendency to play on the sharp edge of the pitch gave her tone an uncanny brilliance that kept it from nestling into the warm orchestral textures.
Shanta Thake, Lincoln Center's artistic leader, came onstage before each concert to welcome the audience and lead it in what she called a "ritual." Last year, this call-and-response exchange felt like a way to speak healing into existence after the pandemic. This year, the audience's disengagement from the exercise deepened with each concert.
Arguably, Wilkins and Heyward are the ones creating community by enlarging the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra's repertoire. And if the delighted reactions of the large, diverse crowds -- who supplied enthusiastic applause and even scattered standing ovations between pieces -- are any indication, it's working.

Full text: I've made a special contribution to hip-hop, and I feel like that gets overlooked a lot of times. Hip-hop is Black culture. People say, "Oh, you make house music, a.k.a white people music." I'm like, honey, no. House music is Black music. Everything I do is in the spirit of hip-hop.
My first memory of hip-hop was O.D.B. on Mariah Carey's "Fantasy" remix. I was like 2, going on 3. And Lil' Kim's verse on "All About the Benjamins." The audacity was just so fab. I remember the video with the fisheye lens, the see-through dress and the blonde wig. And she started off with: "What the bloodclaat?/Wanna bumble with the bee, huh?/Throw a hex on the whole family." I didn't know what a hex was until I was maybe 16, but I could spit that [expletive] word for word.
I was a theater kid, and Lil Wayne, for sure, was like a thespian. It was theatrical and the jokes were funny. "Cannon" is probably one of the best Lil Wayne verses ever. [Raps "Cannon" for 30 seconds]
But my favorite rapper of all time is Styles P, from hearing the Lox at block parties. Then we had the DatPiff era, so I would download like, "Ghost in the Machine." I just like how unrehearsed he is. And the swag. He was talking to you rather than trying to create a fantastical world. We actually have a song together on my first mixtape. He did it for free. I've done collabs with other male rappers that will probably never see the light of day because I wouldn't sign their record deal. Like, damn, Yeezy -- I loved you my entire life and that's what you do?
I started rapping because I had this boyfriend who rapped and they would do these cyphers. If your bars were wack, they would, like, snatch the blunt from you, you know? I skipped the cypher for like two weeks and came back with a vengeance. I had to learn all these words for "firearm." I wrote "Seventeen" over that Ladytron beat and when they passed me the blunt that day, I came out with: "I'm not the don diva/I'm beyond ya don skeezers/I get cake from quick chicks with long heaters." They was like, "Ohhh. Shorty, you can rap! You should record that!"
The very first record that I ever recorded was into a microphone in a sock in this guy's closet in between all these Supreme jackets. Two weeks later, I was featured on the Fader blog.
I blew up overnight and then it was just kind of like, OK, I have a job to do now. I think that all of that theatrical training definitely helped. When it came to "212," that white girl Valley Girl voice, I was really just making fun of dumb bitches who come to New York for like two years and are like, I'm a New Yorker!
I think that everyone at XL Recordings forgot that I was 17. There was no mentorship. Everybody kind of abandoned me and expected me to know what they wanted. At the same time, they had just signed Odd Future, who were super duper crass. I won't lie -- I was so jealous just watching them put all this love into Odd Future. Just to see them be given the support to be kids. It's a classic tale of boys can do whatever they want, but girls need to be like, prim and proper. I sent "212" in to XL and they dropped me. It was 100 percent a bunch of misogynoir.
I was thinking maybe I should go get a G.E.D. and go to college. Then I get this phone call from Nick Grimshaw on BBC Radio 1, and he's played it like a million times. I didn't even know what BBC Radio 1 was. And then very quickly you go from getting paid $ 150 and a bottle of Smirnoff to perform to getting like €5,000 at some weird charity event. I'd never had 5,000 anything all at once, ever. All I could think was, I'm going to get a weave and a laptop.
One thing leads to another, and then I'm at Karl Lagerfeld's house. I didn't even know who Karl Lagerfeld was when he invited me to perform at his house in Paris. I didn't know what Coachella was when I got booked for Coachella. That Coachella date in 2012, it was like, all right, I'm here. I'm a star.
Jimmy Iovine, the very first day I met him, he said to me, "The best thing you can do for a woman is get the [expletive] out of her way." He actually bought me my first, like, three pairs of Louboutins, my first Chanel bag, my first real bottle of perfume. He was always a gentleman and he always thought my jokes were funny.
"212" was such an anomaly that no one has been able to successfully build upon it outside of me. What I see is people doing an Azealia Banks impression, and that is partially due to just the belief that a woman couldn't be the mastermind behind the sound, the aesthetic, the everything. I'm still alive, girls.
There's no magic in hip-hop now. Hip-hop has been taken from us and used as a weapon against us. No one is talking about anything. Just for the record: All these little new rap girls -- they really suck.

I Chose to Put On Lipstick for All This?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Lunch with an older friend prompts a writer to try some seemingly outdated stratagems for attracting a mate.
I don't usually wear lipstick. Or heels. Or pants with zippers.
Post-pandemic, post-babies and post-divorce, I've grown selective about how I spend my energy and time, and cobbling together a costume of femininity takes a significant amount of both. But I wonder if this laissez-faire perspective (ahem: sweatpants in public) has kept me in relationship purgatory, where I'm never actively dating but still secretly hoping someone special will intuit the beauty beyond my sweats.
On a recent lunch date with a friend in her 80s, I listened with mounting dread as she lamented her own divorce, which happened 30 years ago. With tears in her eyes, she said there'd been no one serious in her life since her marriage ended, and she was resigned to dying alone.
All at once I was looking across the table at my future self. There I was, four decades later, mourning the second-act relationship that had never happened. There I was, ordering Diet Coke refills in a suburban Carrabba's, convinced my marriage had been my one shot at love and that I had wasted it on the wrong person. There I was, telling a friend half my age that sometimes, no matter how much you want it, love may never show up.
I left the restaurant shaken. My life was half over, and I was on the express train to Lonelyville: a singles room in the nursing home. Ravioli leftovers for one. The distant, dreamlike memory of what it felt like to be touched. I had to change course, but it wasn't as simple as just "getting back out there."
The end of my marriage hadn't been an anomaly -- I had never had a healthy, long-term relationship, and I couldn't understand why. Did I have unrealistic expectations? A fear of intimacy? A broken partner picker? All I knew for sure was that the common denominator in every failed relationship was me.
That night, while swiping past the Instagram posts of partnered family and friends, a sponsored video stopped me mid-scroll. A hunky New Zealander had a question for me. Yes, me. Did I know how to inspire emotional attachment in the man of my choice? (I did not.) He went on to say that creating emotional attachment was the only way to form a lasting relationship. While I had thought of love as something that happened to me, like a natural disaster, this guy was saying that lasting relationships were intentional bonds cultivated by people with a very particular set of skills, none of which I seemed to possess.
I signed up for a relationship boot camp. The first assignment was to read a 102-page PDF that revealed how to "capture his attention and win his heart" using proven principles of attraction. Perfect, I thought. I'll finally know what to say on a first date, how to sniff out psychopaths before I sleep with them, and how to shepherd that initial spark of attraction into something deeper.
But when I opened the PDF, I found it packed ... with lipstick.
Chanel Rouge Coco Bloom. MAC Ruby Woo. Wet 'n' Wild Shining Hibiscus.
"Principle #1: Have Luscious Lips!"
When a woman is aroused, her blood flow increases, making her lips appear redder and fuller -- AKA nature's lipstick! Studies show that men prefer women who wear lipstick over women who don't!
I stared at the words, my un-luscious lips agape, wondering if this "boot camp" was nothing more than a collection of Cosmopolitan-style beauty hacks written by ChatGPT.
"Principle #2: Have Wide Hips!"
Over millennia, men learned that coupling with wide-hipped women led to more successful procreative outcomes!
Fine, I thought. Wear makeup, rock a hot bod and swallow every media-inspired standard of beauty. But should I mention my kids on a first date?
"Principle #3: Stick Out Your Sexy Bum!"
It went on like this for 102 pages. I laugh-cried my way through the list, texting pictures of the "principles" to friends and mentally calculating my boot camp refund.
But in the days that followed, I became slightly obsessed with the principles, particularly their "scientific" explanations. Let me be clear: the principles were absurd. They were comically archaic and offensively exclusive to "feminine women seeking masculine men." But I was spellbound by the idea that attraction could be sparked by something as simple as smudging some color on my mouth.
What if our cultural standards of attractiveness really could be traced back along evolutionary lines to their original source, like a rumor that's mostly false but partly true? Maybe what had been missing in my quest to attract the right partner was biological. Maybe, without lipstick, I was invisible to men! It would be impossible to inspire emotional attachment in someone who hadn't even noticed me, right?
I started wearing lipstick on Zoom calls for work. Bright lipstick. Arousal lipstick. I strutted across the grocery store parking lot to create the illusion of wider hips. At my son's baseball practices, I stuck out my "sexy bum" just to see what it felt like. (It felt stupid.)
I did nothing else out of the ordinary -- no makeover, no personality transplant -- but men I'd known for years started responding to me differently. For the first time since our sons started playing together, the Baseball Dads seemed aware of my existence.
Cute Dad struck up conversations during practice. Tall Dad noticed me squinting in the bleachers and positioned himself to block the sun from my view. Canadian Dad gave me a high-five and traced his fingers across my palm before letting go.
As preposterous as I initially thought the principles were, they seemed to work. For a few weeks, I felt positively witchy every time some poor sucker let me skip him in line at the self-checkout, and I waited for the attention to manifest a date. Several months later, I'm still waiting.
These days I've been getting notifications to order more lipstick, because I'm supposed to be running low, but I haven't worn lipstick in weeks. It seemed to me that the attention I got when I followed the principles wasn't leading me to a future I really wanted. Instead, it pointed to an ancient past, prompting a biological reflex that, while initially flattering, felt like a cheap substitute for a real connection. Why put on lipstick just to be reminded that what's missing in those moments of attraction is what's most essential?
According to the boot camp syllabus, I'm supposed to be bantering with men on dating apps, using compliments that double as insults because "men want to play."
You know what I want? A handsome stranger who approaches me from across a crowded room. "I couldn't help but notice your lipstick," he might say, handing me a moist toilette to wipe it off. He'll look me up and down, frowning at the too-tight jeans I can barely zip up. "Let's get out of here," he'll say. "You look like you want to slip into something more comfortable."

Crafting with T; The Art of the Party Hat: [Style Desk]

Full text: Seven makers from across the creative fields propose fantastical celebratory headwear.
In the United States, party hats -- those ubiquitous, cone-shaped signifiers of children's birthdays and summer picnics -- have their roots in a less celebratory phenomenon: the pointed dunce caps used as disciplinary tools in schools throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. It's a reminder that even the most unassuming objects can have complex meanings -- something that artists, several of whom have turned to party attire for inspiration, have long known.
The students of the Bauhaus, the influential German design academy founded in 1919, took their costume parties as seriously as their studies, dressing up as monstrous creatures and mechanical humanoids. And in 1972, the Spanish painter Salvador Dalí designed several fantastical ensembles for the infamous Surrealist Ball, a lavish gathering held at the French estate of the baroness Marie-Hélène de Rothschild. Celebrities and politicians arrived wearing towering headpieces to dine atop body-shaped mannequins splayed across tables; the actress Audrey Hepburn peered out from a rattan bird cage, complete with stray feathers, that sat on her shoulders.
In the spirit of this tradition, T invited makers working across the creative fields -- the multidisciplinary designer Faye Toogood; the ceramic artist Jolie Ngo; the fashion designer Piotrek Panszczyk of the brand Area; the multimedia artist Rakeem Cunningham; the costume designer Alexia Hentsch; and the designer Adam Charlap Hyman and the architect Andre Herrero of the firm Charlap Hyman & Herrero -- to propose their versions of a party hat. The only criterion was that each hat be made of materials typically available at a craft store so that, by following the artists' instructions, shared in the PDF below, the hat could be recreated at home. From there, imaginations ran free, yielding headdresses that resemble, among other things, a rainbow-colored palm tree, a coral reef and an otherworldly drinking helmet.
Alexia Hentsch
In January, while attending a wedding in Recife, a coastal city in northeast Brazil, the costume designer Alexia Hentsch came upon a group of dancers rehearsing for a carnival procession. Having closed her understated men's wear line Hentsch Man in 2015 to pursue more maximalist endeavors, such as designing the costumes for the opening ceremony of the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hentsch was struck by the elaborate outfits worn by the performers. There were hand-embroidered ponchos and egg-shaped headpieces dripping with shimmering tinsel. For this project, Hentsch fashioned her take on the latter by gluing strips of stretched crepe paper onto an oversize straw sun hat, adding brightly colored layers until its surface resembled shaggy raffia palm leaves. "The materials were simple, but the work was like couture," says Hentsch, 41, of the ensembles she saw. "I'm fascinated by that high-low culture, and I think we have that all over Brazil, especially during Carnival."
Rakeem Cunningham
The artist Rakeem Cunningham's tender self-portraits, photographed within fabric-draped sets he builds in his Los Angeles studio, celebrate every aspect of himself, including his Blackness and his queerness. One other such trait he's learned to appreciate and reframe is the fact that he enjoys smoking weed, which is why Cunningham's party hat, a deconstructed baseball cap that he's covered with white polyester fiber fill, looks, in part, like a fluffy haze of smoke. "It just made me think of being on cloud nine, being elevated and just really enjoying life," says Cunningham, 31, who has a solo exhibition on view at Schlomer Haus Gallery in San Francisco. The hat, he says, "is definitely something meant to be worn by Black people." Central to his practice, he continues, "is the relationship between Black people and bodies and fantasy. I think it's important for us as Black people to be able to exist in our own fantasy worlds, costumes and stories and -- without guilt -- take up space in fantasy settings that weren't welcome to us." The addition of red and black Afro picks, tied in place with wire, is a nod to Cunningham's father, who died when the artist was 4 years old, and who gave him a similar comb, a memory that he still cherishes.
Adam Charlap Hyman and Andre Herrero
Grottos, popular in 18th-century Britain as decorative follies in gardens and parks, have found contemporary fans in Adam Charlap Hyman, 32, and Andre Herrero, 33, the designer-architect duo behind the New York- and Los Angeles-based design firm Charlap Hyman & Herrero. They have often recontextualized this motif with humor and whimsy, once creating a sculpture by adorning defunct telephones and keyboards found in the basement of the New York nonprofit space the Storefront for Art and Architecture with barnacles and starfish. Their "grotto hat," as Charlap Hyman calls it, is composed of a straw boater hat decorated with an array of preserved undersea life: shells, sponges, coral and pearls. "We love to work in the format of a homage," says Charlap Hyman, who referenced the 20th-century British Surrealist Eileen Agar's wearable sculpture "The Ceremonial Hat for Eating Bouillabaisse" (1936), a cork basket painted blue and topped with lobster tails and fish skeletons.
Faye Toogood
A towering headpiece in three stackable segments, Faye Toogood's party hat bridges two of the designer's latest projects, which she releases through her namesake fashion, design and interiors brand. It takes its cagelike shape from lobster traps, a nod to Toogood's maritime-inspired spring 2023 collection, which included voluminous sea-foam green trousers and striped watercolor prints. And its hues, particularly the dark red of its ribbon, tease Toogood's forthcoming clothing collection, which pulls its palette from the paintings of the American artist Philip Guston, whose work will feature in a major exhibition at London's Tate Modern in October. "I've just gone through a few months being really inspired by his attitude to his work," says Toogood, 46. "He had the courage to carve his own path and make his own way." As with many of Toogood's creations, the hat is at once sculptural and utilitarian, able to be collapsed and transported like a paper lantern.
Jolie Ngo
A longtime player of life-simulating video games like The Sims and Animal Crossing, the artist Jolie Ngo, 27, says she was conditioned to become "a world builder in a digital space" from a young age. She designs her vibrant pastel-gradient vessels and wonkily shaped sculptures on a computer using 3-D-modeling technology, which she views as another environment where "you're able to create and be free," then prints them with a machine loaded with colored clay or porcelain. Every year, in late January or early February, Ngo celebrates the Vietnamese holiday Tết by decorating paper crowns with her family in Philadelphia, which is why her party hat takes the form of a whimsical tiara. The primary material -- plastic straws, which Ngo bent into place after applying heat with a hair dryer -- is a more unexpected tribute to novelty drinking helmets. "Play is really evident in my practice," she says, "and I think those hats are kind of goofy. There's a really playful element to them."
Piotrek Panszczyk
Butterfly shapes have become a hallmark of the New York brand Area since its establishment in 2014 -- as audacious crystal-encrusted halter tops or cutout detailing on jeans and tees -- so much so that the label's designer, Piotrek Panszczyk, 37, dedicated the entirety of his latest collection to the insect. "It's a bittersweet motif [because] I hate butterflies," says Panszczyk. "Even when I was growing up, there was some type of beauty to them, but there was also something gross. Because of that, I like revisiting and reframing it in different ways." A graphic black-and-white butterfly, its exaggerated wings obscuring the model's eyes, was fixed to a felt wool cap and styled backward for the brand's pre-fall 2023 look book. Inspired by how fans have recreated items from Area's previous collections, the designer opted to reimagine this showpiece using an accessible material, card stock paper, with a simple band construction. "It's really about evoking something and including people in your world," Panszczyk says.

Full text: It's sale season for swimwear, a great time to upgrade your basic old go-to.
August might seem a little late to shop for swimsuits, but it's also the time of year when many of us may finally be on vacation -- and, hopefully, in or near a body of water.
If you've waited 'til now to replace your old swimsuit, fear not. There are lots of options still available and many are on sale! Of the various styles to choose from, few can get more mileage than a simple black one-piece, a classic that people should have in their arsenal.
One reason black one-pieces are considered a staple is because you can find them at countless retailers like the Gap. There's nothing wrong with one-piece swimsuits from these chains; they typically are inexpensive and fit pretty well. But rarely does buying them make you feel anything other than relieved that you don't have to shop for more.
For those who want something that's bolder, below are seven options that are better than a basic black one-piece -- including a polished halter-top style that might surprise people when they find out it is from the Gap.
J.Kim: Chilla Petal One-Piece
The designer Jenia Kim is known for using petal cutouts in pieces for her line J.Kim. The brand's first collection of swimwear includes a black one-piece that features the signature cutouts. And to those wondering: Yes, the cutouts' positioning takes unwanted "slips" into account, according to the brand.
Lido: Trentanove Rib
Lido is a brand sold at coastal Italian hotels and cult boutiques across the world, including La Garçonne, in TriBeCa, and Voo Store, in Berlin. Its timeless, minimal swimsuits are rendered in sophisticated solids as well as in dreamy gradients and can be worn beyond the beach or the pool. This Trentanove one-piece is designed to mimic the look of a rib-knit tank, meaning it can also be worn as a body suit.
Jean Paul Gaultier: Multicolor 'The Scarf' Swimsuit
If you love prints, look to brands that have been deftly using them for decades -- Pucci and Marimekko are great bets, as is Jean Paul Gaultier, which made this swimsuit for its spring 2023 collection. The one-piece's abstract imagery refers to textile collages from Gaultier's spring 2001 show. Another patterned Gaultier option is "The Body Morphing" one-piece, which features a warped striped print first used by the brand in its spring 1996 collection.
Baserange: Vein Swim Body
Baserange has developed a cult following for its unisex basics. This canary-yellow one-piece cleverly employs contrasting brown seams to add visual intrigue -- a technique that fans of the brand might recognize.
Eres: Black Tapis Rouge Swimsuit
Eres, which is owned by Chanel, dominates the luxury swim space. Its swimsuits can cost up to $ 800 and are made with peau douce, a soft, clingy proprietary fabric that incorporates polyamide and spandex. (The fabric, according to the brand, is a reason for the high prices.) With a bateau neckline and an open back, the elegant, trend-defying Tapis one-piece is a silhouette worth splurging on, especially when it goes on sale, as is often the case this time of year.
Nu Swim: Straight One-Piece
Nu Swim has won the attention of minimalism-adoring customers in part because its swimwear is produced at a family-owned factory in Queens that handled J. Crew's swimwear in the '90s -- a golden era to those in the know.
Gap: Recycled Halter One-Piece Swimsuit
If you've considered the previous options and thought, "Actually, I'd rather just have a Gap one-piece," try this classic silhouette with a full-coverage bottom, a flattering fit and crisscross straps that look more interesting than the average neckline.

Full text: Mendel Goldberg, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, opened his shop in the late 1800s. Four generations later, it's a go-to destination for top costume designers.
Step behind the unassuming facade of Mendel Goldberg Fabrics on Manhattan's Lower East Side and you'll suddenly find yourself surrounded by an array of gorgeous fabrics on its floor-to-ceiling shelves: bolts and neatly folded stacks of fine cottons, silks, satins, taffetas and lace as well as more opulent materials, from bubble-gum pink metallic brocade to apple green silk satin jacquard and shimmery pleated navy chiffon. There are fabrics woven with gold thread or glittering with Swarovski crystals. And there is Chanel-style wool bouclé in pale pink, or black and white woven with little ribbons and pearls. The material is as luxuriously textured as a lamb's coat. I want it.
I don't sew. I haven't got the DNA (no one in my family did). I've never really paid attention to the world of bespoke clothing or the fabrics a designer might use, not until a few months ago, when I went to Hester Street -- a street once jammed with pushcarts and now crowded with delivery bikes -- and walked into Mendel Goldberg, where, feeling as if I'd wandered into a psychedelic dreamscape, I coveted everything.
Presiding over the shop from her usual perch, above a large wooden table where she measures out the fabric, was proprietor Alice Goldberg, wearing a fitted white blouse, a narrow beige skirt with a zipper up the back and black flats. Goldberg is the fourth generation of her family to run the store since her great-grandfather Mendel founded it. Alongside Luis Ortega, the Goldbergs' aide-de-camp since 1989, Alice has witnessed a few memorable shopping sprees, including the time a few years back when a group of Saudi princesses spent about 30 minutes in the store, "buying like crazy," and the day seven bridesmaids purchased beaded sky blue tulle for their dresses.
Costume designers are also frequent customers. Among them is John Glaser, who oversaw the wardrobe for season one of Netflix's "Bridgerton" (along with Ellen Mirojnick) as well as that for the upcoming season three. "You can get things here you can't get anywhere else, like certain very rich and expensive over-embroidered or beaded material," Glaser says. He's used Mendel Goldberg's fabrics for a number of the costumes for the Regency-era period drama, including a sheer white frock in laser cut silk chiffon, a fabric that "we used inside out," Glaser adds. "There was also a dress for Lady Bridgerton made of pale blue silk jacquard that reminded me of an 18th-century wallpaper."
While I'm in the shop, I watch as Goldberg drapes ivory gazar against a bride-to-be, showing her how it would work as an engagement party dress. Later that afternoon, Tsigie White, the costume designer for the TV series "Power Book III: Raising Kanan," stops in. She's mesmerized by a piece of gold material covered with glittering paillettes. "I'll find something to do with it for the show," she says while Goldberg measures a yard of it for her. "I've never been here before; a friend mentioned it," she continues. "This is a great find for me."
Goldberg knows her stock by heart, and even the stores's website -- seemingly the business's largest concession to the 21st century -- is wonderfully detailed, the fabrics carefully described and shown draped on mannequins. Goldberg's customers are based all over the country, as well as abroad; some of them ask to browse the fabrics over Zoom or FaceTime. "I want everyone to buy on the internet with the same confidence as if they walked in the store. Let's say you're in Texas and you order something online. I don't want you to open [the package] and say, 'Oh my God,' " she says. "I want you to be thrilled."
It's a long way from the days when Mendel Goldberg, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, sold tailoring supplies off a pushcart on the Lower East Side. In 1890, he opened the shop in this five-floor building. (The basement is now the stockroom; apartments occupy the upper four stories.) His son Alexander sold silk to furriers for coat linings; Alexander's son Samuel -- Alice's father -- sold fabric to Gimbels and Macy's, both of which had large departments for home dressmaking.
The business prospered. Alice was born in Brooklyn and spent her later childhood years in Great Neck, N.Y., where her parents lived and commuted to Hester Street. "I was a very sheltered girl," she says. "All my clothes were made for me by my grandma Ida, Alexander's wife."
After college, Alice taught math, married and moved to Manhattan's Upper East Side, where she still lives. She has two daughters, Alexandra, who lives in Jerusalem, and Josefa, who lives in New Rochelle, N.Y. Josefa's daughter Eliana did her recent high-school senior thesis on fashion. If she eventually takes over Mendel Goldberg Fabrics, Eliana will be the sixth generation to manage the business.
Alice Goldberg didn't join the family business until she was in her 30s. Her father came to her home and said, "'Your mother is sick, you have to come into the store.' I walked in and never left," she says.
Her first assignment was a fabric buying trip to Europe. "At some of the great Swiss companies, I saw the most beautiful goods. They asked about my credit because they didn't know me," she says, smiling. "I say, 'Can you do me a favor? Please send someone to tell my driver I'll be here for some time.' I figured if they saw I had a Mercedes with a chauffeur it would be all right." She got the credit, and now travels to Italy, Switzerland and France twice a year.
It isn't just the sumptuous fabrics that make Mendel Goldberg so sought out by connoisseurs, however, but Alice Goldberg herself. "I've never had a return," she says. "Never. How crazy is that?" I'm thinking about a winter coat. As if she's read my mind, she shows me navy blue French wool bouclé and suggests we line it in printed cashmere. As my mother always said, "Why have economy in fantasy?"

Her Personal and Business Aspirations Merge: [Style Desk]

Full text: Sporty & Rich, a popular line of merch that promotes healthy, luxurious living, is opening its first store-spa-cafe. Next stop: colonic clubs?
There was once an Instagram account called Sporty & Rich. For a time, it served no commercial purpose. It was more of a brain tickle of pleasing images: a mood board of supermodels, interiors and advertisements, mostly from the 1980s and 1990s.
It posted vintage Range Rovers and Rolexes and Ralph Lauren -- an affluent flavor of nostalgia occasionally punctuated by more modern references, like Frank Ocean's album cover, Phoebe Philo's designs for Céline, and President Barack Obama playing basketball. When it came to sports, it favored both the sexy (an up-skirt photo of a woman playing tennis) and the ironic (Joe Namath at 70, cocooned in a fur coat at the Super Bowl).
The account, created by Emily Oberg when she was 20 years old, was a hobby. It was an expression of her personal style, which she described as "mixing high and low, like sneakers with a designer bag, in a way I think is very common and ubiquitous now." At the time, Ms. Oberg was living in an apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, and working as a video personality for the media company Complex.
But hobbies do not stay hobbies for long in the modern age. As her following grew, Ms. Oberg envisioned a print magazine. She envisioned a small line of merch: simple hoodies and tote bags and hats embroidered with "Sporty & Rich." Then she began to envision a different life for herself -- one of less hustle and more leisure. She moved to Los Angeles in 2018, and now her T-shirts are printed with phrases like "Health Is Wealth!" and "Drink More Water!"
The brand has also since grown, according to its chief executive, David Obadia, into an approximately $ 30 million business.
Now 29, Ms. Oberg has returned to New York to open Sporty & Rich's first retail location. The SoHo store will not only sell her vintage-inspired activewear and graphic loungewear, but also offer two spa services: a "lymphatic sculpting" massage and a "natural face-lift" facial that targets buccal fat. Instead of mannequins in the front window, there is a large sculpture of a glass of green juice, which will be served in the store's cafe along with bone broth, smoothies and coffee imported from Los Angeles.
Soon there will be Sporty & Rich skin-care products, and Ms. Oberg said she was working on developing dietary supplements and sex toys, too. If this all sounds a little familiar, that's intentional.
"I kind of want us to be a younger person's version of Goop," Ms. Oberg said while overseeing the unpacking of the new store last week. She had just flown in from Majorca. It was an oppressive 89 degrees in New York, and she wore a chambray shirt (Ralph Lauren) tucked into white jeans (Khaite) with stiletto-heel ankle boots (the Row) and a gold watch (Cartier).
"I don't think it really matters what we make," Ms. Oberg said. "I think people just want something that's Sporty & Rich."
The Gwyneth Playbook
In the years since she moved to Los Angeles, Ms. Oberg has been open about her personal health routines and experiments. Last year she published "The Sporty & Rich Wellness Book," a $ 100 coffee-table tome of advice and artful photos of toned-and-tanned models in states of undress.
In 2020, she told The Strategist she got "colonics a lot" and recommended her favorite at-home enema kit, which she said she used with coffee instead of water. In person, she talked about getting ozone therapy from a naturopath to help treat her autoimmune disorder, Graves' disease. "That's done through the rectum," she added.
Ms. Oberg knows that "people in wellness are heavily, heavily scrutinized," she said. She knows this from being "obsessed" with the Goop founder, Gwyneth Paltrow, a fellow fan of rectal ozone therapy who courts outrage on a biannual basis (most recently for discussing liquid diets). But Ms. Oberg also speaks from personal experience.
In 2020, she apologized for an Instagram post that compared the prices of fast food and snacks to "real food." (The price of a McDonald's Happy Meal, $ 3.57, was listed next to a bag of lettuce, $ 1.99.) She had written that people "don't need to be rich to be healthy" and should "stop making excuses" -- remarks that were criticized as insensitive and ignorant of the reality of food deserts. In her apology, Ms. Oberg explained that her post "was meant for people who DO have the option to choose a healthy lifestyle, not those who have no option or choice."
More remarks by Ms. Oberg resurfaced -- a since deleted Instagram account called @notsportyrich was devoted to aggregating them -- as when she identified as a "big time" anti-vaxxer on a giggly 2019 episode of "Failing Upwards" (a shock jock fashion podcast now known as "Throwing Fits," co-hosted by her former boss at Complex).
"I think that there were a lot of people who love to hate me, for whatever reason," Ms. Oberg said.
Asked about the vaccination backlash now, Ms. Oberg said she had treated the interview as a "silly" and "stupid" conversation with friends and didn't fully understand that her comments might upset people. She is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, she said, and "would never put other people in harm by not getting a vaccine." She attributed her beliefs in part to her upbringing.
"My mom was really into natural medicine and natural remedies and eating super-healthy and being active," said Ms. Oberg, who was raised in Calgary, Alberta, which has been compared to the Texas of Canada for its large oil industry and annual Stampede rodeo. "I was vaccinated when I was a baby, but slowly over time, she became more and more skeptical."
If Ms. Oberg's mother influenced her notions about health, her father, who immigrated to Canada from the Philippines, influenced her style and taste. He was an outdoorsman, skateboarder and sneaker collector who once dressed her in baby-size Air Jordans. He valued durability and longevity in products, having worked as a letter carrier, "pounding the pavement," he said, for the last 21 years.
Ms. Oberg described her childhood as comfortable, but not particularly Rich -- "that part of the brand was very much something that I always wanted and wish I had" -- or Sporty, other than being on the badminton team in high school.
"I was just obsessed with clothes and fashion," said Ms. Oberg, who began working in retail at 14 at Canada's elevated fast-fashion chain Aritzia, as well as the department store Holt Renfrew. She left Calgary at 18 for Vancouver, then moved to New York two years later to work with Complex's new video team in New York.
Complex is perhaps best known today for "Hot Ones," a series in which celebrities answer questions while sampling progressively spicier sauces. Ms. Oberg was best known for "Get Sweaty," a series in which celebrities answered questions while working out with her, and for interviewing hypebeasts waiting in line for hours outside Supreme.
Through Complex, she became a sort of micro-celebrity, particularly among young male streetwear fans, some of whom continue to comment on her Instagram photos. A bikini shot -- headless, as her selfies frequently are -- recently yielded the comment: "Like 10 years of getting thirst trapped and I'm still here." (Ms. Oberg said these kinds of comments don't bother her: "I don't like when girls who post all these sexual photos are like, 'How dare you objectify me.' It's like, 'What do you expect?"')
Yet Ms. Oberg has largely managed to transcend the "influencer" epithet. Her personal Instagram account may be conventionally aspirational -- frequent subjects include her European travels and concave stomach -- but it's not filled with sponsored posts. In the past, she has pointed out the absurdity of the influencer industry. She told the "Failing Upwards" podcast that she once was paid $ 12,000 to post for a makeup brand. She does not typically wear makeup.
"Emily was never into fame or fortune -- that's funny to say, because that's kind of where it's at right now," her father, Deo Abesamis, said. "I always try to tell her things like, 'This can be all gone tomorrow, so enjoy your time now.' And she realizes that."
She did recently experience one unfortunate rite of passage for the rich and famous: getting burgled. While on vacation with her boyfriend (a co-founder of the activewear brand Splits59), a number of items were taken from her new Beverly Hills home. The loot included four Hermès bags (two of them Birkins) and four Chanel jackets, all of which, she said, she had bought for herself.
She was surprisingly sanguine: "At first it was very sad, but it really is just things, and they can be replaced." Though not through her insurance, she said, which expired before the break-in.
Join the Club
Before devoting herself full time to Sporty & Rich, Ms. Oberg spent most of 2017 at Kith, the streetwear brand and store, working as the women's creative lead. She saw the more traditional fashion job as her exit ramp from media. But it wasn't the right fit.
"I didn't like working in an environment where there was no respect for a work-life balance," she said. She preferred "a very, very strong balance, sometimes way more leisure than work."
"I want a very simple life," Ms. Oberg continued. "We're making clothes, you know, we're not finding cures to diseases and viruses."
She was still consulting for other brands at the time, including Harmony, a Paris-based brand that she had once covered favorably for Complex. Harmony's founder, Mr. Obadia, described himself as an experienced "product-driven guy," but "not a fantastic guy when it comes to images and marketing." The work Ms. Oberg did for Harmony was remote, but she and Mr. Obadia kept talking, and soon she flew to Paris to meet him. They began dating.
"We said 'I love you' the very first day," Ms. Oberg recalled. "It was very intense."
While living between Los Angeles and Paris, they decided to work on a Sporty & Rich product drop together. When Mr. Obadia saw thousands of preorders roll in, he realized Ms. Oberg had something he never had: a strong following. He thought he could turn Sporty & Rich into a real, serious brand, not just a mood board with occasional drops.
Mr. Obadia, now 34, said he told Ms. Oberg: "You don't know how to manufacture items, you don't know how to operate a company, you don't know how to scale a company, but you have what matters the most. You have a true vision. So I'll do my part. You do yours."
Today most of Sporty & Rich's team is based in Paris with Mr. Obadia, who formalized his role as chief executive in 2019. (Ms. Oberg is still the sole owner of company, which employs about 25 people.) While he and Ms. Oberg are now exes, they are on good terms, they both said. There have been growing pains -- Ms. Oberg's near cancellation revealed that some customers were unhappy with issues in order fulfillment, which sometimes persist, and her brusque approach to customer service, which does not. But Mr. Obadia projected revenue to be from $ 28 million to $ 32 million this year, without any investment or outside funding.
The brand just rolled out the second part of a major collaboration with Adidas, and earlier this year released a 1970s- and 1980s-inspired tennis capsule with Lacoste. Ms. Oberg and Mr. Obadia are both tennis enthusiasts -- as a child, he dreamed of going pro -- and Sporty & Rich has helped lead the tenniscore trend.
"It's health and wellness as brand messages and aesthetics," said Marian Park, a fashion strategist who runs Miscellanea Studio, and who pointed to a number of newer brands emulating the same post-gym-Princess-Diana look, stamping their athleisure with similar tennis club-inspired logos and sweeping health mantras, like "sport is medicine." "Millennials and Gen Z, we're drinking less and smoking less than boomers, and we're all scared of getting older."
Ms. Park acknowledged that Sporty & Rich stumbled during Ms. Oberg's controversies in 2020. And yet, she said, "there is a huge segment of consumers that don't care about that or don't know about that and never will. As long as they're tapping into those lifestyle conversations around wellness and sport, it's always going to do well."
Bosse Myhr, the buying director for men's and women's wear at Selfridges in London -- one of more than 150 wholesale partners that stock Sporty & Rich -- painted the average Sporty & Rich customer at Selfridges as a 20-something woman "who likes to work out, who likes to be conscious about what she eats, and wants to look cool and relevant."
Mr. Myhr, who recalled meeting Ms. Oberg at a buffet brunch at Soho House in New York, cited the if-you-know-you-know clubby feeling around the brand. "You want to feel that you're part of it," he said.
That feeling is exactly where Ms. Oberg sees the future of the brand: clubs. She imagines creating "the place I want to go to that doesn't exist" -- a wellness center with tennis courts, a pool, restaurant, spa, naturopath "and colonics," she said, laughing. "For me, it's more about the world and the lifestyle that we've created rather than the product."
"This is kind of like a preview," she continued, waving an arm around her store-cafe-mini spa, which opens on Thursday, and whose bright primary colors were inspired by Esprit stores in the 1980s -- more sporty than rich.
"At first we had a different concept where it did go that more luxury route," she said. "Then I was like, 'Wait, this is not us. This needs to feel like us.' Just, you know, childish."

Decision on Kennedy Files Leaves Some Unsatisfied: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The president has finished a review first mandated by law in 1992, and while a vast majority of papers related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy have been released, some remain redacted.
On June 22, 1962, an intelligence official drafted a memo summarizing a letter intercepted between Lee Harvey Oswald and his mother. The memo was made public long ago. But for 60 years, the name of the letter opener was kept secret.
Now it can finally be told: According to an unredacted copy of the memo released recently by the government, the official who intercepted Oswald's mail for the C.I.A. in the months before President John F. Kennedy was assassinated was named Reuben Efron.
And that means -- what, exactly? A tantalizing clue to unraveling a complicated conspiracy that the government has sought to cover up for decades? Additional proof that the C.I.A. knew more about Oswald than initially acknowledged? Or a minor detail withheld all this time because of bureaucratic imperatives irrelevant to the question of whether Oswald was the lone gunman on the fateful day?
The mystery of Reuben Efron, who has been dead for three decades, may never be resolved to the satisfaction of some of those dedicated to studying the assassination. Thirty years after Congress ordered that papers related to the killing be made public with limited exceptions, President Biden has declared that he has made his "final certification" of files to be released, even though 4,684 documents remain withheld in whole or in part. Going forward, agencies will decide any future disclosures that may be warranted by the passage of time.
The president's certification, issued at 6:36 p.m. on the Friday before the long Fourth of July holiday weekend, when it would not draw much attention, has frustrated researchers and historians still focused on the most sensational American murder of the 20th century. But they suffered a setback on Friday when a federal judge refused to block Mr. Biden's order.
Jefferson Morley, the editor of the blog JFK Facts and the author of several books on the C.I.A., said the belated identification of Efron indicated that intelligence agencies still had something to keep from the American public.
"If they hid this guy's name for 61 years and they're still hiding other stuff, I would say they're still hiding sources and methods around Oswald," Mr. Morley said. "Why else did the name remain secret for 61 years? The C.I.A. is trying to slam the door now, and Biden's gone along with this."
From the other side of the spectrum, Gerald Posner, the author of "Case Closed," a 1993 book concluding that Oswald killed Kennedy on his own, said he doubted there was a smoking gun in the remaining files.
"Everyone is focused on the C.I.A. documents still withheld," he said. "What we have learned from the C.I.A. files released this year is that they either have nothing to do with the assassination, or are only tangentially related."
While he and Mr. Morley diverge on the historical evidence, Mr. Posner agreed that Mr. Biden's decision was "an abrogation of responsibility under the 1992 law" mandating release of the documents. Trust in the government being what it is, he said, the public will never accept official reassurances that there is no stunning revelation in the papers.
"I don't think that's there," he said, "but you'll only know when you have all the files available."
The intense interest in Kennedy conspiracy theories prompted Congress to pass the 1992 law mandating that documents related to the assassination be released within 25 years except those that could do "identifiable harm" to national security that outweighs the value of disclosure. When the deadline arrived in 2017, President Donald J. Trump, who has dabbled in conspiracy theories about the assassination himself, bowed to pressure from intelligence agencies to grant more time. After taking office, Mr. Biden signed two memos doing the same.
Of roughly 320,000 documents reviewed since the law passed, 99 percent have been disclosed, according to the National Archives and Records Administration. But 2,140 documents remain fully or partially withheld as a result of Mr. Biden's action, officials said, while another 2,502 remain withheld for reasons outside the president's purview, like court-ordered seals, grand jury secrecy rules, tax privacy limits or restrictions imposed by people who donated papers, and 42 for a mix of both.
A vast majority of excluded documents have actually been released but with certain parts redacted, officials said, including names of people still living, addresses, telephone or Social Security numbers, or locations of intelligence facilities. Officials said they were confident that none of the withheld information would change the essential understanding of the assassination.
While Mr. Biden's June 30 order means he is done, the archives and agencies have set up "transparency plans" so remaining redactions can be lifted in the future, such as upon the death of someone whose identity was protected.
The Mary Ferrell Foundation, an organization already suing the government over the files, sought an injunction against Mr. Biden after his latest order. But Judge Richard Seeborg of the Federal District Court in Northern California rejected it on Friday night and dismissed other parts of the original lawsuit, though he allowed some claims to proceed.
Lawrence Schnapf, a lawyer for the foundation, denounced Mr. Biden's action. "It is simply unfathomable to me that a man who has a bust of R.F.K. in his office and who voted for the law would cave in to the incredulous claims of the national security bureaucracy that 60-year-old records pose such a risk to national security that they cannot be released," he said.
The Justice Department declined to comment but maintained in its filings that the government had complied with the law. The C.I.A. did not respond to requests for comment. "This completes the review of records required by Congress and fulfills the president's commitment to maximizing transparency related to President Kennedy's assassination," said Adam Hodge, a spokesman for the White House.
The assassination still has enormous power to arouse suspicion. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has embraced conspiracy theories on vaccines and other matters and is now challenging Mr. Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination, said recently that the government had orchestrated a "60-year cover-up" in his uncle's killing.
"There's overwhelming evidence that the C.I.A. was involved in his murder," he told the radio host John Catsimatidis in May. "I think it's beyond a reasonable doubt at this point."
Mr. Trump, for his part, vowed to do in a second term what he did not in his first. "I released a lot, as you know. And I will release everything else," said in an interview in May with The Messenger, a new online news site.
The final 1,103 documents released days before Mr. Biden's order and those made public in preceding months offered new information that hardly seemed worth keeping cloaked so long. In April, for instance, a file was released with names of employees in the C.I.A.'s Mexico City station, mostly secretaries and translators. Another document listed 27 previously unreleased C.I.A. staff members' names; for whatever it is worth, the C.I.A. director John McCone's secretaries were named Marguerite Beard, Betty Davis and June Irish.
Whether any of the withheld documents would shed more light on Reuben Efron is unknown. His name on the mail intercept memo intrigued Mr. Morley. The memo was sent to Betty Egerter at a C.I.A. unit known as "the office that spied on spies." On the day of the assassination, Egerter's boss told the F.B.I. that the C.I.A. had no information on Oswald, who in fact had been monitored when he moved to the Soviet Union. A document released long ago showed that the agency opened Oswald's correspondence from Nov. 11, 1959, to May 1, 1960, and again from July 1, 1961, to May 25, 1962.
Curiously, Efron was previously listed as being in the room when the Warren Commission interviewed Marina Oswald, his Russian-born widow, in February 1964 -- the only one present whose title and role were not explained. Mr. Morley suspects Efron was monitoring the commission's investigation for James Angleton, the legendary C.I.A. official, essentially his "eyes and ears inside the room."
Efron was born in Lithuania in 1911 as Ruvelis Effronas and arrived in the United States via Cuba in 1939, according to immigration papers that described him as a 5-foot-3, 135-pound "merchant-salesman." In addition to English, he spoke Russian, Lithuanian, Hebrew, Yiddish and German, and served in the Air Force during World War II as an interpreter. His obituary said that after the war he was "a specialist on the Soviet Union and consultant on foreign affairs" without saying for whom.
In a harmonic convergence of conspiracy, Efron reported seeing a U.F.O. in 1955. He was traveling with Senator Richard Russell, Democrat of Georgia, and an Army colonel on a train trip through the Soviet Union when all three spotted what a C.I.A. report called two "flying saucers." Skeptics later suggested they were Soviet aircraft. Russell was among the Warren Commission members in the room for the Marina Oswald interview that Efron attended in 1964.
As it happened, Efron died on Nov. 22, 1993 -- the 30th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination. His wife has died too, and he had no known children. Efforts to reach other family members were unsuccessful.
"People say there's nothing significant in these files?" Mr. Morley said. "Bingo! Here's the guy who was reading Oswald's mail, a detail they failed to share until now. You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to think it's suspicious."
Mr. Posner finds it less suspicious but understands why others might. "Many of us have made up our minds," he said. "Some of us have made up our minds that there was a conspiracy, and some of us have made up our minds that it was Oswald.
"But in the end, we all want to see these files."

Full text: For a brief moment, after Celine canceled its men's wear show in Paris because of the recent unrest in France, there were concerns about whether last week's couture shows would go as planned. But by the time guests started to arrive at Alaïa, one of the first events of couture week, dutifully carrying the custom chairs that the brand had sent them to sit on, it had become clear: The shows would go on.
At Schiaparelli, gold adornments and the house's signature Surrealist details were on full display. Thom Browne, for his debut couture show, turned an opera house into a wonderland full of fantastical suiting. Valentino showed ethereal gowns against the backdrop of the Château de Chantilly, a palatial property outside Paris and one of the most extraordinary venues I've ever photographed. Cardi B, who sat in several front rows, was seemingly the must-have celebrity guest of the season.
In the crowds outside the shows, there was noticeably less peacocking. Some people retired bright palettes for more subdued monochromatic looks. Others traded boxy clothes, which have dominated the style of guests and fans in recent years, for pieces with softer, more fluid silhouettes.

As Businesses Quickly Find Uses for A.I., Tech Companies Rush to Offer Products: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Amazon, Box, Salesforce, Oracle and others have recently rolled out A.I.-related products to help workplaces become more efficient and productive.
Earlier this year, Mark Austin, the vice president of data science at AT&T, noticed that some of the company's developers had started using the ChatGPT chatbot at work. When the developers got stuck, they asked ChatGPT to explain, fix or hone their code.
It seemed to be a game-changer, Mr. Austin said. But since ChatGPT is a publicly available tool, he wondered if it was secure for businesses to use.
So in January, AT&T tried a product from Microsoft called Azure OpenAI Services that lets businesses build their own A.I.-powered chatbots. AT&T used it to create a proprietary A.I. assistant, Ask AT&T, which helps its developers automate their coding process. AT&T's customer service representatives also began using the chatbot to help summarize their calls, among other tasks.
"Once they realize what it can do, they love it," Mr. Austin said. Forms that once took hours to complete needed only two minutes with Ask AT&T so employees could focus on more complicated tasks, he said, and developers who used the chatbot increased their productivity by 20 to 50 percent.
AT&T is one of many businesses eager to find ways to tap the power of generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers chatbots and that has gripped Silicon Valley with excitement in recent months. Generative A.I. can produce its own text, photos and video in response to prompts, capabilities that can help automate tasks such as taking meeting minutes and cut down on paperwork.
To meet this new demand, tech companies are racing to introduce products for businesses that incorporate generative A.I. Over the past three months, Amazon, Box and Cisco have unveiled plans for generative A.I.-powered products that produce code, analyze documents and summarize meetings. Salesforce also recently rolled out generative A.I. products used in sales, marketing and its Slack messaging service, while Oracle announced a new A.I. feature for human resources teams.
These companies are also investing more in A.I. development. In May, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures, the venture capital arm of Salesforce, invested in Cohere, a Toronto start-up focused on generative A.I. for business use. Oracle is also reselling Cohere's technology.
"I think this is a complete breakthrough in enterprise software," Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, said of generative A.I. He called it "this incredibly exciting opportunity where, for the first time ever, you can actually start to understand what's inside of your data in a way that wasn't possible before."
Many of these tech companies are following Microsoft, which has invested $ 13 billion in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. In January, Microsoft made Azure OpenAI Service available to customers, who can then access OpenAI's technology to build their own versions of ChatGPT. As of May, the service had 4,500 customers, said John Montgomery, a Microsoft corporate vice president.
For the most part, tech companies are now rolling out four kinds of generative A.I. products for businesses: features and services that generate code for software engineers, create new content such as sales emails and product descriptions for marketing teams, search company data to answer employee questions, and summarize meeting notes and lengthy documents.
"It is going to be a tool that is used by people to accomplish what they are already doing," said Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at the I.T. research and consulting firm Gartner.
But using generative A.I. in workplaces has risks. Chatbots can produce inaccuracies and misinformation, provide inappropriate responses and leak data. A.I. remains largely unregulated.
In response to these issues, tech companies have taken some steps. To prevent data leakage and to enhance security, some have engineered generative A.I. products so they do not keep a customer's data.
When Salesforce last month introduced AI Cloud, a service with nine generative A.I.-powered products for businesses, the company included a "trust layer" to help mask sensitive corporate information to stop leaks and promised that what users typed into these products would not be used to retrain the underlying A.I. model.
Similarly, Oracle said that customer data would be kept in a secure environment while training its A.I. model and added that it would not be able to see the information.
Salesforce offers AI Cloud starting at $ 360,000 annually, with the cost rising depending on the amount of usage. Microsoft charges for Azure OpenAI Service based on the version of OpenAI technology that a customer chooses, as well as the amount of usage.
For now, generative A.I. is used mainly in workplace scenarios that carry low risks -- instead of highly regulated industries -- with a human in the loop, said Beena Ammanath, the executive director of the Deloitte A.I. Institute, a research center of the consulting firm. A recent Gartner survey of 43 companies found that over half the respondents have no internal policy on generative A.I.
"It is not just about being able to use these new tools efficiently, but it is also about preparing your work force for the new kinds of work that might evolve," Ms. Ammanath said. "There is going to be new skills needed."
Panasonic Connect, part of the Japanese electronics company Panasonic, began using Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to make its own chatbot in February. Today, its employees ask the chatbot 5,000 questions a day about everything from drafting emails to writing code.
While Panasonic Connect had expected its engineers to be the main users of the chatbot, other departments -- such as legal, accounting and quality assurance -- also turned to it to help summarize legal documents, brainstorm solutions to improve product quality and other tasks, said Judah Reynolds, Panasonic Connect's marketing and communications chief.
"Everyone started using it in ways that we didn't even foresee ourselves," he said. "So people are really taking advantage of it."

For now, generative AI is used mainly in workplace scenarios that carry low risks — instead of highly regulated industries — with a human in the loop, said Beena Ammanath, the executive director of the Deloitte AI Institute, a research center of the consulting firm. A recent Gartner survey of 43 companies found that more than half the respondents have no internal policy on generative AI.
“It is not just about being able to use these new tools efficiently, but it is also about preparing your workforce for the new kinds of work that might evolve,” Ammanath said. “There is going to be new skills needed.”
Panasonic Connect, part of the Japanese electronics company Panasonic, began using Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service to make its own chatbot in February. Today, its employees ask the chatbot 5,000 questions a day about everything from drafting emails to writing code.
While Panasonic Connect had expected its engineers to be the main users of the chatbot, other departments — such as legal, accounting and quality assurance — also turned to it to help summarize legal documents, brainstorm solutions to improve product quality and conduct other tasks, said Judah Reynolds, Panasonic Connect’s marketing and communications chief.
“Everyone started using it in ways that we didn’t even foresee ourselves,” he said. “So people are really taking advantage of it.”

Full text: Beka Gvishiani started as a fan, with little access to powerful people in fashion. Now he's at every show.
What does it take these days to become one of the most sought-after people reporting from fashion's front row? Beka Gvishiani, the man behind the hit Instagram account Style Not Com, will tell you, in the same straightforward language that defines Style Not Com, nostalgically named for Style.com, the groundbreaking Condé Nast site that brought runway fashion to the internet in 2000. (Style.com shut down and morphed into Vogue Runway in 2015.)
"The day Style.com closed, I thought, 'OK, there is no more Style.com. Sorry, Style not Com,"' Mr. Gvishiani said, explaining on a Zoom call from his new apartment in Paris how he came up with the name of his account. His feed, on which he posts bits of news, fashion trivia and his version of event coverage, is a sea of Yves Klein blue squares with white all-cap text, like a fashion "Jeopardy!" Infectiously enthusiastic, it has become an important newswire and bulletin for the fashion world.
Last week Mr. Gvishiani was at men's fashion week in Paris, where he seemed to be at every show. Sample dispatches read:
"It's Very, Very, Very Hot Inside Dior Show Venue."
"So, Pharrell Owned and Literally Shut Down Paris Tonight."
"I think we have to change the word 'Love' with 'Loewe.' I Loewe You."
What Mr. Gvishiani lacks in depth, he makes up for in good vibes. Sometimes he wishes designers and other industry veterans a happy birthday. Sometimes he calls out a P.R. firm or production team for doing a good job. The brands, which have an increasingly iron grip on the media, love the lack of criticism. (Or do they Loewe it?)
Flattery Will Get You Everywhere
Less than two years ago, Mr. Gvishiani, now 32, was a fashion obsessive who arrived at Paris Fashion Week from his home in Tbilisi, Georgia, with little more than a font and a dream.
It was September 2021, when fashion, like the rest of world, was still in a coronavirus fugue state. Mr. Gvishiani had only a few hundred followers, but a couple of influential ones, like the fashion documentarian Loïc Prigent, who started following Style Not Com after he was featured in a post.
Mr. Gvishiani wasn't invited to any fashion shows then, but he covered the Balenciaga show -- formatted like a red carpet before a screening of a special Balenciaga-themed episode of "The Simpsons" -- as if he were there.
"Lots of people started to share this post, even the Balenciaga P.R. team," Mr. Gvishiani said. Posting that the Chanel show will start in five minutes or that only one model wore sunglasses was, as Mr. Gvishiani said, "stuff that no one talks about and is at some point kind of stupid." Unless you're the person who's responsible for putting sunglasses on the model or making sure the show starts on time.
"They are behind the scenes, but they are very important people to create those fashion shows," said Mr. Gvishiani, who used to be one of those people, back in Tbilisi.
When Lucien Pages, who runs a namesake P.R. firm, saw a fawning post by Mr. Gvishiani in September 2021 -- he called it "the P.R. Agency of All Fashion Brands Dreams" -- he had mixed emotions. Mr. Pages's firm represents clients like JW Anderson, Coperni and Courrèges and handles events and fashion shows for houses like Saint Laurent and Loewe.
"It could have been a fake account or someone that is laughing about people from fashion," Mr. Pages said. "I was a bit like: 'What is that? Is it good? Is it bad? Is it cynical?' But he attracted my attention, so it was kind of smart."
By January 2022, Style Not Com had accrued about 10,000 followers. Bottega Veneta sought Mr. Gvishiani out. Clara Cornet, Instagram's head of fashion and beauty partnerships for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, set up a meeting. Her job is to identity Instagram accounts with potential and make sure they're maximizing engagement on the platform.
Mr. Gvishiani sent Ms. Cornet his wish list of shows he would like to attend during Paris Fashion Week. "I literally sent the full Paris fashion calendar," he said. "She started sending emails to all these big fashion P.R.s." The invitations followed. Including from Mr. Pages, who was charmed by Mr. Gvishiani's positivity and unapologetic fandom.
"We put him front row, and Loïc Prigent came to me and said: 'Wow, you put Style Not Com front row. That's brave.' I said, 'Well, why not?"'
A Lot of Logic and a Little Luck
Mr. Gvishiani is no rube. His trip to Paris in fall 2021 was an inflection point, and in the course of our three-and-a-half-hour interview he spared no detail about how he got from Point A -- a kid in Georgia blogging on the Fashion Spot, an online forum for fashion fans -- to Point B, on a chartered boat to see Pharrell Williams's fashion debut at Louis Vuitton.
"I'm the first generation of post-Soviet kids," Mr. Gvishiani said. "I lived this period when we were getting teasers of the outside world." A childhood obsession with graphics, logos and branding from Western entities -- Fanta, Coca-Cola, newspapers, tabloids -- led to his holy grail: glossy magazines, specifically Vogue Russia, available at only a few newsstands in his town.
"The ladies selling it used to keep me one copy," he said. On his Tumblr account, Glossy Newsstand, he curated covers and fashion features from as many international magazines as he could find on the internet. He searched management sites like Streeters and Art Partner to figure out who worked on the shoots -- hair and makeup artists, stylists, photographers, models -- tweeting and tagging them. Some followed back.
In 2013, Mr. Gvishiani requested accreditation for Tbilisi Fashion Week. "They thought I was some important fashion blogger," he said. Eventually a Georgian designer named Anouki Areshidze hired him to run social media for her Anouki label. Soon he was ordering fabric, packing boxes, producing look-book shoots, opening her first store in Tbilisi.
When Ms. Areshidze participated in a showroom for Georgian designers in Paris, she sent Mr. Gvishiani. Harvey Nichols Hong Kong placed an order. Anouki was invited to a designer showcase organized by Vogue and Yoox in Milan.
"Since the brand name was starting with A, we were usually the first one in the room, first one in the list," Mr. Gvishiani said. "Sometimes it's a lucky moment." Anna Wintour and Franca Sozzani, the famed Vogue Italia editor, stopped at Anouki first. Mr. Gvishiani took a photo with them and posted it to Instagram.
In one season, he said, 10 more stores picked up Anouki to sell.
After five years with Anouki, Mr. Gvishiani opened a creative agency named Arial Bold after the basic computer font. "Our idea was to take the very basic and general ideas but make them bold and recognizable in a different way," he said. He produced ad campaigns and fashion shows for Georgian designers as well as a Giambattista Valli x H&M event in Tbilisi.
Spring 2021 was the peak of the pandemic in Georgia. Everything was on hold. Mr. Gvishiani had just turned 30. He started Style Not Com. He bought a ticket to Paris.
Mr. Gvishiani does not consider himself a journalist or a critic, though he is highly reverential of those who are. Meeting Tim Blanks and Nicole Phelps, two veteran fashion journalists and critics, who were the faces of Style.com in its heyday, were fashion dreams come true.
What do Mr. Blanks, who now works for The Business of Fashion, and Ms. Phelps, who is the executive editor of Vogue Runway, think of Style Not Com?
"What he does is very different from what we did at Style.com and what we do at Vogue Runway," Ms. Phelps said. "Those short little headlines, the white Style.com font against the royal blue. They work even better than pictures. You can read it in a flash of a second, half of a second, and you're just scrolling."
Mr. Blanks said: "He's a keeper of the flame, In his slightly pell-mell coverage of the whole fandango, he is pointing out, I think, this ludicrousness of it. He's also sort of the ultimate testament to the power of the fashion dream, this transformative thing that happens to people when they get into the fashion industry. It's this funny Lana Turner-in-the-soda-shop-aspect of this world, that they can become stars kind of overnight."
An Influencer, With a Loophole
Mr. Gvishiani does not use Style Not Com to post products or photos of himself at events, which is how most of his peers cash in. Occasionally he posts runway videos or a clip from an event he attends. He wears his own clothes, usually suits with Birkenstocks and a blue Style Not Com baseball cap.
"When brands pay for my travel and for the hotel and I get invited to the show, I already feel good," Mr. Gvishiani said. In June, when Saint Laurent staged its men's spring 2024 runway show in Berlin, Style Not Com posted "Saint Laurent in Berlin" against a black square instead of its signature blue and shared the time and location of the event in the caption. Mr. Gvishiani said the brand did not pay him for the post.
The honor of being invited to a fashion show does not pay the rent, however, and things have quickly become transactional. Many posts are negotiated -- the specific subject, whether it's a show, a campaign, an event, if a video is included. Then a rate is determined.
Last year, Mr. Gvishiani introduced a Style Not Com book conceived as a year-in-review, in which every page is a full-bleed blue square chronicling some fashion happening. The book sells pages like advertising, but which posts and pages are ads remains undisclosed thanks to a loophole.
"My account is connected with Georgia, where I'm not obliged to mention the sponsored content for the brands," Mr. Gvishiani said, declining to name his paying clients. "This is a reason the brands like to work with me."
With 227,000 followers, Mr. Gvishiani does not have the biggest audience, but it is packed with industry heavy hitters. "You're relevant in real life rather than with your number of followers," Ms. Cornet said. "Does it mean being invited to shows? He is. Does it mean being close to certain creative directors and being able to get them directly over DM answering questions after the show? He is."
Mr. Gvishiani is keenly aware that his invitation to the fashion party is conditional. He is not interested in criticism or analysis.
"My account became known because of its positivity, because of its humor, bit of sarcasm, bit of irony," he said, noting that he uses these elements in every post.
"When people get drunk, when they get super-personal, when they start to speak only bad things about people, these are the stories that I'll never share," he said. "Yesterday someone told me that I'm more valued for the stories that I don't share."

Fitting a Bathing Suit Into Your Wedding Day: [Society Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Beaded and bedazzled, fancy and frilly, lacy and Lycra-fitted -- bridal bikinis are here. Brides are embracing swimwear for after parties, honeymoons and even ceremonies.
Marigo Mihalos Sfaelos brought many outfits to her four-day, event-filled wedding in Karpathos, Greece, last year. There was the silk citrine Greek goddess-style dress, a floral appliqué Estee Couture bridal gown, and a disco ball-inspired floor-length dress for the after party. But the showstopper was worn at the post-wedding beach party: a gladiator-like metal and silver bikini with rhinestones, from the designer Karen Sabag's Rêver collection, along with a matching overlay skirt.
"I wanted it to be a bridal look that stood out, and the bride should stand out," said Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos, 35, a senior director of talent relations at SiriusXM radio in New York. She married Spiro Sfaelos, a 37-year-old restaurant owner, atop a cliff on Aug. 27, 2022, on the Greek island where she grew up. "You can't just wear a white bathing suit."
Other brides seem to feel the same way, especially with destination weddings, and designers and stylists are paying close attention. Today's bridal swimwear are not just fashion-forward white bathing suits -- they are beaded and bedazzled, fancy and frilly, lacy and Lycra-fitted, and custom made.
Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos said her bathing suit felt bridal.
"Like a bridal dress, it was a full statement," said Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos, who lives in Clifton, N.J. "It was a one-of-a-kind, custom-made item tailored to my body."
Like a wedding gown, Ms. Sabag, who also made Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos's second wedding dress, took measurements and did two fittings.
"As much attention to the wedding dress was paid to this bathing suit," Mrs. Mihalos Sfaelos added.
Samantha Brown, a professional stylist in New York, sees bridal swimwear as a trend that's likely here to stay. "We used to see brides wearing gigantic gowns on the beach, which never made any sense," she said. "They were heavy, dragging through the sand and out of place for the venue. Now, people are trying to find unique touch points that make their wedding memorable and photographically beautiful."
Designers like Marysia, Anemos and Giambattista Valli have sporadically offered swimsuit options in their collections, though they have not developed a fully dedicated bridal line.
Demi Raquel Thomas, a designer based in Marina del Ray, Calif., debuted her ready-to-wear bridal swimwear company, La Chenille Bridal Bikini, in April 2021 with a pop-up launch event in New York. The company concentrates on bachelorette parties, honeymoons and wedding wear.
"These are one-of-a-kind pieces that make brides look and feel as special as if they were wearing a traditional wedding gown," said Ms. Thomas, who plans to open a showroom in Manhattan next year. Her bridal line is currently only available on her website.
Ms. Thomas says she has seen a 25 to 30 percent increase in sales from 2021 to 2022.
Still, an overall lack of offerings has made finding bridal swimwear challenging. Elizabeth Paladeau, 31, the senior manager of special projects for Gucci who lives in Manhattan, said she had trouble finding a special swimsuit for her three-day Amalfi Coast Beach wedding last September. She said she "didn't find a trove of bridal swimwear options, because they weren't as trendy as they are now," she said. (She ended up wearing a Chanel white one-piece with black piping and a matching crystal netted skirt.)
In the past, Ms. Thomas explained, brides typically wanted just one or two outfits. "Gen Zs and millennials want five or six, for the ceremony, reception, first dance, cutting of the cake, after party and beach themed activities," she said.
Before plunging into the bridal swimwear market, Ms. Thomas spent a year immersed in research. She hired an online marketing company and acquired data and statistics about the fashion and wedding industry, among other things.
"This is a niche category," she said, "I learned 60 percent of couples were having or wanted beach or a pool weddings. I realized no one was offering a high-end, luxury look that was also comfortable to wear."
Ms. Thomas started out with about 20 pieces, including swimsuits, cover-ups and jackets, custom made with beaded and sequined fabric like organza and toile. Then, they are adorned by hand-sewn appliqués, crystals, taffeta, and trim. Depending on style and craftsmanship, tops can cost $ 600 to $ 800, bottoms from $ 550 to $ 800, and one pieces around $ 1,300 to $ 2,000. Full-length cover-ups can start at $ 1,800 and go as high as $ 7,000.
"We have a rose coat with 200 organza and toile roses," she said of a jacket that costs $ 6,000. "I didn't want to be a middle market brand." She said she is also looking into eventually offering plus-size pieces.
Ms. Sabag, who lives in Roslyn, N.Y., started Karen Sabag Bridal, in 2008, offering handcrafted, atelier dresses. Her designs range in price from $ 10,000 to $ 30,000 and beyond. Over the last several years, "more brides were asking for swimsuits," she said.
In November 2020, she created Rêver (which means dream in French), specializing in custom, hand-embellished swimsuits and lingerie. This summer, she will open her first Rêver flagship store in Gravesend, Brooklyn, offering 18 swimsuit styles and 40 interchangeable items, including cover tops, overlays and lingerie. Like Ms. Thomas, Ms. Sabag uses imported Chantilly and beaded lace, delicate silks, pearls, stones, embroidery and corsetry.
"I'm a detailed designer," she said. "These are high-end couture pieces that can be worn in the water, with a cover-up, and look like bridal dresses." Her swimsuits cost $ 450 to $ 1,200 while cover-ups range from $ 800 to $ 2,500.
Ms. Sabag says she sees more than 200 brides in a year, and about half of them buy swimsuits.
"That's a huge number," she said, adding that women who are not planning weddings "are also buying the line, and wearing our tops and cover-ups with jeans and pants. "There's a demand for this. It's become a recognized entity to bridal wardrobes."

Full text: In the third episode of the new season, Carrie displays her Covid style, and Seema tries to recover her stolen Hermès bag.
This article contains spoilers for Episode 3 of the second season of "And Just Like That ..."
In the third episode of "And Just Like That ...," the show seems to reach back to its "Sex and the City" past and pull out previously featured handbags and nostalgia for a bygone New York.
Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is recording her memoir and managing difficult memories of her deceased husband, John, by shopping and faking Covid. Seema (Sarita Choudhury) has her Birkin bag stolen in front of her apartment, and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), who is still in Los Angeles, is feeling so transformed that she decides to get a tattoo.
Ahead of the third episode, reporters and editors on the Styles desk discussed some of the most memorable accessories and thematic throwbacks in the latest installment of the series.
Vanessa Friedman I think we have to talk about stolen handbag déjà vu. When Seema's Birkin was taken, it sent me right down the rabbit hole to "Sex and the City," Season 3, when Carrie's Fendi Baguette was snatched -- and then a very similar Baguette reappeared in this episode.
Jeremy Allen Once again, purse as plot point!
Madison Malone Kircher That Baguette popped up in Season 1, too!
VF Handbags are the Proustian madeleines of this show.
Louis Lucero II A yearning for the days of Giuliani's New York? It seemed to be where this episode took place. And I don't know what's more implausible to me: the idea that a mugger in 2023 wouldn't recognize a Birkin bag or that thousands of pedestrians over the course of two days wouldn't.
VF Good point, Louis. How was that actually quite large Birkin just lying under shrubbery?
JA I was also struck by how Covid really became a plot point for the first time in this series -- especially sartorially. Carrie, of course, puts her own twist on pandemic-era athleisure. In the first episode, she pairs an oversize New York Times sweatshirt with, well, nothing, and in this one, she wears a Monopoly sweatshirt with a semi-sheer tiered skirt, Barbiecore kitten heels and an Oy Vey mask for her faux bout with the virus.
Callie Holtermann I caught myself laughing a couple of times during this episode -- sometimes with the characters and other times at them. Carrie faking Covid to get out of her obligations was funny. So was Seema's Louis Vuitton logo-print mask.
MMK I will come clean and say the final line made me laugh: "And just like that ... I got Covid."
VF I will also come clean and say I derived a certain amount of satisfaction when it turned out my prediction of more Loewe during our last chat actually came true, with the balloon heels in Carrie's Bergdorf Goodman shoe shopping spree.
CH Vanessa, I was about to congratulate you for this. The balloon shoes were one of the episode's bids for relevance that actually did work for me. Those shoes are crazy, they're everywhere -- and I can totally see Carrie buying them and wearing them to, like, a farm in the Hudson Valley.
JA An issue that "And Just Like That ..." seems to be constantly negotiating is having one designer-clad foot squarely in the past and the other tepidly in the present. It's clear the straddling can sometimes be uncomfortable for the writers -- but also, perhaps, for us.
Katie Van Syckle What tattoo did you think Miranda would end up with? I was expecting a robot.
MMK I don't know what I thought she would pick, but I certainly didn't think Miranda "The Brainy One" Hobbes was going to opt for tattooing her own initials on her wrist.
KVS With serifs!
LL Let's briefly venture into the speculative: What else might M.H. have stood for?
CH Max HBO.
LL Mondays? Harrumph!
KVS Mayor Hobbes.
MMK Anybody want to predict what we're going to see next episode? Sartorially or otherwise? Vanessa, you're already on the board with Loewe.
JA Miranda in jumpsuits for $ 1,000? Seema in zebra stripes? Lisa Todd Wexley in baubles that wouldn't make it past the T.S.A.?
CH Lily, Charlotte's newly rebellious daughter, gets a septum piercing.
VF Definitely Seema in more animal print. I think odds are high for a Chanel bag or two. More LV.
KVS More New York City merch and wearable New York pride.
LL Mark my words: We'll see Carrie in Rachel Comey's New York Review of Books collection before midseason.

Full text: So does the pop culture and fashion wheel turn.
And just like that, stealth wealth, the aesthetic made viral by "Succession," with its toxic billionaires in their Loro Piana baseball caps and Tom Ford hoodies locked in a C-suite cage match to the death, has been swept off screen.
In its place: logomania, branding that can be seen from whole city blocks away and accessories that jangle and gleam with the blinding light of bragging rights.
The outfits, that is to say, of Carrie and Co. in Season 2 of "And Just Like That ...," the "Sex and the City" reboot come recently to Max -- the streamer that, as it happens, also gave us the Roys in their greige cashmere. Both shows are set in New York City, the home of strivers and entrepreneurs, of "Washington Square" and Wharton, of constantly evolving social castes highly, and literally, invested in their own identifiable camouflage.
If watching "Succession" was in part like engaging in a detective game to suss out what character was wearing what brand, so insider were the fashion politics, watching "And Just Like That ..." is like attending brandapalooza: the double Cs and Fs and Gs practically whacking you on the head with their presence. (Warning: Spoilers are coming.) All the over-the-top fashionista-ing is back. The room-size closets!
It's the yin to the "Succession" yang: a veritable celebration of the comforting aspirational dreams of self-realization (or self-escapism) embedded in stuff that may actually be the most striking part of an increasingly stale series. Certainly, the clothes, which often serve as their own plot points, are more memorable than any dialogue.
Well ... except maybe for that instantly classic line in Episode 1, uttered by Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) on her way to the Met Gala in reference to her gown and feather hat: "It's not crazy -- it's Valentino." But that's the exception that proves the rule.
There is Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), with her multiple Manolos and Fendis, self-medicating with shopping, returning home one day with six Bergdorf Goodman bags. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) toting her Burberry doggy poop bag (also possessed of a Burberry apron and Burberry ear muffs) and bemoaning the fact that her teenage daughter hocked her Chanel dress to fund her musical aspirations.
Lisa Todd Wexley dropping her kids off for camp in a bright green Louis Vuitton jacket and scarf. And Seema (Sarita Choudhury), the character that passes for a restrained dresser thanks to her penchant for neutrals (and the occasional animal print), loudly lamenting the theft of her caramel-colored Hermès Birkin -- one of her totems of self, ripped directly from her hands.
There is Loewe and Pierre Cardin; Altuzarra and Dries Van Noten. There is also an effort to repurpose clothes, like Carrie's wedding dress, in order to promote the virtues of rewearing, but it's pretty much lost in all the rest of the muchness. There is a dedicated Instagram account on which the costume designers Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago share their finds, with 277,000 followers. @Successionfashion, by contrast, has 184,000.
All of which means what, exactly? Is the era of quiet luxury, so recently embraced by TikTok, already at an end? Have our attention spans, so famously abbreviated, moved on? Has the physics of fashion exerted its force and produced an equal and opposite reaction to an earlier action?
As if. In many ways, the fashion in "And Just Like That ..." seems to protest too much. In part that's because it seems like a regurgitation of the fun that came before, which was itself a reaction to the minimalism of the early 1990s, which itself was born in that decade's recession.
The fact is, no matter how much lip service has been paid to quiet luxury or stealth wealth or whatever you want to call it, and how it is 2023's "hottest new fashion trend," it was never a recent invention. It has been around since way back when it was referred to as "shabby chic" or "connoisseurship" or "old money," all synonyms for the kind of product that didn't look overtly expensive but was a sign of aesthetic genealogy -- the difference between new money and inherited money that fashion co-opted and regurgitated to its own ends. Just as more obviously coded consumption has been around since Louis Vuitton plunked his initials on some leather back in 1896 or since Jay Gatsby started tossing his shirts.
We've been declaring the "end of logos" and, alternately, the "rise of stealth wealth" for decades now. There are cycles when one is more ubiquitous than the other (usually having to do with economic downturns when flaunting disposable income is not a great look), but they exist in tandem. They help define each other.
Consider that during the current economic uncertainty, exactly the kind of environment that tends to fast-forward the appeal of low-key high-cost items, the most successful global brands have remained the most highly identifiable: Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Hermès. Or that in his recent debut for Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams introduced a bag called Millionaire that costs -- yup -- $ 1 million. (It's a yellow croc Speedy with gold and diamond hardware.)
What is more interesting is, as Carrie and the gang continue on their merry wardrobed way, how clichéd both styles now seem, how performative. Once they have trickled up to television, it's impossible not to recognize the costume. Or the fact that whichever look you buy into, they are simply different ways of expressing wealth, in all its decorative strata. And wealth itself never goes out of fashion.

Full text: Paris men's wear caught fire during a week of zillion-dollar spectacles, skinny fits and Jay-Z's surprise appearance at Pharrell Williams's debut for Louis Vuitton.
Models on Ozempic, dazzling guys in sequins, superstars everywhere you turned: Look, it's King James! Sheesh, there goes Rihanna! OMG, Beyoncé! Those screams you're hearing? Fangirls losing their minds for Cha Eun-woo, the pretty singer from the K-pop boy group Astro.
The week just past was emphatically one of fashion as an S.E.O. experiment, test field for an ever-evolving global ecology, increasingly monocultural, of luxury goods. Yes, there were talented indies. There were great masters from outside the mainstream, most notably Rei Kawakubo. There were some seasoned and celebrated, although not sufficiently recognized, talents like Grace Wales Bonner. There were survivors like Kim Jones at Dior Homme and lots of gifted comers showing men's and women's wear and, well, everything in between.
Take, for example, Marine Serre, who served up her most commercial riff to date on upcycled yarn waste and deadstock, here rendered as armor for warriors of the urban night (as well as molls in trash drag.) Let's hear a round of applause for an evening dress made from a granny afghan. Try rocking that one at the Met Gala, Lil Nas X.
Consider Rick Owens, showing in full doom-mode outdoors on the river-facing plaza of the Palais de Tokyo as if he had not seen a weather report. The predicted thunderstorms never arrived, and yet Mr. Owens showered guests anyway with drifts of gunpowder and wreaths of sulfurous fog from fireworks mounted on scaffolds and blasted into the Parisian sky.
The show was titled "Lido," after Mr. Owens's seaside getaway in Venice, yet it had more than a whiff of Burning Man. An observer would be hard-pressed to find clear connections between the soft littoral landscape of the Venetian lagoon and Mr. Owens's sternly constricting offerings: peaked shoulders like the budding wings of dark angels; high-waisted trousers with long hems trailing like the uncoiled wraps of a mummy's shroud; high-top versions of therapeutic leg braces and Brutalist "concrete sandals" -- perhaps the thing for one terminal dip into the Adriatic.
There were also studies in cool elegance, as at Dries Van Noten. Like the celebrated geyser, this designer can be counted on to deliver, sometimes with bursts from the creative core, occasionally with desultory puffs. This occasion registered as something in between.
That is, he provided uncontroversial gabardine trousers worn under trench coat skirts, twin sets for men, knit velvets, mousseline shirts teasing flashes of nipple and, most notably, sequined shorts. We have seen versions of this before from other designers. Yet such is the fickleness of fashion that suddenly they seemed eminently wearable.
Part of that is the Paris effect. Next to Tokyo among great world capitals, this city has the greatest capacity to frame the outlandish. Against its backdrop the clusters of Rei Kawakubo devotees strolling along the fashion rialto that is the Rue St.-Honoré -- in trousers with hoop-belled hems or deconstructed frock coats or other outlandish garb -- seem like welcome legations from distant galaxies.
Janet Flanner, the brilliant Paris correspondent for The New Yorker, once remarked that Picasso, even as a genius, had more gifts than he could deploy. Possibly the same could be said of Ms. Kawakubo who, like Picasso in his 80s, shows little sign of slackening pace.
"In order to find a new world, we have to go beyond reality," Ms. Kawakubo said in a gnomic note accompanying her Comme des Garçons collections. Of course, you could argue that the opposite is equally the case.
For the current collection, Ms. Kawakubo showed collared black frock coats in which waistbands were the hems of inverted shorts; double layered jackets; upside-down trousers; jungle prints; and Gary Card headbands embedded with what looked like flotsam. Oh, and there were the Oxford shoes right out of Meret Oppenheim. Were the wearers coming or going in properly bench-made, if Surrealist, Oxfords featuring two shoes per foot, either layered or headed in different directions?
Where Ms. Kawakubo is coolly cerebral Mike Amiri wears sincerity on his sleeve. When he took a bow at the end of his show with his family, it was hard to resist enthusiasm for this self-made Californian designer who, showing for several seasons in Paris, has urged his loyal consumers to ride along with him as he follows taste shifts away from streetwear toward soft tailoring, leaving behind the perennially juvenile cult of the sneakerheads.
Officially, Mr. Amiri's inspiration was a chill Los Angeles style. What it more closely resembled -- shirts and long shorts in leather woven like bistro chairs, silly flower embellishments, shorts-and-shirts like cabana sets -- was attire for rich Miamians. If you accept that geography is commercial destiny, next stop on the fashion caravan is South Florida.
In a packed schedule that proved the runway show is in no peril of disappearing, there were some shows that fell flat, like showroom appointments passing themselves off as something else. (Yes, you, Officine Générale.) There were bombastic statements like Kim Jones's anniversary collection at Dior Homme (he has survived there five years, a lifetime in the luxury goods trade), replete with fine boxy tailoring that almost made you imagine his next stop may be Chanel.
And there were moments of pure theater and elevated design. The best of these was produced by Jonathan Anderson at Loewe and staged inside the 18th-century stableyard of the elite Garde Républicaine -- France's version of the Royal Horse Guards.
Mr. Anderson often seems like the rare thought leader in the industry, a designer connected to culture in ways that have little to do with the trashy slipstream of social media. The fountains that were the centerpiece of his show were the work of the American sculptor Lynda Benglis, great bronze extrusions that suggested organic eruptions or frozen waves. They nicely counterbalanced the severity of Mr. Anderson's designs, which included trousers with waists so snug and high they turned the upper torso into a bust, boxy gray sweaters like Colorforms shapes and fully sequined shirt and trouser separates.
They called to mind the glittering '60s, specifically Andy Warhol's foil-covered Silver Factory, which, by coincidence, is being evoked by a show at the Gagosian Gallery on the Place Vendôme. "It was the perfect time to think silver," Warhol later wrote of the period and of his storied studio. Silver was both the future and the past, he noted. Astronauts wore it. Hollywood actresses from the Golden Age were photographed in it. Most important, mirrors are backed with silver. "Silver was narcissism," Warhol said. Can anyone doubt that he was, as usual, prophesying the next Age of Narcissism, that of TikTok and Instagram?
Given that, the commercial logic of Louis Vuitton's new chief executive Pietro Beccari's hiring Pharrell Williams to design its men's wear collection seems as irresistible as a bulldozer.
Let the naysayers cluck about Mr. Williams's design offerings, in some sense lost amid a zillion-dollar spectacle during an evening in which Vuitton colonized central Paris, taking over the storied Pont Neuf; painting it in the pattern of its trademark Damier print; and importing the Voices of Fire gospel choir from Virginia, Mr. Williams's home state, to sing a rousing composition of his titled "Joy (Unspeakable)" that tapped into Black spirituality as a promotion vehicle for unabashed materialism. ("If you want it, you can have it!" they belted out. "If you need it, you can have it!")
In a consolidated luxury goods sphere, where three groups (LVMH, Kering and Richemont) control nearly the entire ecosystem, market capture amounts to the one true religion. Designers are its missionaries, and on Tuesday evening, Mr. Williams seemed exactly like the person to take us all to church on the way to the bank.
The clothes, to the surprise of no one familiar with Mr. Williams's feel good music, were solidly commercial ("Every single thing will sell," as one retailer said.) Much of it was rendered in a pixilated Damouflage pattern that owed a debt to an earlier experiment by Mr. Williams's friend Nigo at Kenzo; lug-soled versions of the mid-calf rain boot Kanye West has been flogging for some time; Damier denim trench coats, suits, biker and varsity jackets; Mary-Jane shoes; and the all important Keepall, Alma, Neverfull and Speedy bags that, let's face it, are what Louis Vuitton shows are really all about.

PARIS — Models on Ozempic, dazzling guys in sequins, superstars everywhere you turned: Look, it’s King James! Sheesh, there goes Rihanna! OMG, Beyoncé! Those screams you’re hearing? Fangirls losing their minds for Cha Eun-woo, the pretty singer from the K-pop boy group Astro.

Governors Island Lawn Party Revisits the Jazz Age: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hundreds of time travelers in 1920s-era outfits took ferries to Governors Island earlier this month to attend the two-day Jazz Age Lawn Party, one of New York City's most curious summer traditions.
They wore flapper dresses with feather boas, pinstripe suits with black-and-white wingtips and lots of boater hats, cloche hats and bow ties. Gathered on picnic blankets in a grassy field, they passed the day sipping gin and tonics before dancing to hot jazz performed by the Dreamland Orchestra.
A man wearing pink pants and suspenders drank beer from a Mason jar while his young son, also in suspenders, sat on his shoulders. Lines gathered outside a stand that sold newsboy caps and another that offered on-site tintype portraits. A pie contest included the category, "Hobo's Choice," which rewarded the confection most likely to be "stolen off a back porch."
The orchestra was conducted by the pencil-mustached bandleader Michael Arenella, who started the event in 2005. "We were pretty much the first event out here," he said. "It was maybe 50 people then. People are drawn to the Roaring Twenties because there's a youthfulness to the era. After the war, people were looking to have a good time, after their brush with mortality."
In the edited interviews below, re-enactors on the second day named their Jazz Age fashion heroes and pondered whether they would actually time travel back to the era.
Cyrene Renee
If you could time travel back, would you? I'd go back. I'd be a showgirl at the Cotton Club and be the best dancer there. As much as I love the era, I don't think life was better, though. There was segregation. Yet despite what we were going through as people of color, we created beautiful dance, music and art.
Do you have a Jazz Age fashion hero? Josephine Baker, all day, every day. She was righteous and liberated in her beauty.
Inez Robinson
Would you go back? I can't romanticize that period, as a person of color, but I'm very drawn to the era's fashion. As a Harlem native, I have an affinity for the Harlem Renaissance. African Americans were using fashion to carry themselves proudly every single day.
Jazz Age fashion hero? Coco Chanel. Her designs introduced gender fluidity. She pioneered the idea you could go both ways.

Would you time travel back? People think of the 1920s as one big party, but it was just good for a few people of certain persuasions. It was also a time of intolerance and prejudice. I'd probably go back just for a weekend. However, this is only one time period I'm involved with as a re-enactor. I did a World War II event the other weekend, and I was at a Revolutionary War event recently in Mount Vernon.
Your old-timey fashion hero? Douglas Fairbanks Jr. He was married to Joan Crawford and was the best dressed man in Hollywood.
Michael Arenella
Would you go back? I'd like to go back, because I relate to the simplicity of that time. Don't get me wrong, it was a harder life, and lots obviously wasn't good, but things were simpler then, and I feel we've gotten further from that.
Jazz Age fashion hero? Gary Cooper. He was just starting out, and he had that elegant swagger. You don't see elegant swagger in a man these days.
LaVerne Cameron
Would you time travel back? Yes, because I think people were happier then, though I'd want to arrive before the Great Depression. Women's liberation was starting and so much of that fashion remains stylish today, from sequins to headbands.
Old-timey fashion hero? Carole Lombard. She married Clark Gable and died in a plane crash. She started the blond hair trend.
Jesse Rosen and Taylor Dunston
Would you go back?
J. R.: I think there are aspects of me that wouldn't fare so well then, but to experience those parties, I don't know .... If I could come back, sure, but I'd stay here if it was a one-way ticket.
Jazz Age fashion hero?
T. D.: I can't immediately think of one but I feel Tom Ford pulled heavily from this era. His suits are masculine yet use feminine color palettes. He loves a luxurious full lapel with strong shouldering, like the gangsters wore. You could argue the power suit was born in the 1920s and that Ford borrowed from it.
Michael Asante
Would you go back? I'd be naïve to say any era was better, but in terms of fashion, I'd like it if everyone still dressed like this. The mobsters in particular, with their red ties and cigars, were really bringing it.
Jazz Age fashion hero? I feel Karl Lagerfeld was channeling the Jazz Age. The gloves. The white collar. His white cat, Choupette, in a carrier basket.
Charles Annunziato
Would you go back? Probably not. The prohibition era was a time of hardship. Now we can get liquor whenever we want.
Jazz Age fashion hero? Bonnie and Clyde. Because they did whatever the hell they wanted.
Caroline Shaffer and Marissa Koors
Would you go back?
C.S.: Absolutely not. I like having the internet and rights as a woman.
M.K.: Only with a return trip. I have rights in this era and so do my friends and allies. We also have medicine. I could have gotten the Spanish flu.
Jazz Age fashion hero?
C.S.: Jean Harlow. She played unremorseful characters, like women who got involved with married men, yet she played them in a surprisingly likable way.
M.K.: Elsa Schiaparelli. She took from surrealism and said, 'What if we put lobsters on our dresses?' Wearing Schiaparelli was to wear art.
Alvin and Marla Nichter
Would you go back?
M.N.: I think I would have fit right in. It was a ladylike time. A time of gentleman. Girls were girls. Men were men. Wait, could I get in trouble for saying that? What I mean to say is it was a stylish feminine era, which I like.
Jazz Age fashion hero?
A.N.: My glamorous great-aunt. She was a fashion buyer for the top New York department stores back then. She'd go to Paris to bring back the latest fashions for New Yorkers. I've seen pictures of her. She was the bee's knees.

NEW YORK — Hundreds of time travelers in 1920s-era outfits took ferries to Governors Island this month to attend the two-day Jazz Age Lawn Party, one of New York City’s most curious summer traditions.
They wore flapper dresses with feather boas, pinstripe suits with black-and-white wingtips and lots of boater hats, cloche hats and bow ties. Gathered on picnic blankets in a grassy field, they passed the day sipping gin and tonics before dancing to hot jazz performed by the Dreamland Orchestra.
A man wearing pink pants and suspenders drank beer from a Mason jar while his young son, also in suspenders, sat on his shoulders. Lines gathered outside a stand that sold newsboy caps and another that offered on-site tintype portraits. A pie contest included the category, “Hobo’s Choice,” which rewarded the confection most likely to be “stolen off a back porch.”
The orchestra was conducted by the pencil-mustached bandleader Michael Arenella, who started the event in 2005. “We were pretty much the first event out here,” he said. “It was maybe 50 people then. People are drawn to the Roaring ’20s because there’s a youthfulness to the era. After the war, people were looking to have a good time, after their brush with mortality.”
In the edited interviews below, reenactors on the second day named their Jazz Age fashion heroes and pondered whether they would actually time travel back to the era.
Cyrene Renee, model and playwright
If you could time travel back, would you? I’d go back. I’d be a showgirl at the Cotton Club and be the best dancer there. As much as I love the era, I don’t think life was better, though. There was segregation. Yet despite what we were going through as people of color, we created beautiful dance, music and art.
Do you have a Jazz Age fashion hero? Josephine Baker, all day, every day. She was righteous and liberated in her beauty.
Inez Robinson, educator
Would you go back? I can’t romanticize that period, as a person of color, but I’m very drawn to the era’s fashion. As a Harlem native, I have an affinity for the Harlem Renaissance. African Americans were using fashion to carry themselves proudly every single day.
Jazz Age fashion hero? Coco Chanel. Her designs introduced gender fluidity. She pioneered the idea you could go both ways.
Skip Diatz, retired librarian
Would you time travel back? People think of the 1920s as one big party, but it was just good for a few people of certain persuasions. It was also a time of intolerance and prejudice. I’d probably go back just for a weekend. However, this is only one time period I’m involved with as a reenactor. I did a World War II event the other weekend, and I was at a Revolutionary War event recently in Mount Vernon.
Your old-timey fashion hero? Douglas Fairbanks Jr. He was married to Joan Crawford and was the best dressed man in Hollywood.
Michael Arenella, bandleader
Would you go back? I’d like to go back, because I relate to the simplicity of that time. Don’t get me wrong, it was a harder life, and lots obviously wasn’t good, but things were simpler then, and I feel we’ve gotten further from that.
Jazz Age fashion hero? Gary Cooper. He was just starting out, and he had that elegant swagger. You don’t see elegant swagger in a man these days.
LaVerne Cameron, retired paralegal
Would you time travel back? Yes, because I think people were happier then, though I’d want to arrive before the Great Depression. Women’s liberation was starting and so much of that fashion remains stylish today, from sequins to headbands.
Old-timey fashion hero? Carole Lombard. She married Clark Gable and died in a plane crash. She started the blond hair trend.
Jesse Rosen and Taylor Dunston, scientist and beauty sales executive
Would you go back?
Rosen: I think there are aspects of me that wouldn’t fare so well then, but to experience those parties, I don’t know …. If I could come back, sure, but I’d stay here if it was a one-way ticket.
Jazz Age fashion hero?
Dunston: I can’t immediately think of one but I feel Tom Ford pulled heavily from this era. His suits are masculine yet use feminine color palettes. He loves a luxurious full lapel with strong shouldering, like the gangsters wore. You could argue the power suit was born in the 1920s and that Ford borrowed from it.
Michael Asante, flight attendant
Would you go back? I’d be naive to say any era was better, but in terms of fashion, I’d like it if everyone still dressed like this. The mobsters in particular, with their red ties and cigars, were really bringing it.
Jazz Age fashion hero? I feel Karl Lagerfeld was channeling the Jazz Age. The gloves. The white collar. His white cat, Choupette, in a carrier basket.
Charles Annunziato, events coordinator
Would you go back? Probably not. The Prohibition era was a time of hardship. Now we can get liquor whenever we want.
Jazz Age fashion hero? Bonnie and Clyde. Because they did whatever the hell they wanted.
Caroline Shaffer and Marissa Koors, graphic designer and book editor
Would you go back?
Schaffer: Absolutely not. I like having the internet and rights as a woman.
Koors: Only with a return trip. I have rights in this era and so do my friends and allies. We also have medicine. I could have gotten the Spanish flu.
Jazz Age fashion hero?
Schaffer: Jean Harlow. She played unremorseful characters, like women who got involved with married men, yet she played them in a surprisingly likable way.
Koors: Elsa Schiaparelli. She took from surrealism and said, ‘What if we put lobsters on our dresses?’ Wearing Schiaparelli was to wear art.
Alvin and Marla Nichter, retired electrial engineer and retired fashion image consultant
Would you go back?
Marla: I think I would have fit right in. It was a ladylike time. A time of gentleman. Girls were girls. Men were men. Wait, could I get in trouble for saying that? What I mean to say is it was a stylish feminine era, which I like.
Jazz Age fashion hero?
Alvin: My glamorous great-aunt. She was a fashion buyer for the top New York department stores back then. She’d go to Paris to bring back the latest fashions for New Yorkers. I’ve seen pictures of her. She was the bee’s knees.

Shaking Things Up From Inside the Castle: [Style Desk]

Full text: Earlier this month, Pharrell Williams was in the men's atelier on the second floor of Louis Vuitton's corporate office in Paris, sunglasses on, surveying his new perch.
"Listen," he said conspiratorially. "This window is different."
The window by his desk looks out over the small plaza on the north side of the Pont Neuf, where in just a couple of weeks, his first show as Louis Vuitton men's creative director would take place. A 50-foot statue of the artist Yayoi Kusama, a Vuitton collaborator, hovered just outside. The rapper Pusha T and the streetwear innovator Nigo were milling about.
Since Mr. Williams's appointment was announced in February, he has spent a great deal of his time here, in this office and in the workshops that abut it, getting accustomed to holding the reins of the huge business he had been put at the creative helm of -- the first time a musician has been given such a grand platform in luxury fashion.
"I pinch myself every day," he said. "This is the equivalent of a castle to me. I mean, the Seine River right there -- it's like the moat."
The long path from his childhood in Virginia Beach through hip-hop producer stardom to streetwear design impact to pop music ubiquity to here was very much on his mind. "I'm a Black man -- they have given this appointment to a Black man," he said. "This is the crown jewel of the LVMH portfolio. It's everything, and I was appointed to rule in this position. So No. 1, a ruler of a position is usually like a king. But a ruler of this position for me is a perpetual student. It's what I intend to be."
A little bit later in the afternoon, Mr. Williams, 50, slipped off his blazer and slipped on a brown motorcycle jacket in full LV monogram print leather. Emblazoned on the back, in studs, were the words "PUPIL" and "KING."
His appointment to the helm of Vuitton's men's business is, depending on your perspective, a full-throated acknowledgment of the power of Black cultural capital on a global stage and a watershed moment in the absorption of hip-hop class politics into luxury fashion. Or it's a bellwether of challenging times to come for traditionally trained clothing designers who aspire to top posts, and a suggestion that global celebrity moves the needle more than directional design, even for the most successful luxury brands.
Either way, Mr. Williams did not apply for the job -- he was chosen.
In December, Alexandre Arnault, a scion of the LVMH dynasty and a longtime friend, sent Mr. Williams a text: "Please call me. The time has come."
Mr. Williams thought Mr. Arnault was perhaps going to run some name options by him for the Vuitton job. "I had been pushing somebody else," he said. "I had been pushing Nigo. My brother, always."
Nigo -- the founder of the brands A Bathing Ape and Human Made, the co-founder with Mr. Williams of Billionaire Boys Club and one of the most significant streetwear innovators -- had already been named artistic director of Kenzo, another LVMH brand.
Instead, Mr. Arnault extended the offer to Mr. Williams. "I had always wanted to work with him, in any way, shape or form since I started working in the group, which is already 10-plus years ago," Mr. Arnault said. "And it was just never the right time because either the companies were too small to work with someone as big as him, or there were already people in charge, or he was working with Chanel. And stars were so aligned now, finally."
Mr. Williams said, "I'm not calling it fortune -- I'm calling it favor."
Hiring Mr. Williams was one of the first decisions overseen by Pietro Beccari, a longtime LVMH executive, who was announced as chairman and chief executive of Louis Vuitton in January. "After Virgil, I couldn't choose a classical designer," Mr. Beccari said. "It was important that we found someone having a broader spectrum than being a very fantastic designer, which is great for the industry and we have many of them. But for that particular place, at Louis Vuitton, after Virgil, I thought we needed something more. Something that went beyond just pure design."
Mr. Williams signed the contract on Valentine's Day and soon relocated his wife and four children and much of his team. "Listen, I miss my house in Miami," he said. "And my house in Virginia. I really do. But right now, Paris is the center of the earth for me."
Playing the Game, or Not
His skin is as good as you think it is -- the additional pressure, or labor, or scrutiny of his new position has left no creases.
There was ease in his silhouette, too: a tight black double breasted vintage Vuitton blazer and well-worn white LV Trainer Snow Boots peeking out under bunched-up, flared dark bluejeans embroidered with faces derived from paintings by the Black artist Henry Taylor. The pants -- one of a few pieces Mr. Williams has deployed Taylor's work for -- will appear in the spring-summer 2024 collection, which will be shown in Paris on June 20.
He requested a tailor to come take a look at the hem of the jeans, which was a smidge too long on one side, and then sauntered over to the main conference table in the room, where he asked some colleagues to pull up images from his first ad campaign. It featured a pregnant Rihanna clutching multiple Louis Vuitton Speedy bags in primary colors, one of the first playful tweaks Mr. Williams is bringing to the company's heritage. The Speedy, one of Louis Vuitton's most recognizable designs, dates to 1930 and resembles a doctor's bag.
"I am a creative designer from the perspective of the consumer," he said. "I didn't go to Central Saint Martins. But I definitely went in the stores and purchased, and I know what I like."
He told Mr. Beccari something similar. "He said, 'I don't feel like a creative director here, I feel like a client,"' Mr. Beccari recalled, adding that he trusted Mr. Williams's natural instincts despite his never having managed a business of this scale. "I didn't even have to speak to him about the commercial importance of what he does and the importance in terms of turnover and volume of sales, but just the importance in terms of impact."
Mr. Williams looked at his Rihanna ads the way one might pose after a particularly athletic dunk. He pointed to one and said, "That's the golden ratio." For emphasis, he had an associate pull up the same image overlaid with the long golden spiral, the center of it landing directly on Rihanna's belly.
"What I love about this is, it's the biggest fashion house in the world, and that is a Black woman with child," Mr. Williams said.
Sarah Andelman, the founder of the pioneering Paris retailer Colette, and a collaborator of Mr. Williams's, said he makes creative choices "not just for the sake of doing things. There is a story and, I would say in French, profondeur, a meaning to what he will do."
Mr. Williams basked in the refracted shine from the screen full of Rihanna images.
"I know there's a game," he said. "I'm just not here to play it."
The Two-Decade Crash Course
Almost since the beginning of his career in music, Mr. Williams had found ways to incorporate, and create, fashion. In 2003, he founded Billionaire Boys Club with Nigo, perhaps his closest creative ally in style. Explaining the creative kinship between the two men, Nigo, through an interpreter, said, "The first time I went to Pharrell's house in Virginia, when I looked in the wardrobe, everything was the same as what I owned."
In 2003, Mr. Williams met Marc Jacobs, then the men's creative director of Vuitton, who invited him to collaborate on a pair of sunglasses. The result, known as the Millionaires, became a hip-hop luxury staple in the mid-2000s and an updated version of them is still sold today.
"He was just so incredibly generous to give me that opportunity when nobody had ever given any of us an opportunity to be creative," Mr. Williams said of Mr. Jacobs. (The Millionaires were designed by Mr. Williams, with Nigo.)
"I thought the way forward for Louis Vuitton was to collaborate with other creatives," Mr. Jacobs said. "It didn't matter to me whether they were from music or art or other fashion designers, whether it was Stephen Sprouse, Takashi Murakami or Pharrell."
Back then, when Mr. Williams arrived in Paris, Mr. Jacobs gave him vouchers to shop in the stores. "I was very nouveau riche at that time," Mr. Williams said, tilting his head down and offering just the tiniest hint of a knowing smirk. Mr. Williams also designed jewelry for Vuitton a few years later.
Other collaborations followed: Moncler, G-Star, Moynat, Reebok, a long partnership with Adidas and an almost decade-long affiliation with Chanel and Mr. Williams's close friend Karl Lagerfeld.
But none of those gigs had the complexity, or stakes, of his current assignment.
"Over the past several weeks he's had a crash course in design and how to run a studio and how to manage a team of 40, 50 people and how to take criticism and work with the people at the top because, you know, it's a blend of creativity and also running a business," said Matthew Henson, who has been a personal stylist for Mr. Williams for the last couple of years.
Mr. Henson is also styling the show, along with Cynthia Lu, Mr. Williams's former assistant who is now a quiet powerhouse of idiosyncratic streetwear with her brand Cactus Plant Flea Market.
When Mr. Williams walks through the studios, his awe for the specialized design teams appears genuine. "Presto, things get turned around so fast," he said. "I've had more resources than I've ever had in my entire life. They just don't miss. Like at all. None. Nobody."
That was something he was prepared for, in part, by conversations he had with Virgil Abloh, after Mr. Abloh was hired for this same job in 2018. In the three years at the helm of Vuitton's men's wear before his sudden death in late 2021, Mr. Abloh upended ideas about how a luxury house might function, and what story it might be able to tell in dialogue with those who had long been held at arm's length from luxury fashion. Just outside the atelier hangs the crucial, defining image from Mr. Abloh's first ad campaign for Louis Vuitton: a Black toddler draped in a "Wizard of Oz"-themed sweater, one of Mr. Abloh's first signature pieces.
Mr. Williams recalled Mr. Abloh's awe at the scale and efficiency of the atelier. "He would always talk about how they never say no, which they don't," he said. "So that's a responsibility not to abuse them."
Mr. Williams is now the second consecutive Black American in the role. "Over here, they lift us," he said. "They appreciate what we do. They see the talent that we have."
The Arnault family, he said, understands how crucial the Black American dollar and aesthetic has been to the growth and cachet of Louis Vuitton: "One hundred percent they know it," he said. "We've had some conversations about how important the community is to them, and how being supportive to them is a natural and a prerequisite."
He is looking to expand the house's brand ambassador program beyond the usual musicians and actors to Black academics, Black authors, a Black astrophysicist, even a Black bass fishing champion.
"They have to be supportive of the culture because the culture contributes to the bottom line," he said.
A New Humility
There are some things that Mr. Williams simply will not say. In public settings, at least, he speaks with the deliberateness of someone who wants no word to be misapprehended. His sunglasses stay on. ("I need something for myself," he said.) Rhetorically, he returns to familiar narratives and motifs -- the seismic changes in his life every 10 years, the eternal quest for learning, the continuing practice of gratitude.
"He never speaks the truth of himself, and I hate it," said Pusha T, who has known Mr. Williams for three decades. "It's my pet peeve about him. He knows he's great at things, but he wants that to walk him through the door versus him saying, 'Hey guys, come on. Let me through."'
Squint hard, though, and you may see the faintest flickers of the mid-2000s Pharrell Williams, a more boisterous and boasty person. A whiff of the old self popped out in a video Mr. Williams posted in late January, backstage at the Kenzo show with Nigo, when he knew he was on the verge of signing his contract. "You know what rhymes with 2023? Money money tree," he said into his phone camera, nodding intensely. He didn't lick his lips, but he might as well have.
When the appointment was announced, Tyler, the Creator, a longtime acolyte and style guru in his own right, FaceTimed Mr. Williams. "He just has this look he gives me where he kind of just goes like, 'Yeahhhh, I did that.' He didn't say anything," Tyler said. "And then he gave me the praying hands."
On his 2006 mixtape "In My Mind: The Prequel," a dizzying display of Dionysian ostentation, a peacock at the peak of his peacocking, Mr. Williams rapped, "We wanted this life, we salivated like wolves/ Blow a hundred grand on LV leather goods."
Mr. Williams almost flinched at the memory: "I was greeeeeasy on that."
Now, he said, "I promise you I really love being humble." But luxury fashion is not a business built on humility, and Mr. Williams is keen to make a splash.
The theme of his debut show, Mr. Williams said, will be "lovers." The first inklings of his vision emerged in April, at a Virginia festival that Mr. Williams organizes called Something in the Water, for which Vuitton made merch. It was received coolly.
Of potential negative criticism, Mr. Williams pleads equanimity. "I'm a student -- students learn," he said.
Mr. Henson said he didn't think Mr. Williams was expecting any "grace or favor" because of who he is. "He's expecting even more criticism and harsh critique," he said.
Mr. Williams shrugged. "It's not where my mind is, just because I think I err on the side of working with master artisans, and we're just literally working on the details," he said.
Staying Curious
An afternoon with Mr. Williams in creative director mode is a little bit like playing a first-person shooter. Requests pop in from unexpected directions, at erratic rhythms. Just when things get calm, someone emerges from around a corner with a mood board, or a vintage garment and a swatch of fabric it might be reimagined in. After being shown a hood with a novel but useful zipper, Mr. Williams nodded. "I don't want anything to be just for aesthetics," he said. "Everything has to have a real function."
For the second day in a row, he was wearing a Mickey Mouse T-shirt by Human Made, this time underneath a soft black leather biker jacket, and his flared jeans were in a Damier pattern.
A tailor brought out a mock-up of a double-breasted blazer for Mr. Williams to try on. One of the designers asked if he wanted "a very sartorial pocket" added to the design.
"Sartorial," Mr. Williams said. "Do you follow that guy on Instagram? The Sartorialist?"
For his first collection, he is leaning heavily on the checkerboard Damier print but reworking it in clever ways -- digital camo or, in Mr. Williams's parlance, "damouflage," and tweaking the colors away from the familiar browns and grays.
"Every season it's going to be a different colorway," he said, likening the playfulness to Takashi Murakami's neon monogram print during the Jacobs era. The soles of various shoes will be a modified Damier pattern. On a conference table were a pair of damoflage sweatsuits set aside for his parents ("My dad is a player," he said.)
Mr. Williams, who made waves in 2007 with his oversize purple crocodile Hermès Haut à courroies bag, is most tickled by the opportunity to innovate on the Speedy, which he is remaking in several primary colors, and also in an exaggerated, oversize silhouette. A yellow Speedy in meltingly soft leather sat on the pool table that serves as an impromptu work space in the atelier, almost slumping under its own very light weight.
"I want to give you that same experience that you get when you go to Canal Street, a place that has appropriated the house for decades, right?" Mr. Williams said. "Let's reverse it. Let's get inspired by the fact that they'll make some colorways that the house has never made. But then let's actually make it the finest of leather."
The day before, Mr. Williams had taken a moment to chat about designing a custom look for Naomi Campbell, including a zipped sports bra and zipped miniskirt, all in monogrammed leather ("'60s vibes, go-go"), and debating skirt lengths. "It'll work, but I don't know if it'll be as sexy," he said.
He also surveyed a pair of ship-shaped bag options, one steamer-like, one a bit shorter, and picked from various trim color and font options. "This seems to be the crispiest," he said, pointing to a white trim. He held one bag in each hand, then handed them to Nigo, who stomped off down the office in a mock model walk.
What Nigo did for Mr. Williams two decades ago, Mr. Williams is now doing for those who grew up admiring him.
"Me and him have a 20-year difference in age and man, what that does for me at my age is like, oh, it's still no ceilings," Tyler said. "To see someone at his age with his milestones, with his résumé, to not only still strive for a new world, stay curious, look for something new and something to challenge himself and let his creativity bleed into something else aside from just a drum pattern. And then actually get it. He not only strived for and did it, but actually nailed it -- it means so much to me."
Mr. Williams's new designs include printed leather jerseys and rugbys, quilted denim, Mao-neck blazers and ghillie camo with LV logo cutouts. He was excited to walk to the back of the studio, where the footwear designers work, and go over some eccentric ideas: Mary Janes and bowling shoes, a stone-encrusted snowboard boot, a design that initially scanned as a soccer sneaker but is actually a hard-bottom shoe. "I ain't even gonna lie," he said. "I was trying to do that at Adidas for years."
A little earlier, he was in front of his window, where he'd set up a small studio, and while fiddling with his Keystation 88 -- a keyboard and sound controller -- he asked his engineer to cue up a new song, tentatively called "Chains 'n Whips," that he was considering using as part of the show's soundtrack. Over a fusillade of psych-rock guitar flourishes, Pusha T rapped along to a pointed line in the chorus: "Beat the system with chains and whips!"
"That was made in this room," Mr. Williams said. "We just start walking around and looking out this window and you just see all of this. I mean, we beating this system, bro."

Full text: An arts program in a California state facility disproves the idea that "nobody dances in prison," encouraging inmates to channel their lives and emotions into movement.
Think of men in prison and you probably don't think of dancing. But that's what some at the California Institution for Men here were doing -- dancing for invited guests.
It might not have seemed like much: some walking, some running, a bit that resembled Duck Duck Goose. Yet the men were moving freely in an environment that restricts and regulates motion. They were moving together, suddenly vulnerable, physically open, trusting -- in ways that regular prison culture and the lives that led them to prison had taught them not to be. The dance was allowing the men to be seen, and to see themselves, differently.
The performance was the graduation ceremony for a new program called Embodied Narrative Healing, a class that is at once representative of changing norms in American prisons and quite unusual. From one angle, it's part of a nationwide effort to turn away from retribution and punishment toward rehabilitation and healing, sometimes through the arts. In California, after a funding drought in the 2000s, arts programs in prisons have been expanding since 2013, with programs in all state facilities since 2017.
What makes the class unusual is dance, which is much rarer than visual arts, theater and music in prison arts programs. One reason, offered by some of the men in Chino, is that dance goes against prison-culture codes of masculine behavior.
Amie Dowling, a choreographer and professor at the University of San Francisco with more than 20 years of experience working in prisons, pointed to another possibility. "Dance has a sense of liberation and agency," she said, and this can be threatening to "systems of control and containment, like prisons."
Yet the men in prison in Chino were dancing. How this came to be was both a consequence of shifting ideas about which opportunities should be offered to people in prison and a bit of an accident. Among those surprised by the changes were the two men who initiated the dance program from the inside and the French choreographer who was their unlikely collaborator.
"NOBODY DANCES IN PRISON." That's how Kenneth W. Webb recalled responding to his friend Dimitri Gales's suggestion that they start a dance class.
They were incarcerated at California State Prison, Los Angeles County, in the desert city of Lancaster. In 2008, when Webb was 17, he shot and killed an 18-year-old after a party. He was convicted of first degree murder and premeditated attempted murder and sentenced to 50 years to life. Gales was 19 in 2011 when he was involved in a gang shooting during which someone was injured (not by Gales). Convicted of attempted voluntary manslaughter, he was sentenced to 18 years to life.
By 2018, Webb and Gales were living on Yard A, the Progressive Programming Facility, where prisoners in the maximum security section earn admission through good conduct and gain access to rehabilitative classes.
Gales, who also goes by Buddha and is a brother of the rapper YG, was trying to teach a friend a dance called the Reject when he got the idea to start a class. "It sounded super crazy," he said, but he convinced Webb to join him and the two wrote a proposal emphasizing dance as rehabilitation. To their surprise, the proposal was approved.
They taught the class themselves, working out routines to hip-hop and R&B tracks for about 20 other inmates. This provoked jokes on the yard about twerking and "the skinny jean crew." But Gales was undeterred.
"We were going against a whole culture that defines dance as weak, like that's not what men do," he said. "People think we're thugs, but it's like 'No, bro, I'm really a regular person, and this is what I like doing."'
Gales and Webb were also taking other classes. Some were organized by Bidhan Chandra Roy, an English professor at California State University, Los Angeles, who had been so moved by inmates' stories that the mission of getting them out to the world had nearly taken over his life.
Words Uncaged, an organization Roy founded in 2015, borrows techniques from narrative therapy (helping participants reflect critically on their life stories) and applies them to the aims of restorative justice (repairing harm) in several Southern California prisons.
Many prison art classes are funded by the state through the California Arts Council. But hundreds more programs, like those of Words Uncaged, are run by volunteers and funded by private donations. These are often affiliated with institutions like universities, which provide subsidies and the kind of endorsement that helps gain approval from wardens.
Words Uncaged spreads the writing and art generated in its classes through publications and exhibits. It had nothing to do with dance until Gales and Webb asked Roy to find them a teacher. "They wanted a hip-hop person," Roy said. "But that would have just reinforced all the stereotypes we're trying to get away from." So instead, Roy brought them Dimitri Chamblas.
CHAMBLAS WAS FAMILIAR with places where adult men don't dance. He was born in one: a village in the French Alps. When some male ballet dancers from nearby Lausanne, Switzerland, visited his parents, he was fascinated by their globe-trotting lifestyle. He started taking dance classes in his village, the only boy, and when he was 10 left his family and home to attend the school of the Paris Opera Ballet.
At 15, he transferred to the contemporary dance department of the National Conservatory in Lyon, where he became friends with later-to-be-famous classmates Benjamin Millepied and Boris Charmatz. As soon as Chamblas and Charmatz graduated, in 1992, they choreographed a rough-and-tumble duet called "Á Bras-le-Corps," which they still perform.
Their goal was to break the rules they had been taught -- about concealing weight, fatigue and the sounds of effort. What Chamblas learned from this work, he said, was the importance of context. In one part, he rolled and sat on Charmatz's passive, floor-bound body. This was a formal idea: one body active, the other inactive. But when they danced it at a symposium about AIDS/H.I.V., it became about the living and the dead.
Skip through Chamblas's successful career as a dancer, choreographer and producer to 2017, when he moved to Los Angeles to become dean of the school of dance at the California Institute for the Arts. In 2019, at Roy's urging, Chamblas met with Webb and Gales and a few other inmates at Lancaster prison and jumped right into movement exercises in the mode of "Á Bras-le-Corps" -- the inmates sharing weight with their eyes closed, trying to dance big in a small room.
After that session, the men spontaneously started telling Chamblas their stories. He was so affected by their openness that he wanted a reason to keep returning. He came up with a long-term goal: A class of 10 would create a dance with him and put on a show for visitors. It was provisionally scheduled for April 2020.
THE PROSPECT OF THIS SHOW is what brought me to Lancaster prison in March of that year. Chamblas had told me that his weekly class was precarious, sometimes canceled at the last minute because the prison was on lockdown for one reason or another. But on the day of my visit, my security clearance checked out and my clothes didn't break any of the rules, so Chamblas and I were escorted through a series of double gates and across the sun-baked yard into the education building.
After all that control and surveillance, all this carceral choreography, I was surprised that Chamblas and I were left alone with the participants in a classroom like you might find at an underfunded community college. Everyone greeted Chamblas with hugs.
The men introduced themselves to me with their names and how many years they had been incarcerated, most in the 10 to 20 range. When I asked if Chamblas's idea of dance was what they had been expecting, everyone answered at once: "No!"
That released an explosion of laughter. Later, I would watch them gamely and creatively respond to Chamblas's French-accented prompts to stay physically connected to one another without using their hands or to let vibrations inside their bodies expand outward. If hip-hop dancing had met ridicule on the yard, these exercises were even riskier.
Chamblas was pushing them, as Albert Jerome Beckley Jr. put it, "totally out of our comfort zone," and they were grateful. What they most wanted to discuss was how the dance class, along with other Words Uncaged classes, had already changed them.
"We were hardcore gang members," said Beckley, who is serving a 50 years to life sentence for murder in a drive-by shooting. "But I've been able to find myself, and I like myself better now."
Beckley compared the class to a test. Daring to dance provoked taunts from other inmates, but where before he might have responded with violence, now he laughed it off. "If you can make it in this class, you have no fear of what anybody else thinks of you," he said. "That's proof of rehabilitation right there."
Some of this language could sound like a rehearsal for the parole board. But Webb, who talks like a philosopher and was not the only one to describe himself as shy, also spoke about the class as an extension of a community they were building to challenge the culture of prison and create "beacons of positivity." Now inmates not in the class were asking how they might join.
"It's the hope that we have," Rashan Greene, another class member, said. "They want that."
Words Uncaged classes had taught the men how to analyze their feelings; the effect of Chamblas's class was physical. "We know we can be aggressive," Beckley said, "but we had to dig deep into emotions that we have suppressed for so long. Sympathy, fear, sadness. And when I started embracing those emotions, my movements became more fluid. I was doing things I never thought I could do. I was superfly."
The dance work the men were creating with Chamblas borrowed choreography from their life in prison -- the freezing on the floor when an alarm sounds, the periodic roll call. Sometimes they recited barbed phrases from their pasts, like "You are irredeemable." But even the running and stopping, as in a game of Simon Says, and the carrying of one another was colored by the context.
Flickering between ordinary and extraordinary, this dance might have made for a powerful performance. But a few days later, the whole project entered a stage of seemingly perpetual postponements, as the prison locked down in response to a threat outside its walls: a global pandemic.
IN APRIL 2020, Gales told me over the phone how he and his classmates, now confined to their cells most of the day in the prison version of quarantine, continued working on dance moves that would fit those constricted spaces. "We really wish we could do TikTok," he said. "We would take over the world."
That June, Webb told me that he and Gales could now sometimes dance together on the yard. He was also allowed to visit the art room, and throughout the year, some of his paintings were exhibited in Los Angeles galleries and online. His mother, Gina, responded to his art with amazement. "This is his pain that I have never seen," she said.
Through 2020 and much of 2021, plans to restart the dance class kept being canceled. One by one, most members of the group were transferred to other prisons. Because of Webb's record of good behavior, he was moved to the lower-security facility in Chino. Gales, whose sentence had been commuted by the governor of California in recognition of the work he had done to transform himself, was released on parole in April 2022.
In Chino, Webb asked Roy and Chamblas to restart the dance class there. In fall 2021, they did, this time teaching the course together. The focus shifted more to trauma and how it lives in the body. Chamblas recalled doing a trust exercise with a new student, who was supposed to close his eyes as Chamblas took his weight.
"His body felt super agitated," Chamblas said, "and afterward, he said his body wanted to beat me." The exercise had released a repressed memory of childhood abuse.
During a class I visited in September 2022, several men spoke of having been abused and of their discomfort with physical contact. "I couldn't handle anybody touching me," Thomas Bolin said. Convicted of murder in 1981, he had been a member of the Aryan Brotherhood for more than 40 years, violently enforcing racial divisions in San Quentin and other prisons.
Bolin said that after making a promise to his wife while she was dying of cancer, he had enrolled in several rehabilitative programs. "But this is my No. 1," he said. "It teaches you to have empathy for yourself, as well as others."
"I still get angry," he added, but he described incidents on the yard "where the Tommy of a year ago would've put hands on somebody, and now I walk away." Duane West, a Black classmate, said that he and Bolin now have a "strong bond" and hang out together in public.
Bolin tearfully read aloud a letter addressed to his wife, reaffirming his promise. And then he put hands on his classmates, most of them Black or Latino -- lifting them, cradling them, letting them put their hands on him.
LAST NOVEMBER, the long-delayed show finally happened. The only original member performing was Webb, but among the 40 or so invited guests who filed into the Chino prison gym, was another: Gales. Looking a little stunned, he called it "a full-circle moment."
Although the performance was titled "Transformation," much of it appeared mundane. Yet because these men were inmates wearing orange jumpsuits labeled "prisoner," their walking past one another, occasionally jostling, took on an all-too-believable threat of violence. Similarly, the sight of a man running in big circles had a special impact in a place where such fast, free motion is normally against the rules.
Every time the men touched one another or carried one another, they seemed to defy the environment where such expressions of trust and tenderness are rare, even dangerous. This had a brave beauty.
After the performance, the men gathered with visitors and read aloud from the thoughtful, emotionally exposed writing they had done for the class. Visitors learned that some had been imprisoned for crimes (serious, terrible ones) committed when they were barely adults, and that some (like Bolin) were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. The men spoke about their families, their regrets and how they had been working hard to change. Inmates cried. Listeners too.
What kind of transformation was this? The effects of prison arts programs can be hard to measure, but a 2021 report by California Arts in Corrections summarized findings about how such programs help participants learn coping skills and heal from trauma, reduce anxiety and anger, form communities within the isolation of incarceration and reintegrate with their communities on the outside after release.
Brant Choate, the director of rehabilitative programs for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said that while "there is no special sauce for keeping people out of prison," arts programs "create a neutral zone" in places where people are usually divided by race or gang affiliation. And in that neutral zone, Choate said, they can change.
For Denise Herz, a criminology professor at Cal State Los Angeles, the healing-centered approach of Words Uncaged allows inmates "to create a new narrative of who they are and how they want to give back," she said. "Accountability turns into advocacy."
None of the more than 100 Words Uncaged participants who have been released from prison have been reincarcerated, Roy said. Many counsel young people. Webb said that this was his post-prison dream: "I can talk to kids. I can be of service."
But Dowling, the University of San Francisco professor, made a different point. "Why are we surprised there's talent and imagination?" she asked. "We've been fed so much misinformation about people in prison. The rehabilitation is reciprocal, really. We on the outside need it too."
In the parking lot after the show, Chamblas looked a little wistful. Earlier, he had told me about being in Paris, directing a fashion video for Chanel, and flying back in the middle of the shoot so he wouldn't miss the weekly class at the prison. "These are the best people I know in L.A.," he said.
Gales told me of his plans to break into the movie and fashion business and said he spent a lot of time with Chamblas's family. ("That's my boy, I'm always at his house.")
As I drove away, the image from the performance that replayed in my mind was of the man running in circles. Inside the prison, the freedom of that simple motion had felt shocking, and now the meaning rippled outward. The man was Webb. He is eligible for parole in 2031.

Full text: The 23-year-old pianist, drummer and rapper puts a pandemic-era spin on jazz-rap on his debut, "More Better," and he always keeps the faith.
At a recent Sunday afternoon performance in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill neighborhood, the pianist Francisco Haye sat behind a piano at Emmanuel Baptist Church, leading his quintet through a number of recognizable jazz standards. Yet they weren't straight-ahead: Songs like "All the Things You Are," "Little Sunflower" and "My Favorite Things" each had wrinkles -- a bouncy backbeat or a near-frenetic breakdown -- that made them feel fresh.
It was the kind of set that might rankle those who prefer to hear Ella Fitzgerald, Freddie Hubbard and John Coltrane without frills, yet these listeners -- made up of elders who have known Haye since he was a child growing up in the congregation there -- seemed to embrace what he was trying to do.
The goal, he told them, was to take "cliché jazz tunes and not make them boring."
Haye's artistry is informed by artists like Robert Glasper and Roy Hargrove, both classically trained jazz musicians who have blended the genre with hip-hop, R&B and rock, aligning the music with alternative rap and the neo-soul movement that emerged in the late 1990s. Haye, performing under the name Cisco Swank, plays melodic piano chords over lush soul and trap-inspired drums and raps in a manner that recalls the weary lethargy of Mike and Earl Sweatshirt, but with the polish of a Village Vanguard headliner.
Jazz-rap hybrids aren't new, of course, but Haye, 23, without pandering to any audience, is tapping into a subset who dig lo-fi underground rap.
"He's sitting right in the center of a lot of points," said the noted trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire in a telephone interview. "And it doesn't seem like he's trying to. It's just who he is. He is Black music. All of it. It's in every note."
Haye runs through the tapestry of jazz, R&B and rap on his recently released debut album, "More Better," which at times ruminates on the pandemic but without wallowing in despair.
"Teary-eyed still thinkin' 'bout 2020/Quarantined, bro, the streets eerie," he raps on "If You're Out There." "City full of dreams, concrete, but I see it when I look in the sky." On "What Came From Above," over a melancholic piano loop and stuttering electronic drums, Haye admits he is "renewed" back at home with his family. (He returned to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, from the Berklee College of Music, where he studied piano performance and contemporary writing and production when the pandemic took hold.) On "Over Now," he laments the end of a romantic relationship with keen self-awareness. "I try to smile through it," Haye raps with an exhausted tone. "I don't really like fast moving/I try not to commit, bro, I'm last to it." Even the LP's title -- thought of randomly during a rehearsal -- is meant to convey perseverance in dark times.
Haye, tall and skinny with long dreads and a boyish charm, peppers his conversation with affirmations like "facts" and "fire," and speaks easily and expertly about a wide range of musicians -- Beethoven and Bach, Kirk Franklin and Richard Smallwood. While growing up in Flatbush, he was exposed to all of this music by his mother, Adriane, who directed the youth choir at Emmanuel, and his father, Frank, who was the director of music there.
Haye's earliest musical memories involve playing drums and piano at the church, when he was only 3 or 4 years old. Seeing his father in action in front of large congregations sparked a real interest in music. "I feel like it played an important role in how I see people present music and how you interact with people," he said during a lunch interview. "The whole idea of just music being more than just notes and harmony. It's serving a bigger purpose, whether it's bringing someone out of a wack week or bringing them closer to God."
At home, he said, there were "mad musical instruments everywhere," which made being an artist seem like the coolest job ever. He absorbed Baroque music, Stevie Wonder and other Motown soul, as well as old-school rap. (His mother grew up in the Bronx at the beginning of hip-hop culture and used to rhyme under the name Micki Dee.)
Haye started thinking about blending genres during his freshman year at LaGuardia High School: His favorite rapper, Kendrick Lamar, merged rap and psychedelic jazz on his 2015 album "To Pimp a Butterfly," and Glasper's song "Portrait of an Angel" doubled as his alarm clock. "That really was the point where I was like, 'I'm trying to do something very much like this,"' Haye said.
He formed a jazz fusion band and started playing around the city. He began rapping as a student at Berklee, tinkering with the conversational cadences heard on "More Better" while releasing music on SoundCloud. "I was like, 'Oh, maybe we should just play this song with the band but put a trap groove over it,"' Haye recalled. "Slowly, it just started merging into what it is today."
He met the Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist Luke Titus over social media at the start of lockdown in 2020 and started sharing audio files with him, which led to the collaborative album "Some Things Take Time," released two years later. "The narrative was definitely about being patient during a time with so much uncertainty," Titus said over the phone. "It was about not forcing things and allowing things to come when they come." Those themes are also relayed on "More Better" in Haye's singular voice.
"He draws from so much influence of being from New York," Titus added, pointing to the city's renowned jazz and rap scenes. "He might have all these jazz chops, but he'll pick the simple melody and play what needs to be there in a very lyrical way." He added, "He's one of those rare guys who doesn't overthink things too much."
Haye noted that while his album was born of the pandemic, it's rooted in a sense of uplift rather than resignation. "It's just like seeing the clouds in the distance, like seeing the light at the end of the tunnel," he said. "It's being able to say, 'Oh, I can make it as long as I have faith.' Even if it's not a spiritual faith, if it's just faith that things will get better, it will work out."

Treasury Balance Looks Like Petty Cash to Moguls: [National Desk]

Full text: The cash balance at the Treasury Department is now lower than the net worth of some of the world's richest people.
The Treasury Department said its cash balance fell to $ 38.8 billion as of Thursday, as the United States inched toward running out of cash to pay its bills.
That was significantly lower than the $ 316 billion the department had in operating cash, which is held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the start of the month.
Just how empty is the Treasury cash coffer? For comparison, $ 38.8 billion is on par with the gross domestic product of Bahrain and Paraguay and lower than the net worth of more than two dozen of the wealthiest people in the world. Of course, much of the assets of those billionaires are tied up in stocks, rather than liquid assets.
Here is a list of people with higher net worths than the U.S. cash reserves, according to Bloomberg News's Billionaire Index as of Thursday. (Under the news agency's editorial policy, its billionaire owner, Michael Bloomberg, is not considered for the index. Forbes, though, estimates his net worth at $ 94.5 billion.)
Bernard Arnault, chief executive of the luxury group LVMH: $ 189 billion
Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter: $ 179 billion
Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon: $ 139 billion
Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft: $ 125 billion
Larry Ellison, co-founder and executive chairman of Oracle: $ 116 billion
Steve Ballmer, investor and former chief executive of Microsoft: $ 113 billion
Larry Page, co-founder of Google: $ 112 billion
Warren Buffett, investor: $ 111 billion
Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google: $ 106 billion
Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook: $ 92.3 billion
Carlos Slim, investor: $ 90.3 billion
Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, heir to the L'Oréal fortune and company board member: $ 87.2 billion
Mukesh Ambani, chairman of the energy group Reliance Industries: $ 83.7 billion
Amancio Ortega, founder of the Inditex fashion group: $ 67.1 billion

Full text: Welcome to Flamingo Estate.
LOS ANGELES -- Flamingo Estate, a lifestyle company set in a 1940s Spanish-style house in the hills on the border between the Eagle Rock and Highland Park neighborhoods, sells candles that smell like tomatoes and rosemary. Oprah Winfrey named them one of her favorite things.
Pink is a theme for both the brand and the house. Its facade is pink stucco. Its Pink Moon rosé was made to match the color on the underside of a flamingo's wing. The company makes botanical products, not all of which are obvious hits. Last Christmas, its infamous nine-pound sack of manure (using a synonym for excrement) that cost $ 75, went viral. It's currently out of stock.
For $ 80 before shipping, one can purchase a 6.5-ounce jar of dried strawberries dusted with guajillo chile and a squeeze of lime. They are snacks, yes, but also they are statements: If you can afford them, money is not something that concerns you. Everything is shipped in boxes printed with the motto: "We are a home for radical pleasure."
Though Flamingo Estate was named after the home of its founder, Richard Christiansen, the name implies something far bigger than the seven-acre lot he shares with Aaron Harvey, his partner (and the creative director of the company), and their dogs, Daylesford and Freeway.
"A potential investor just came over and was like, 'Wait, everything is from here?"' Mr. Christiansen said. "She was expecting hundreds of acres in the middle of Los Angeles." He had to explain that though Flamingo Estates, the brand, was inspired by his house he now uses ingredients from 110 local farms.
Mr. Christiansen bought his home eight years ago. It was once a porn studio, and he transformed it into an Instagram playland.
"It's over the top," said Martha Stewart, who has known Mr. Christiansen for years and wrote the foreword to the Flamingo Estate cookbook ( $ 78). "He buys a house on the top of the hill overlooking Los Angeles, and he transforms this ex-porn king's mansion into a veritable paradise of gardens and deep, dark baths and furniture that's crazy and good. He looks like a young boy with pink cheeks, and he's generous and thoughtful and busy, yet you never think he's that busy."
The vibe skews colorful and vaguely tropical. In the living room, there is a limited-edition David Hockney "Caribbean Tea Time" screen and a large floral printed sofa from the Belgian designer JP Demeyer, mixed with chairs and side tables bought at Parisian flea markets. In the kitchen, a terrazzo floor in shades of mint, white, black and rose is dominated by an enormous antique stove. Just off the kitchen is a small bar with vintage Baccarat crystal decanters and bamboo stools.
Mr. Christiansen's home is where nearly everything the brand sells is staged and photographed, and it drives sales. It has also served as a background for Quentin Tarantino and Margot Robbie to be photographed for magazine spreads, for Billie Eilish to be interviewed by the BBC, and for Emily Weiss, the Glossier founder, to host her baby shower.
It would be easy to mistake Flamingo Estate for a hotel or club. "I thought it was a public space that people could maybe purchase a ticket to, like a garden," Chrissy Teigen said in a voice memo. She asked Mr. Christiansen over Instagram if she could bring her family. "We pulled up and I knocked on the gate and Richard popped out, and I was like, 'Oh my God, wait, this is not a public entity of any kind."'
Mr. Christiansen gave them a tour, and her kids played with the chickens. "I fully believe Richard is an angel or an alien from another planet," Ms. Teigen said. "At the risk of sounding very L.A., he has this energy about him and this aura about him that's really special."
They ended up making three jams together -- as in the kind of jams one spreads on scones, not the musical variety.
A Man With Many Ideas
Architects from the French firm Studio KO did the renovation of Mr. Christiansen's home, basing some of the landscaping on hot weather gardens in Morocco. Surveying the grounds after an exceptionally cold and wet California winter, Mr. Christiansen sounded poetic: "The sage has exploded, the wisteria has purple blooms. The orchard is so joyful, it's like it's singing."
There are climbing jasmine vines and a cast-concrete bathhouse with a fireplace and tiles that match the Balearic Sea. Mr. Christiansen is interested in someday creating a Flamingo Estate "temple to bathing" -- inspired by the one at Flamingo Estate.
But he is a man with many ideas. Last year the company introduced $ 250 jars of honey culled from beehives placed in the gardens of celebrities, including Ai Weiwei and Julianne Moore.
"How wild is it that LeBron's honey on the Westside tastes completely different from Tiffany Haddish's in South Central," Mr. Christiansen said. He is still negotiating who will participate next.
Ms. Moore said the process was easy. "There is a beekeeper in Montauk he contacted, and she tended the bees and collected the honey," she said. "We continue to have the bees."
Mr. Christiansen stood with his dogs inside the goat keeper's shed, a space the size of a small office, full of jars with labels that read "fermented indigo" and decorated with custom hand-painted wallpaper from the British company de Gournay depicting local flora and fauna: cactuses, owls and cliff roses.
The dogs have a slightly adversarial relationship with the goats, who live in a pen with the chickens. On a stormy Sunday in February, realizing the goats were cold, Mr. Christiansen posted a call for cashmere sweaters on Instagram. "I was like, 'Oh, it's freezing, the poor goats,"' Mr. Christiansen said. Now the goats wear cashmere.
Mr. Christiansen stood overlooking proteas and mimosa plants that reminded him of his native Australia. His parents were beekeepers who raised him on their sugar cane farm in northern New South Wales. They didn't entertain. He was a kid obsessed with Chanel and Calvin Klein ads in magazines, who studied law and then went into marketing.
Flamingo Estate began as a pandemic project. After almost two decades at Chandelier Creative, the agency he founded in 2005, Mr. Christiansen, 46, was depleted emotionally and physically. The company worked with a lot of fashion brands and had offices in Los Angeles, New York and Paris.
Mr. Christiansen was living in Los Angeles. Chandelier was at a standstill in the early days of the pandemic. (He is no longer involved in the agency.) That was when he met a woman who was in danger of losing her farm because she sold food to restaurants that were closed.
He started selling her fresh produce to friends in $ 35 boxes. Word spread among other farmers who were eager to join. Farmers sold directly to Flamingo Estate, which paid them weekly in cash. "It was $ 300 that week, $ 600 the next week," Mr. Christiansen said. "And you know, it just kept growing. One farm became two, became five, became 10 and now 110. We didn't have any intention that it would become really a business."
"At some point we shifted to a model that was more structured, asking farmers, 'Why don't you plant stuff specifically for us?"'
Locals like Kris Jenner can still pick up farm boxes, but that's just one part of Flamingo Estate's business. Sales have doubled each year, Mr. Christiansen said, noting that revenue was $ 10 million last year. "We are about to hit profit this next quarter," he said.
Seventy-five percent of the customers, according to information provided by Mr. Christiansen, are women between 24 and 40 years old. They are split evenly between the East and West Coast. "The opportunity for us is in cities like Chicago, Dallas, Miami," he said.
"I really do think we've got these two customer segments," he continued. "We've got people who care a lot about the environment and about sourcing and about farming. Then I think we've got this customer here who's a luxury shopper, who thinks the house is curated and likes the brand and especially the collaborations we do, and sometimes they cross over. But very rarely, actually."
Making the Leap
The marketing side of Mr. Christiansen still burns very bright. Each Sunday he pulls the information on the top 50 customers that week and texts or calls them. "This one customer was literally our best customer over and over and over again," he said. "And I was, like, I wonder who this is? And then I had a lovely conversation with him. And then, you know, one thing led to another. Now that customer is an investor via a family office."
Mr. Christiansen, at first, courted individual investors for funding rather than venture capital firms. "I hate dealing with money," he said. "I don't even check my A.T.M. balance."
For all that, the Flamingo Estate brand just closed a round of outside funding. It raised $ 7.5 million, earmarked for working capital.
"We have left the kids' table and gone to the adults' table," Mr. Christiansen said.
"We spoke to some people who were green investors, and a number of them were, like, we'll only invest in organic-certified or regenerative-certified, whatever -- just very didactic about it. I said that for some small growers, getting certified organic is really difficult. It's expensive."
Mr. Christiansen is also open to working with large agricultural companies. "For me, progress would be that situation where people say we're far from perfect," he said. "The opportunity for me is to work with someone who's got room to improve. In our industry there's so much greenwashing. It makes me irate that people give themselves a pat on the back for one or two ingredients that are goodish for the world."
This summer, Flamingo Estate is opening a pop-up in an old auto body shop in East Hampton, N.Y., the idea being to bring your body in for a summer tuneup. The gas station snack section will be called the Inconvenience Store. There are books coming out later this year, including a workbook on how to live a pleasurable life and another called "House of Radical Pleasure," which will be a tour of the property divided by the senses.
Flamingo Estate, the home, is key to the allure of Flaming Estate, the brand, even if having one's home as a kind of living set and rotating dinner party can be annoying. Mr. Harvey, he said with a laugh, is frustrated with it: "He's tired of making the bed."
"Even though we've grown quickly, it's still super-personal," he said. "We make stuff that I want to use in the kitchen. I use the soap in the shower. I do all of the social myself. It's still my kitchen, my bathroom, my dogs and my trees."

Strong Earnings Stretch Market's Rally: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks rose again on Thursday after more companies reported better profits than expected, while yields climbed after a Federal Reserve official cautioned the end to its interest-rate increases may not arrive as soon as Wall Street hoped.
The S&P 500 gained 0.9 percent, adding to its rally from the day before as hopes rise further that the U.S. government can avoid a disastrous default on its debt.
The video-game maker Take-Two Interactive shot to the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after it forecast a huge jump in revenue for the fiscal year following this one. That stoked speculation that Grand Theft Auto VI is on the way, and its stock jumped 11.7 percent.
Bath & Body Works was close behind with a gain of 10.7 percent. It reported stronger revenue and earnings for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
Also helping to support Wall Street was another retailer, Walmart, which rose 1.3 percent after reporting stronger results for the latest quarter than expected. It raised its financial forecast for the full year, though it said it's seeing shoppers remain cautious about spending.
Much scrutiny has been on the retail industry because strong spending by U.S. households has been one of the main pillars keeping the slowing economy out of a recession.
Stocks have remained remarkably resilient since early April despite a long list of worries. A major reason for that is hope the Fed would take it easier on its rate increases, which have slowed inflation at the expense of risking a recession and knocking down prices across financial markets.
The widespread bet was that the Fed would take a pause at its next meeting in June. But Lorie Logan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, cooled some of those hopes in a prepared speech for the Texas Bankers Association.
"The data in coming weeks could yet show that it is appropriate to skip a meeting," she said. "As of today, though, we aren't there yet."
Treasury yields climbed as traders increased bets that the Fed would raise rates again at its June meeting, though the majority are still forecasting a pause.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.64 percent from 3.57 percent late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.25 percent from 4.16 percent.
Higher rates have already slowed swaths of the economy and helped lead to three of the largest U.S. bank failures in history since March. Reports on the economy on Thursday came in mixed.
One showed that fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. While that is good news for workers and for a so-far solid job market, it could also result in upward pressure on inflation. That is what the Fed has been trying desperately to lower by cranking its benchmark interest rate to the highest level since 2007.
A separate report said that manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is continuing to weaken, though not quite as badly as economists expected.
Cisco Systems stock swung between small gains and losses through the day after the company reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected and raised its forecast for the current quarter. Analysts said some investors may be disappointed because of worries about lower-than-expected growth in the following fiscal year. Its stock ended with a gain of 1.2 percent.
The majority of companies in the S&P 500 have reported stronger profits for the first three months of the year than analysts expected. But they are still on track to report a second straight quarter of weaker earnings than a year earlier, according to FactSet.
In stock markets abroad, indexes rose in much of Europe and Asia after Wall Street's rally from Wednesday spread westward. That lift came after President Biden said he was confident about reaching a deal with Republicans to allow the U.S. government to increase its credit limit and borrow more.
An agreement could avert a potential first-ever default on Washington's debt. The government is scheduled to run out of cash to pay its bills as soon as June 1 unless a deal is made, and economists say a U.S. federal default could have catastrophic consequences across financial markets and the economy.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.6 percent to continue a strong recent run, while Germany's DAX in Europe returned 1.3 percent.

Spending On Luxury Up in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The end of pandemic-era restrictions has unleashed a luxury spending rebound in China. Which Western brands are coming out on top?
This time last year, Shanghai -- China's capital of fashion and luxury -- was in the throes of a ruthlessly enforced Covid lockdown. The city's glittering high-end malls and avenues lined with flagship stores stood practically empty.
Today it is a different story. Huge crowds on a recent weekend flocked to top retail destinations on or near Nanjing Road, the hub of glamour in China ever since the country's first large department stores began to open there in 1917.
"I splurge more extravagantly," Sunny Zhang, 24, said as she waited in line to enter the Chanel store at Plaza 66 mall, where the corridors are lined with shops selling some of the world's most expensive apparel. Ms. Zhang, who works for a consulting firm, used to buy six handbags a year. Now, she purchases up to five handbags a month.
"I change my handbag every day," Ms Zhang added. "I felt that everything was meaningless during the Shanghai lockdown, so we should enjoy the present moment in time."
Many Western fashion and luxury brands have been reaping the benefits of this renewed consumer mind-set. Last month, LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group by sales, and the owner of brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Company and Dior, posted a 17 percent increase in first-quarter revenue from a year earlier. Fashion and leather goods -- the French company's biggest division -- were up 18 percent, driven in large part by the rebound in China.
Last week, LVMH shares soared to a record high, making it the first European company to surpass $ 500 billion in market value. Its French rival Hermès said sales in Asia (excluding Japan) were up 23 percent in the first quarter, "driven by a very good Chinese New Year."
And Brunello Cucinelli, purveyor of $ 4,000 blazers and the "quiet luxury" trend, posted a 56 percent surge in first-quarter sales. Luca Lisandroni, the Italian brand's co-chief executive, called 2023 "a golden year" for the China market.
Luxury spending in China is bouncing back even faster than the country's overall economy. Retail sales of jewelry, gold and silver soared 37.4 percent in March from a year earlier, more than three times as fast as the rebound in overall retail sales, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. It was by far the biggest March on record for jewelry sales in China; indeed, March was the industry's second-highest sales month ever outside the gift-giving season before Chinese New Year.
"We expect China to be the luxury industry's key growth engine this year, especially given a slight deceleration in other core markets like the U.S. and Korea," Edouard Aubin, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, said on a call last week.
He added that big brands "at the top of the pricing pyramid" with status-symbol value like Chanel, Hermès and Louis Vuitton were outperforming rivals. Those include Gucci and Burberry, both brands that have recently had a change of designer at their helm.
"Much of the initial spend driving the rebound is, for now, less to do with the middle class of China and more to do with rich people spending more," Mr. Aubin said, noting that he expected a resurgence in middle-class spending to kick in later this year.
This desire for big-name luxury in China isn't new. For more than a decade, the country, with 1.4 billion consumers, powered the Western luxury market, contributing as much as a third of market revenue. Two-thirds of that spending took place outside mainland China, as Chinese tourists flocked to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris and elsewhere to avoid their country's steep import tariffs and consumption taxes.
But then came 2020, the worst year on record for the industry, as China closed its borders in response to the pandemic. Now, after three years of relying largely on online purchases, many shoppers in China exult in being able to touch fabrics, try on handbags and sunglasses and simply share companionship with others.
In the Zhang Yuan neighborhood, where heavily restored buildings have polished wood frames and elegant stone columns, a crowd gathered and waited outside the Dior store to watch for celebrities. The onlookers did not have to wait long: Annie Yi, the famous Taiwanese singer, walked out of the store accompanied by a young woman who carried a white Dior bag big enough to hold a flat-panel television.
Zoe Zhou, who was at the Dior store looking for a handbag owned by a member of the K-pop band Blackpink, said she had seen a frenzy to buy luxury goods in her home city, Nanjing, with people lining up outside of stores at downtown malls.
"Now that restrictions have been lifted, there are a lot of people buying handbags," said Ms. Zhou, who was disappointed that the bag she wanted was sold out. "You can also go abroad. The price difference between domestic and foreign countries is quite large."
Many luxury brands have raised prices in recent months, notably in China. But traveling outside China remains far more difficult than it was before the pandemic.
Airfares are higher, with a significantly reduced overseas flight schedule. As part of a national security campaign, the Chinese government has made it harder to obtain or renew passports.
As domestic destinations like the duty-free tropical island of Hainan continue to gain popularity, and retail hot spots like Chengdu and Hangzhou continue to emerge, the pivot by Chinese shoppers to buying more domestically is expected to continue. Social media posts about stock shortages and long lines have also become common.
"The domestic recovery may be well underway, but international travel is still far from pre-Covid levels, nor do we think Chinese tourists will be returning at the volumes they once did to Europe any time soon," said Thomas Chauvet, head of luxury goods research at Citi. Short-haul destinations like Hong Kong, Macau and possibly Japan, given the weak Japanese yen, may see the return of Chinese spending sooner, he added.
Not everyone has been coming out on top. Muted quarterly results last week from Kering, the home of Gucci and Balenciaga, reminded investors that a rising tide in China won't necessarily lift all brands. The Paris-based group's revenue grew 1 percent in the first three months of 2023, hampered by a slowdown in its U.S. and wholesale business, the dwindling popularity of Gucci and continuing fallout from a controversial advertising campaign published by Balenciaga at the end of last year.
According to Antoine Belge, an analyst at BNP Paribas Exane, "Strong brands with serious brand desirability are getting stronger."
"Being bigger helps," he added.
The same goes for luxury markets. Claudia D'Arpizio, a senior partner at the consultancy Bain, estimated that the population of middle- and high-income consumers in mainland China will double to 500 million by 2030. By then, she predicted, the country will account for around 40 percent of global luxury purchases.
"While African and Southeast Asian countries might be emerging luxury markets," Ms. D'Arpizio said, "the sheer size of the China luxury market makes it unique and of great strategic importance."

Variations on a Theme, And Slight Deviations: [Style Desk]

Full text: The guest list for the first Monday in May, as the Met Gala is also known, serves as a Rorschach test for whom Anna Wintour deems important, circa now. This year's attendees included many of the frequent fliers, like Kim Kardashian, Gigi Hadid and Serena Williams, as well as some new names: the W.N.B.A. star and recent Russian detainee Brittney Griner, the musical artist Doja Cat and -- shockingly -- Paris Hilton. (How is it possible that she's never gone before? A grotesque oversight!)
Each year the dress code tracks to the theme of the show, which this time around is devoted to the six-and-a-half-decade career of Karl Lagerfeld. Many guests wore black and white or suits and gowns embellished with pearls or flowers -- favorite motifs of Mr. Lagerfeld. Bad Bunny went for a full white suit with a stole of fabric flowers that functioned as a train. Janelle Monáe gave a performance on the carpet, removing her enormous Thom Browne coat to reveal a sheer hoop skirt. Doja Cat and Jared Leto each paid homage to Choupette, Mr. Lagerfeld's feline friend. Kylie Jenner, Gabrielle Union, Salma Hayek Pinault and Pedro Pascal stood out in hot reds, and Lil Nas X stole the show in silver body paint and not much else.
There were many wonderful dresses that paid respect to Mr. Lagerfeld's legacy -- in fact, there were too many to name. There were also many looks that just looked great (Halle Bailey, Camila Morrone, Naomi Campbell, Keke Palmer and Aurora James just to name a few). So here's a reminder: The looks that follow did the most at the Met Gala -- not necessarily the best, not necessarily the worst, just the most. For the many more we don't cite here, be sure to look through our red carpet photos.
Michaela Coel: Most Embellished!
"Clutching of the pearls" was one of the driving ideas behind her heavily beaded look from Schiaparelli, Ms. Coel said. And, wow, were there plenty of pearls -- and stones, and crystals, and gold work -- to clutch!
Anok Yai: Most Cumulonimbus!
A rain cloud, but make it glittery. Ms. Yai's gold and silver strapless sequined dress by Prabal Gurung arched out dramatically at her hips, raining down in streams of silver to her feet.
Doja Cat: Most Fancy Feast!
Doja Cat leaned into both her name and the theme, dressing in a homage to Karl Lagerfeld's famed white cat, Choupette. She wore a backless hooded silver gown from Oscar de la Renta with a white feather train. The best part of the look, though, was plastered to her face: custom feline prosthetics.
Bad Bunny: Most Flowers (We Didn't Actually Count)!
Don't step on Bad Bunny's train, but do get on board with it. The musician's white suit from Simon Porte Jacquemus was giving business in the front, party in the back. Or backless, as it were, as the jacket had a large cutout.
Dua Lipa: Most Upholstered!
Like many, the evening's co-chair opted to go straight to the source, wearing a white tweed Chanel gown styled after one model Claudia Schiffer donned in 1992. (Check the pockets!) Bonus points to Ms. Lipa for styling it with some subtle, understated jewelry, a Tiffany diamond necklace weighing in at just 100 carats.
Phoebe Bridgers: Most Skeletal (in a Good Way)!
Fans will have immediately spotted the link between Ms. Bridgers's signature skeleton suit and her Met gown from Tory Burch. On Monday, the musician traded up her usual bones for, fittingly, a black dress studded with strategically positioned pearls.
Taika Waititi: Most Pearlicious!
On a night with no shortage of pearls, Mr. Waititi's strands -- only two slung from his neck and dangling all the way to just below his hips -- fell over a long pearlescent gray tuxedo jacket by Prabal Gurung.
Gisele Bündchen: Most Tom Brady Who?!
Her white Chanel gown was elongated by sparkly columns of paneling, but the most notable part of her ensemble was a white-feathered cape that she flapped for extra drama. Reminiscent of an angel, one might say.
Brian Tyree Henry: Most Royal!
Mr. Henry's look for the evening had other lovely elements -- pearls among them, of course -- but the most important of them was his cape, piled high with artfully structured black ruffles.
Pedro Pascal: Most Internet Daddy!
There are plenty of things one could write about Mr. Pascal's red and black color-blocked pairing on Monday night, but let's be honest, we're all just thinking about the shorts.
Lil Nas X: Most Statuesque!
The musician's entire body -- save for a thong -- was covered in silver paint and rhinestones, like a high fashion Tin Man via Pat McGrath. Someone please snap a photo of his seat after dinner.
Rihanna: Most Wait and See!
Arriving at 10:15 p.m. as only she could and get away with, Rihanna stepped onto the carpet looking rather, well, elliptical tucked inside a cream-colored egg of camellias from Valentino. How was she feeling? "Expensive," she said.
Jared Leto: Most Furry!
Mr. Leto assumed the role of mascot in a giant white cat costume, another nod to Mr. Lagerfeld's beloved pet. After he had sufficiently scared the press corps, he removed the costume, revealing pale blue eye shadow that matched the cat's oversized eyes.
Janelle Monáe: Most True to Form!
What started out as an oversized tweed overcoat ended as a black, sparkly bikini as Ms. Monáe revealed layer after layer -- including a giant hoop skirt -- of Thom Browne. (Which might have taken the prize for least clothes on the carpet were Lil Nas X not in attendance.)
Billie Eilish: Most Bewitching!
The musician's sheer black corset dress from Simone Rocha matched her hair, which was flanked by sparkly black barrettes on either side of her face. A departure from last year's blond bombshell look.
David Byrne: Best Accessory!
The Talking Heads frontman didn't need to worry about his bicycle making it up the steps. Someone came to take it away before he ascended.
The Cockroach: Most 15 Seconds of Fame!
An uninvited guest scurried up the carpet while the crowd waited for Rihanna to make her entrance. "Who are you wearing" jokes were bandied about.

Full text: How best to understand the designer whose 64-year career is the basis for the 2023 Met Gala and Costume Institute exhibition? Just look at the clothes.
Through talent, longevity and sheer productivity, it is possible that Karl Lagerfeld did more than any other designer to shape the look of the latter 20th century and the early 21st century. Across more than six decades, five different brands (three at the same time) and numerous collaborations, he flooded the zone from Paris to Dallas to Shanghai, dressing Hollywood, the haute and the high street.
But why tell when we can show? Here are some of the most notable looks from nearly every stage of an extraordinary career.
Jean Patou
In 1954, Mr. Lagerfeld, a young German with no formal fashion training, won the coat category in the prestigious Woolmark Prize -- a serendipitous event that led to a job as an assistant to the couturier Pierre Balmain, who was one of the judges. After only three years in that atelier, while still in his 20s, Mr. Lagerfeld was named artistic director of Jean Patou, a brand founded in 1914, whose founder was known for liberating the female form and for creating the perfume Joy.
There, Mr. Lagerfeld went on to create 10 couture collections over five years, laying the groundwork for his own facility in working with petites mains, and his ability to romp gleefully within the confines of an established aesthetic.
Chloé
In 1966, Mr. Lagerfeld became designer of Chloé, one of the earliest ready-to-wear brands in Paris, working first with its founder, Gaby Aghion (who initially brought him on as a freelancer in 1964), before becoming sole designer in 1974. He would remain at the brand until 1983, returning again from 1992 to 1997.
Mr. Lagerfeld's early work at Chloé, a name that became synonymous with a certain wafty femininity, may surprise many, toying as it did with prints and Surrealism. But it also reflected his ability to balance luxe eccentricity and wearability, with an eye to commerce (he never saw "sales" as a dirty word). By his second stint, he had fully embraced the bohemian, and set the tone for what was to come.
Fendi
In 1965, the five Fendi sisters, who had inherited their family fur business from their parents, Adele and Edoardo, brought Mr. Lagerfeld on to design their ready-to-wear and fur collections.
They may have thought they were getting a clever designer, but what they actually got was a lifetime partnership. Silvia Venturini Fendi, the daughter of Anna Fendi, who grew up to design Fendi bags and men's wear alongside Mr. Lagerfeld, recalled that even as a child, "when Karl came," it was clear "something special was going on and I should pay attention."
Mr. Lagerfeld created the "FF" logo, which stood for the concept of "fun fur" (as well as Fendi), and then started shaving, dyeing, sculpting and otherwise transforming the material, as well as introducing such pelts as mole, rabbit and squirrel to high fashion.
His work on the runway was equally experimental, with a wide array of references, including Fendi's Roman roots and futurism. When LVMH bought the brand in 1999, Mr. Lagerfeld went with it, eventually pioneering a "haute fourrure" line (who had even heard of that before?) to go with the ready-to-wear, remaining defiantly pro-fur even as the public mood shifted and other brands turned against the idea of wearing animal skins.
Chanel
In 1982, Mr. Lagerfeld got the job that would vault him into the fashion stratosphere: artistic director of Chanel, at that point a brand known primarily for perfume and bourgeois handbags. By adopting an approach he summed up in highly questionable terms ("Chanel is an institution, and you have to treat an institution like a whore -- and then you get something out of her"), he revived a moribund brand, providing a template for the industry that is still in place today.
Splicing classic Chanel iconography -- the camellia, pearls, the Maltese cross, bouclé suiting -- with a heavy dose of irony and irreverence, he managed to make the brand a pop culture phenomenon, a symbol of classicism and a financial juggernaut. He helped create and popularize the traveling fashion show, bringing his runway to Salzburg, Edinburgh, Shanghai and Havana; dreamed up such viral runway sets as an iceberg (sculpted from parts of a Swedish glacier), a supermarket and a rocket ship (that actually lifted off); made mini-movies with Nicole Kidman and Kristen Stewart; and ultimately helped bring the brand annual sales topping $ 11 billion.
Karl Lagerfeld
Perhaps tired of working within the style vernaculars established by others, in 1984, Mr. Lagerfeld founded his own namesake line. While it would never reach the size or fame of Chanel or Fendi, and though it went through numerous ownership changes, Lagerfeld the brand reflected his personal style more closely than any of his other brands. Imagine rock 'n' roll tailoring with a Teutonic edge, filtered through a monochromatic lens, and you'll get the idea.
H&M
In 2004, Mr. Lagerfeld became the first couture designer to collaborate with a mass-market brand when he signed on to do an H&M collection. First the fashion world was shocked, then it was intrigued, and after the line of Karl-alike black suits, portrait tees and L.B.D.s sold out in seconds, a whole new genre and approach was born.

Apple Opens Its First Store Within India: [Correction]

Full text: Tim Cook, the chief executive of the iPhone maker, visited Mumbai to inaugurate the store. Apple is pushing to expand its market share in India, as well as shift some production there.
Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, visited India this week to open the company's first two Apple stores there: The biggest public company in the world is finally opening its first retail outlets in the world's most populous country.
Roaring crowds of would-be customers greeted him in Mumbai on Tuesday at a sleek glass-and-timber flatiron of a storefront, called Apple BKC, in the Bandra Kurla Complex. On Thursday, Mr. Cook will travel to New Delhi to open a second store, Apple Saket, at the center of the capital's biggest mall.
The Apple brand is not new to India. But for the past 25 years -- marked this week, in fact -- Apple has relied solely on third-party sellers to get its products into the hands of Indian consumers. The iPhone is still a rare sight within the ocean of cheaper, and mostly Chinese-branded, Android smartphones that have swept across India over the past decade. Yet in India, as in nearly every other part of the world, Apple has its fans. Some of the most ardent were at the Mumbai opening, screaming their support.
And in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago, was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren't helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself -- and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail.
"I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly -- who does that?" Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. "I don't see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future."
India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India's, has two.
But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India's.
In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company's market share in India has been growing rapidly. The iPhone 13 is the best-selling model in the premium segment, which includes phones that cost above 30,000 rupees, or $ 365. Last year, only 11 percent of the market was considered premium, but it was the fastest-growing segment.
The Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi sold the most phones in total, and the South Korean giant Samsung, which competes at different price points, had the highest value of sales, according to Counterpoint Research.
But Apple faces a consumer-pricing puzzle in India. Unlike a McDonald's, for example, Apple's signature products need to sell for roughly the same price everywhere (or else they would fly around the world, unlocked, on the black market). But the difference between marketing utility goods and luxury products becomes jumbled in the Indian context. In the Saket mall, called Select CityWalk, a bubble of air-conditioning and chromed shopfronts are across the road from a medieval warren; the Apple store is opposite a Krispy Kreme. Outposts of Chanel and Van Heusen are nearby.
Price hits differently in a country where the top 10 percent income bracket begins at 25,000 rupees, or $ 304, per month -- well under half the cost of a new iPhone. For many millions of wealthy Indians, that is perfectly acceptable. And even for those whom it stretches, it can be a price worth paying.
"It's simple: For me, it's a status symbol," said Subodh Sharma, who earns exactly 25,000 rupees per month working for a construction company. "The message that goes out to the peer and society is that, look, this person is not totally third-class," he said, glancing down at the iPhone tucked into his shirt pocket.
Mr. Sharma's partner, Bhawana, however, disagrees with his assessment. An iPhone is "not worth it," she said, right after Mr. Sharma took her photo in front of the store in Delhi. "It's uselessly costly, and its storage is small and battery life even worse." She prefers the Chinese-made Oppo phone she has been using for four years. (She earns 18,000 rupees per month at her job.)
Apple's formidable ecosystem is bound to spread more slowly in a place where the iPhone remains out of reach for so many. Kunal Dua, who runs a pharmaceutical business, recently converted his wife, Gagan Deep Kaur, to the iPhone -- but only halfway. She uses it for her Instagram account and other parts of her online social life, but she stays on her Android for work.
"Most people working under us come from lower-income groups and cannot afford an iPhone," Mr. Dua said. "So sharing media and files becomes difficult."
The relationship between Apple and India is evolving quickly. The part that matters most may have less to do with India's consumers than with the country's growing role as a production hub.
Last week, analysts at JPMorgan Chase published a report describing how a push to move manufacturing and supply chains away from China has been underway "since late 2018, led by geopolitical issues, then a pandemic and now geopolitical issues again rearing their ugly head." They expected a sustained shift and estimated that a quarter of Apple's products will be made outside China by 2025, versus less than 5 percent today, "with Vietnam and India slated as countries of choice."
That migration of high-end manufacturing might activate another ecosystem altogether. Apple is not just any multinational company. A report from Mirae Asset Financial Group said that "given Apple's size, it is a key player that can set standards and influence policy decisions," noting that the company has catalyzed China's growth. "We see a similar trend now occurring in India, as Apple diversifies its supply chain into India and a burgeoning local tech-manufacturing ecosystem develops."
Ultimately, new factories and entire new industries will need to be built before India can generate the kind of wealth necessary for more of its 1.4 billion potential consumers to become regular Apple customers.
During the store opening on Tuesday, Mr. Cook pressed his palms together in a gesture of namaste. Later that day on Twitter, he praised Mumbai for the city's "incredible energy, creativity, and passion."
His fans in India were already delighted to see more of his company in their country. They may now hope that even more multinational executives follow his lead.

Oh, the Leaves on Those Pineapple Lilies: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: And no, it's not because it stinks like rotten meat. (Just for the record, they don't all have a rancid smell.)
The first pineapple lily I grew was a real stinker -- and we have lived happily ever after together for more than 20 years.
Aside from the smell of rotting meat it emitted, Eucomis bicolor made such an impression -- visually, that is -- that I promptly ordered more. In each spring's bulb catalogs, I now search out other pineapple lilies as well, to grow in pots and then stash in my Northeastern cellar for a long winter's nap.
Over the years, I have developed a deep envy of gardeners in warmer places who can grow these Zone 7-ish bulbs, which are hyacinth relatives with origins in Southern Africa, as perennials.
No one stirs that feeling more than Augustus Jenkins Farmer III -- please, just Jenks -- in Beech Island, S.C. Pineapple lilies and other specialty bulbs are mainstays in the garden borders and exuberant, meadow-style designs he creates for clients, as they are at his home farm and in his mail-order nursery.
The signature bulb at Jenks Farmer, Plantsman is the genus Crinum, which is "like Amaryllis on steroids," he said. I have yet to try to convince one to put up with my climate constraints, but I'm tempted. Eucomis, though, Mr. Farmer and I have in common.
Lately, as gardeners with shared obsessions are inclined to do, we have been comparing notes. It turns out that we are both longtime frequent fliers on the Eucomis pages of the excellent Pacific Bulb Society Wiki website.
Each of our conversations has followed a sort of same-plant-different-experience theme. My creativity is confined to seasonal pots, while Mr. Farmer has to contend with the rigors of his Deep South climate, where the summer nights can be nearly as hot as the days, so he is ever seeking plants with appropriate mettle.
No matter our differing situations, what we love about our respective pineapple lilies is unanimous: Oh, those leaves.
"They give you that big, wide kind of tropical foliage effect all season," Mr. Farmer said.
And there are not just a couple of leaves, but enough strappy ones to encircle the emerging flower stem like a lush nest. The leaves can be green or purple, or even freckled with purple, animallike spots, as can the stems.
We love the summertime blooms, too, of course. The many tiny flowers are tightly arrayed around the upper portion of each stem and capped with a tousled topknot of leaflike bracts, making the inflorescence resemble a pineapple. That feature explains the plant's Latin name, Eucomis, from a Greek word for "good-haired."
"The cooler thing: When they go out of flower, they look more or less like they did in flower," Mr. Farmer said. "They maintain their structure and color, so you get a show for a really long time."
Most have no roadkill scent, in case that raises objections. E. bicolor's stench of sulfur compounds is an adaptation that attracts carrion flies as pollinators. Other species, pollinated by specialized wasps, smell perfectly pleasant -- the scent of coconut is sometimes mentioned -- and are marketed as dramatic, long-lasting cut flowers.
Sound good?
The 'Funky Little Flower Farm'
Mr. Farmer has been growing Eucomis for some 30 years, beginning when he was the curator at the Riverbanks Botanical Garden in West Columbia, S.C., and acquired seed from a source in South Africa to evaluate.
Say "Southern African bulb" and gardeners may assume that means the bulb is acclimated to hot, dry conditions. But many Eucomis are actually native to places that get abundant summer rainfall: grasslands, marshy spots, stream banks and seasonally wet areas known as vleis. (That clued me in to provide regular water when they are in active growth, especially in the confines of pots.)
These days, Mr. Farmer conducts on-farm bulb trials that are foundational to all aspects of his business -- garden design, mail-order sales and production growing of bulbs for clients' landscapes. Before he specifies a plant in a design, he needs to know it will perform well.
Although he referred to his farm as "Funky Little Flower Farm" in the title of his charming 2019 self-published memoir, it is a place of exacting horticultural standards.
It's also the family farm where he grew up. After his father died 15 years ago, Mr. Farmer made the decision to return home and save the farm by transforming it into a specialty bulb operation, which he runs today with his husband, Tom Hall.
Don't imagine a farm-like series of parallel nursery rows, though -- or at least not rows you can discern amid the delightful botanical effusion.
"In my garden design, I would say I'm very good at curves, and I'm terrible at straight lines," Mr. Farmer said. "I've resisted straight lines, because when I was little on the farm, my Dad was always like, 'Pull the string and make these straight lines."'
He knows it's the most efficient way to trial large numbers of plants, "but I can't stand to just have a row of one thing," he said. "So I have to interplant, and it just turns itself into a garden. My production beds are not like fields -- they're more like my garden."
Which Ones Work for You?
Our questions go back and forth: How do they do for you in partial shade, or do you grow them all in sun? (We both get away with either setting, but Mr. Farmer points out that full sun maximizes bulb production -- and also that purple-leaved cultivars won't achieve the best color in lower light.)
Do you fertilize them, we ask each other? (A resounding no from both lifelong organic gardeners.)
Mr. Farmer wants to know if I cut them back in midsummer. He does so around July with certain purple-leaved ones that have faded to brownish-green in his brutal summers. And then they send out another flush of fresh stuff, he said -- something I would never have expected a bulb to do.
Have I grown the littlest ones, he wonders, the ones derived from the species E. vandermerwei -- dwarf pineapple lilies that include Octopus and the Tiny Piny series that may reach around six inches high in flower?
And then he makes a small confession: "I don't know if I fail with them because they are not adapted to our climate or because they are tiny, and I tend to lose tiny plants." (In pots here, those little guys are happy, and easier to keep track of. I divide all of my Eucomis every other year and refresh the potting mix.)
More suitable for his designs are bulbs with some stature. Mr. Farmer favors Eucomis pallidiflora subspecies pole-evansii, which has greenish-white flowers that reach three feet high or taller.
The greenish-flowered hybrid Tugela Jade, at about 18 inches high, is another he promotes -- although green flowers are a hard sell. But if you surround them with purple or blue flowers, he noted, you may change your mind.
"Last year, we had it with bachelor button, and that cobalt blue and green were killer together," he said.
Maybe most delicious are Eucomis with purple foliage, a direction that Tony Avent, at Plant Delights Nursery, heralded in 1997 when he introduced Sparkling Burgundy, a cultivar of Eucomis comosa.
Rhode Island Red, introduced by Ed Bowen, of Issima Nursery, is a hybrid of E. comosa and pole-evansii with purple-green foliage and pink flowers. When I grow it, it approaches three feet.
Then there is the fashionable Coco, with dark burgundy leaves and pink flowers.
"Coco must be named for Coco Chanel and her comfortable black outfits," Mr. Farmer writes in his catalog description. "This bulb fits into any little spot. A wild garden, an overly planned color garden, it even works as a potted plant -- that you might brush off and bring inside for a dinner party."
And there is Reuben -- "a bright pinky-fuchsia," he said -- and John Treasure and ...
Uh-oh. You can see where this is leading: more Eucomis.
Making More Eucomis
It's hard to believe the makings of such emphatic beauty are hidden inside the rather unimpressive-looking, squat, flat-bottomed bulbs.
Likewise surprising: More Eucomis bulbs can be had by rooting leaf cuttings taken in midsummer. The process takes about three years to achieve flowering stage, but it's easy, Mr. Farmer said.
Water the plant well the day before, to hydrate the foliage. With a sharp blade, cut a leaf into two-inch cross sections. Dip each lower edge in rooting hormone powder before inserting it a half-inch deep into sand or another sharp-draining medium.
Important: Keep track of which side was down (and up); the cut edge that was pointed away from the bulb won't root.
"In a couple of weeks, you'll know if they're going to rot or root -- ones that aren't working just start to deteriorate," he said.
The successes will send down invisible white roots. Don't expect any top growth. The next year, if you unearth a cutting, you'll see tiny white bulbs the size of lentils with little roots that have formed below the soil line. By the end of that summer, they should be big enough to move into pots, or the garden.
Of course, now I must try this -- and maybe one of the more Northeastern-friendly of Mr. Farmer's diverse collection of Crinum lilies. If only I could limit that bulb experiment to a single kind.

Full text: I have spent the past few decades collecting what I consider to be a stylish wardrobe -- much of which is black. While I love black's versatility, I am starting to feel like I am in a rut, and would like to break out a bit. What can I do to change up my cherished uniform?
Sarah, New York City As someone who has likewise spent a lot of her life wearing black, I understand.
Black is one of those colors that contains within it multitudes. There's the black of Johnny Cash, the Man in Black. The black capris and T-shirt of Audrey Hepburn doing her weird modern dance in "Funny Face," and the long black Givenchy of Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." The shredded, dancing-on-the-moors black of Stevie Nicks, and the black of Macbeth's witches.
There's the black that makes you think of the little black dress, which is always safe and elegant, and the black of the Beats, subversive and rebellious. There's sexy black and somber black and scary black. Also: mysterious black, because which one of the above are you? And: seductive black, because it allows you to choose among so many possible personas. Renoir called it "the queen of all colors." Dior called it "essential to a woman's wardrobe."
But, as with any defining choice, black can start to feel limiting; like a cliché or default, rather than a declaration of self. The problem is, when you have built your identity around one set of associations -- and have invested a fair amount of energy and your budget in it -- how do you expand your horizons without losing the core of your self or upending your wardrobe, neither of which are sustainable or practical?
Slowly. You'd be amazed how much small details make a difference.
Karla Welch, the stylist who works with Tracee Ellis Ross and Sarah Paulson and has a styling app, Wishi, says that a bright red lipstick or colored socks could make a difference. If magenta, the Pantone color of the year for 2023, seems like a step too far, add some T-shirts in basic shades like white. (As Coco Chanel said, "Black has it all. White, too. Their beauty is absolute. It is the perfect harmony.") But try camel, too, or even silver or jewel tones.
TikTok actually has a term for this: sandwich dressing. The idea being to pick a garment in what Ms. Welch calls "an accent color," and then (yes) sandwich it with black. For example, a T-shirt in blue under a black jacket with black pants. Or a beige skirt with a black top and black boots.
The net effect will still be mostly black -- it won't shock everyone who knows you -- but leavened with a bit of contrast. It's like inserting a tiny wedge in a wall that then expands over time to create a much larger space. And maybe a sense of possibility.

Brides Say 'Yes' to Vintage Dresses: [Style Desk]

Full text: With vintage fashion in high demand, the hunt for archival designer wedding dresses is becoming serious business.
One of the most intimate questions you can ask eBay power users is to show you their negotiations -- the private DMs they exchange with sellers bargaining over the price of an item. But Alexis Novak humored me.
The item was a spring 2018 dress from the French luxury brand Céline, then under the creative direction of Phoebe Philo, a designer whose cult following is almost unparalleled in modern fashion. The gown, with long sleeves and a turtleneck and glazed in white sequins, was listed at $ 8,000. Ms. Novak offered $ 6,000. The seller politely declined.
Ms. Novak, 32, didn't push back. She knew her limits. As the founder of Tab Vintage in Los Angeles, she is among the generation of archival fashion collectors helping to change the way celebrities dress. Which means she is experienced in sourcing pieces from auctions, estate sales, resale websites and other dealers -- pieces like the Thierry Mugler dresses worn last year by Kourtney Kardashian Barker to the Oscars, and Dua Lipa to her Ibiza birthday party.
But the Céline dress was different. Ms. Novak didn't intend to add it to her archive for someone else to wear on a red carpet. She collects Ms. Philo's work, and from the moment she had seen the white gown in runway photos in late 2017, she had thought: "That is my dream wedding dress. That is the chicest, coolest dress I've ever seen."
Five years later -- and now engaged to James Valentine, the guitarist for Maroon 5 -- that eBay listing was only the second time Ms. Novak had come across the dress on the resale market. Still, she knew her price, and she walked away.
"But I thought about it every day," she said. "Should I, should I, should I?"
Then, after two months of silence, the eBay seller unexpectedly agreed to Ms. Novak's price. She bought the dress that day.
The truth was that Ms. Novak had long found weddings "kind of cheugy," she said. But since founding Tab in 2019, Ms. Novak, a former comedy writer, had increasingly fielded requests from clients and friends to help them hunt down archival bridal wear -- pieces with "character," she said. "Wearing vintage on your wedding day, you're not just plucking it off a runway or a rack and wearing what someone told you to wear. You're infusing your own personality. It's an extension of you."
She knew of one brick-and-mortar boutique with this kind of inventory (Happy Isles in Los Angeles) but none with a strong online store. "I felt like, from a business standpoint, I was leaving money on the table," she said.
So on Monday, she introduced a collection of about 85 bridal and wedding guest pieces on the Tab Vintage website, furthering a push into the market that began earlier this year.
In January, she was a co-host in Los Angeles of a three-day bridal and evening-wear event with Re-See, a resale company in Paris. All 72 shopping appointments were reserved weeks in advance. "It was madness," Ms. Novak said. A tearful altercation between two brides who wanted the same ruched strapless Loris Azzaro dress reminded Ms. Novak of a sign she once saw outside Amarcord Vintage Fashion in New York: "Nothing haunts you like the vintage you didn't buy."
Then in February, she teamed up with the online luxury retailer Moda Operandi on a selection of wedding dresses, suits and separates, including a 2004 Balenciaga "puffball" gown (reissued from an original 1951 design) and a 2006 Alexander McQueen silk dress with a gold chain bodice. Both sold for around $ 20,000.
That sale "didn't feel so bridal with a capital B," said Jamie Lenore McKillop, a brand consultant who bought a Martin Margiela couture dress from 2006, made from upcycled knits and silk. It was important to Ms. McKillop, 30, who lives in Los Angeles and is getting married in Sea Ranch, Calif., next summer, to find something singular.
"I'm not the girl who is embarrassed if she goes to a party and she sees someone else wearing the same thing," she said. "But with social media, certain weddings and dresses will go viral. And then it really becomes her dress -- or people associate it with someone else -- versus fully your own."
She's still looking for her actual wedding dress, however; the Margiela is for her rehearsal dinner. Because that's the thing about many modern weddings: They aren't just weddings. They are weekends full of welcome parties, after-parties, bridal-brunches-on-the-beach and aprés-ski-farewell lunches.
Chloe Green-Vamos's nuptial wardrobe includes a 1970s ivory Yves Saint Laurent suit ("very Bianca Jagger," she said), which she found in Paris, where the wedding will be held next spring. At the Tab Vintage and Re-See event in January, she bought two Balenciaga minidresses, circa 2000s -- one in textured brocade for the wedding brunch and the other in satin ("kind of Mia Farrow, Sharon Tate, '60s vibe") for the after-party.
She also acquired from Ms. Novak a silk cream column gown from Christian Dior's fall 1999 collection, designed by John Galliano, for her rehearsal dinner. And she is "95 percent sure" that her ceremony dress, currently on hold with Tab, will be a peachy-pink chiffon couture gown, fastened with a velvet black bow and camellia, that Claudia Schiffer wore the first time she walked the runway for Chanel in 1989. It is valued at more than $ 20,000.
Ms. Green-Vamos, 32, who is based in Los Angeles and works in strategy at Estee Lauder, likened her shopping experience to a "fashion Odyssey," in pursuit of pieces she felt would reflect her personality and story. (She studied in Paris and once worked as a buyer for Chanel, for example.) "I wanted that timeless elegance that these designers have been able to retain," she said. "This ability to stay modern, despite everything around us changing."
Ms. Novak herself also wore multiple looks to celebrate her wedding to Mr. Valentine on, yes, Valentine's Day. After the Céline gown, which had been tailored for a tight fit -- its turtleneck was temporarily detached for the occasion -- she changed into a more comfortable red jersey one-shoulder Halston dress from the 1970s. (In searching for her perfect slinky Halston, Ms. Novak acquired at least six; some have made their way into Tab's collection and onto the bodies of celebrities like Madelyn Cline at a Vanity Fair party.) Her veil was an upcycled pink embroidered Dries Van Noten cardigan, found on Vestiaire Collective.
There was also the elopement dress she wore on Feb. 5, when she legally married Mr. Valentine at their home in Los Angeles. The cream gown dated to the 1920s. She had her tailor turn its long sheer sleeves into a halter neckline to make it look "undone but still classic," she said.
Like some of the best vintage pieces, it had no designer label.

Full text: A brain wave reader that can detect lies. Miniaturized cameras that sit inside vape pens and disposable coffee cups. Massive video cameras that zoom in more than a kilometer to capture faces and license plates.
At a police conference in Dubai in March, new technologies for the security forces of the future were up for sale. Far from the eyes of the general public, the event provided a rare look at what tools are now available to law enforcement around the world: better and harder-to-detect surveillance, facial recognition software that automatically tracks individuals across cities and computers to break into phones.
Advances in artificial intelligence, drones and facial recognition have created an increasingly global police surveillance business. Israeli hacking software, American investigation tools and Chinese computer vision algorithms can all be bought and mixed together to make a snooping cocktail of startling effectiveness.
Fueled by a surge of spending from Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates -- the conference's host and an aggressive adopter of next-generation security technologies -- the event pointed to how tools of mass surveillance once believed to be widespread only in China are proliferating. The rising use of the technologies signals an era of policing based as much on software, data and code as on officers and weaponry, raising questions about the effects on people's privacy and how political power is wielded.
"A lot of surveillance could ostensibly be benign or used to improve a city," said Daragh Murray, a senior lecturer of law at Queen Mary University in London who has studied police use of technology. "But the flip side of the coin is it can give you incredible insight into people's everyday lives. That can have an unintended chilling effect or be a tool for actual repression."
The gold rush was evident at a convention center in the heart of downtown Dubai, where uniformed police representatives from around the world browsed drones that could be launched and powered up remotely. Chinese camera makers showed software to identify when crowds gather. American companies like Dell and Cisco had booths offering police services. Cellebrite, an Israeli maker of systems to break into mobile phones, exhibited inside a "government zone" blocked off from the rest of the conference.
Other companies sold facial recognition eyeglasses and sentiment analysis software, in which an algorithm determines a person's mood from facial expressions. Some products, like a Segway with a rifle mount, pushed the limits of practicality.
"Nowadays, the police force, they don't think about the guns or weapons that they're carrying," said Maj. Gen. Khalid Alrazooqi, the Dubai Police's general director of A.I. "You're looking for the tools, the technology."
With its deep pockets, serious security challenges and autocratic government, the Emirates, an important American ally in the Middle East, has become a case study in the potential, and risks, of such policing technologies. The tools can help stop crime and terror attacks but can also become an undemocratic buttress of political power.
Under the leadership of Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, often referred to by his initials, M.B.Z., Emirati authorities have surveilled critics and activists. Amnesty International and other groups have accused the oil-rich country of human rights abuses against adversaries, including using the Pegasus phone spyware made by the NSO Group of Israel. Protests and free expression in the authoritarian monarchy are severely limited, part of what the government has said is an effort to combat Islamic extremism.
One tech firm based in the Emirates with ties to the country's leadership, Presight AI, sells software nearly identical to products that are popular with the Chinese police. At the conference, its software used cameras and A.I. to identify people, store data about their appearance and track their routes as they wandered the event.
A lack of transparency and oversight for the way surveillance technologies are used opens up the potential for abuse, said Marc O. Jones, author of the book "Digital Authoritarianism in the Middle East" and a professor at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar.
"The region has become so securitized, and under M.B.Z., the U.A.E. has become so focused on security there's almost this fetishization of technology," he said.
Cameras are especially prevalent in the two largest emirates, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Dubai, which is flashier and more freewheeling, has cameras tucked away in unassuming corners. In Abu Dhabi, the more conservative center of political power, cameras dominate the cityscape. Grey metal towers that support them shaped like T's and L's hang over roads at predictable intervals.
General Alrazooqi, the Dubai Police's A.I. general director, said in an interview that the cameras were part of a yearslong campaign to become a global leader in police technology -- even though the emirate, which has a population of about 3.5 million, is known for low crime. In recent years, Emirati officials visited police departments and companies in China, Europe and the United States for ideas. The consulting companies KPMG and Gartner were hired to help with the process, the general said. Dubai bought facial recognition systems from Chinese companies including Hikvision and Huawei.
KPMG, Gartner, Huawei and Hikvision declined to comment.
"We pick what is the best practice in each country and to try to perfect and inject it in the system that we have," General Alrazooqi said. He added that the "Chinese are the best" at computer vision and facial recognition.
The Middle East has become a "petri dish of different actors," with China, Russia and the United States vying for influence through their technologies, Mr. Jones said. The heavy presence of Chinese technologies -- most cameras visible on the streets are Chinese -- is a sign of the country's rising influence in the Persian Gulf.
Dubai's police run next-generation systems from a headquarters north of the downtown skyscrapers and malls. One of those systems, a citywide facial recognition program called Oyoon -- Arabic for eyes -- can pull the identity of anyone passing one of at least 10,000 cameras, linking to a database of images from airport customs and residents' identification cards. The police have also required businesses to provide video from their security systems to a centralized government database.
"It's monitoring the whole city from once you enter at the airport to when you leave," General Alrazooqi said. He said the systems served the police's "customers" -- a catchall term for the public. "People, they are happy about it," he said.
The technological abilities were on display in a police command center, where Dubai's officers could view live camera feeds and the locations of all emergency vehicles on a giant screen.
"With technology and smart cameras, if you committed a crime within a minute I will know which direction" someone is going, said Lt. Col. Bilal Al Tayer, acting director of the command and control center.
One advanced tool was predictive policing software built by engineers from Dubai with machine learning that identifies where thieves might strike next. Officials said its 68 percent accuracy rate doubled that of an older model. Inside some patrol cars, mapping software gives officers specific routes to drive based on crime data.
Another algorithm, built on the records of automobile accidents, predicted the roughly 4,000 most dangerous drivers in Dubai, who will receive reminders via text message to drive carefully. The most represented category of bad drivers was older Emirati men, followed by older South Asian men. (Nationality is a factor for the algorithm.)
At the Dubai police fair, officials from the Emirates' Ministry of Interior, which oversees state security and has access to all police cameras, demonstrated how, with a tablet, they could scan the irises of conference attendees and pull up information about when they had entered the country, complete with a recent customs photo. Also displayed was a headset that is said to detect when a part of the brain concerning memories is activated, something a ministry official said was useful during interrogations to determine if a suspect was lying.
Walking among the booths at the conference was Lt. Gen. Abdullah Khalifa Al Marri, the Dubai Police's commander in chief. The new abilities on display, however intrusive, are a means to achieve a long-elusive, utopian goal of "zero crime," he said.
"We don't break the privacy of the people," he added. "We are just monitoring."

When in Doubt, Try Tweaking the Logo: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's a classic move in the fashion playbook when trying to signal a new direction or herald a new designer. But are shifting sensibilities leading more brands to reconsider the humble serif?
Logos carry a peculiar, almost paradoxical burden of both inspiring loyalty and conveying novelty. A good design stands the test of time, while maintaining the allure of the new; too new, and it risks a sense of betrayal.
Consider the City of New York's recently announced, and widely panned, "We ❤️ NYC" logo, an update of "I ❤️ NY," the beloved Milton Glaser design created in 1976. High-profile logo redesigns often incite emotional uproars -- and increasingly, public discussions of the fashion of fonts.
When the British luxury brand Burberry introduced a new logo of its own last month, it seemed everyone in the fashion circuit had a hot take on typography trends.
Burberry joined two recently debuted serif logos from Ferragamo and Phoebe Philo, leading online followers to proclaim the era of serif typefaces in, and the era of "blanding" sans-serifs decidedly out.
For the uninitiated, serifs refer to the short marks, or "feet," at the ends of a letter's strokes (as seen in certain typefaces, such as the one used by The New York Times). A typeface that includes serifs is referred to as a serif, and one that does not, a sans-serif.
But for branding experts and design industry players whose daily work involves the detailed craft of custom typography and lettering, the hubbub was more a source of mild amusement.
"No one's really having the conversation about whether the logos are actually well drawn or not," said Grace Robinson-Leo, a founder and creative director at Decade, a branding studio that has consulted for Khaite, Banana Republic and Playboy.
According to Ellen Lupton, a design author and educator, the perceived binary of serif versus sans-serif is "really quite artificial" anyway. She noted that it "doesn't exist in most other writing systems that are not Latin based."
Michaël Amzalag, a founder of the art and design studio M/M Paris, described the fashion world's preoccupation between serifs and sans-serifs as "a dichotomy established decades ago, since the 1940s," pointing to the age-old rivals Chanel and Dior. His studio's brand identity for the Spanish luxury house Loewe has stayed in use for a decade -- a lifetime in internet years -- and notably bucks fashion industry trends by pairing two contrasting styles: a stately serif along with an ornate, script-style letter L.
Broadly speaking, serifs evoke "a certain historicism," said Michael Rock, a partner at the design consultancy 2x4, whose clients include Prada and Shanghai Tang. Serifs, as all typefaces, have always carried with them "the mark of a tool," he said.
Originating in the Latin alphabet, serifs date back to Roman antiquity, when inscribers would first sketch then carve letters into stone, Mr. Rock said. As a matter of function, the serifs were added as a so-called stop cut to prevent the longer strokes of letters from chipping out, he explained.
These classical forms have persisted as formal references in type design, even as technology progressed well beyond the days of chisel and stone. Sans-serifs emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the industrial age and Modernist ideology inspired type designers to remove extraneous, ornamental vestiges of the past. Form follows function, as the adage goes, and serifs were thought to no longer serve a purpose.
"Now, we're in an age where everything is produced by digital means, and that difference between modernity and classicism is less ideological and more stylistic," Mr. Rock said. Still, the associations remain.
In the new serif logos of Ferragamo and Burberry, that subtle play for historicism may be key to winning back customer bases in an increasingly competitive landscape of newer brands. But at Daniel Lee's first show as Burberry's new designer, the new typeface -- an about-face from the brand's previous logo, a streamlined treatment created by Peter Saville less than five years ago -- took a back seat to the revival of the brand's turn-of-the-century equestrian knight design, a sort of heraldry that featured in a royal blue.
As abstracted, abbreviated signifiers, logos are but the tip of the iceberg for a large body of world-building creative work that forms a brand image, though they often attract outsize influence -- an influence that luxury fashion brands have in recent years used to steer controversy and buzz around an incoming creative director.
"Letter forms are the smallest containers for meaning," said Mathias Augustyniak, Mr. Amzalag's partner at M/M Paris, with typography offering the potential for a second layer of authorship. But the more common trend for publicity-driven redesigns, he suggested, are "more about creating noise than a true design act."
Fans of Ms. Philo, who led Celine from 2008 to 2018, still refer to Peter Miles's design of the "old Celine" logo -- which the brand's current creative director, Hedi Slimane, famously altered upon taking the reins, removing the accent over the E, among other adjustments recalling elements of the brand's 1960s logo. (Mr. Miles, who also created the mark for Ms. Philo's coming namesake brand, said of the serif-versus-sans-serif question: "Both have a place, both permanently current.")
Mr. Slimane also courted controversy during his tenure at Saint Laurent, where he dropped the Yves and replaced the previous word mark, created in 1961 by the French painter and typographer Cassandre, with a bold, all-caps sans-serif.
That, too, was an archival reference -- this time, to the original logo for the brand's ready-to-wear collection, Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, started in 1966. (The brand has since quietly reverted to a logo set in Cassandre's typeface, still absent the Yves, to form a mash-up that Mr. Amzalag referred to as "an amputation" akin to "cutting an arm off of Mona Lisa.")
In 2017, Mr. Saville, who established his career designing album artwork for Factory Records in the 1980s and is now a fashion-industry favorite for logo redesigns (including the latest one for Ferragamo), updated the Calvin Klein logo when Raf Simons took the helm.
Copycats exist throughout fashion, as a popular meme shows, listing examples of luxury brands -- Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Burberry, Berluti, Balmain -- whose logos had gone sans-serif within the past five to six years.
Starting a new label with a blank slate, however, the new Phoebe Philo logo designed by Mr. Miles, set in all-caps Times New Roman -- the familiar, default typeface of Microsoft Office -- breaks from the pack with a sort of rebellious indifference.
Mr. Rock described it as "a typographic version of a studied blankness, what in Italian might be called sprezzatura" -- a knowing and cool nonchalance belying a precise eye.
"Make no doubt about it, though," he said. "This takes enormous effort to achieve."
Ms. Robinson-Leo expressed an appreciation for the aesthetic created by Ms. Philo and Mr. Miles, though she said she could not quite put her finger on what exactly she admired about it. "When a logo is really beautiful and really well drawn, it really stands the test of time, and it often sets the tone for a kind of style or aesthetic that other people get excited about," she said.
The online hive has quieted its parsing of Burberry's new face, and it's too soon to know how it will fare over time. It's also possible that nobody will notice or remember.
"In the same way that social media is so immediate," Mr. Rock said, "it also has really short memories."

Hidden Technology Put the Wrong Person in Jail: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Because of a bad facial recognition match and other hidden technology, Randal Reid spent nearly a week in jail, falsely accused of stealing purses in a state he said he had never even visited.
On the Friday afternoon after Thanksgiving, Randal Quran Reid was driving his white Jeep to his mother's home outside Atlanta when he was pulled over on a busy highway. A police officer approached his vehicle and asked for his driver's license. Mr. Reid had left it at home, but he volunteered his name. After asking Mr. Reid if he had any weapons, the officer told him to step out of the Jeep and handcuffed him with the help of two other officers who had arrived.
"What did I do?" Mr. Reid asked. The officer said he had two theft warrants out of Baton Rouge and Jefferson Parish, a district on the outskirts of New Orleans. Mr. Reid was confused; he said he had never been to Louisiana.
Mr. Reid, a transportation analyst, was booked at the DeKalb County jail, to await extradition from Georgia to Louisiana. It took days to find out exactly what he was accused of: using stolen credit cards to buy designer purses.
"I'm locked up for something I have no clue about," Mr. Reid, 29, said.
His parents made phone calls, hired lawyers and spent thousands of dollars to figure out why the police thought he was responsible for the crime, eventually discovering it was because Mr. Reid bore a resemblance to a suspect who had been recorded by a surveillance camera. The case eventually fell apart and the warrants were recalled, but only after Mr. Reid spent six days in jail and missed a week of work.
Mr. Reid's wrongful arrest appears to be the result of a cascade of technologies -- beginning with a bad facial recognition match -- that are intended to make policing more effective and efficient but can also make it far too easy to apprehend the wrong person for a crime. None of the technologies are mentioned in official documents, and Mr. Reid was not told exactly why he had been arrested, a typical but troubling practice, according to legal experts and public defenders.
"In a democratic society, we should know what tools are being used to police us," said Jennifer Granick, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.
A Contract With Clearview AI
In a panic, Mr. Reid's family immediately retained an Atlanta lawyer from the Cochran Firm. He could not get Mr. Reid out of jail, and he struggled to gather more information. He suggested that the family members hire someone in Louisiana, so they cold-called law firms in Jefferson Parish and Baton Rouge until they found Thomas Calogero, a criminal defense lawyer. They retained him that Sunday.
Mr. Calogero found out that Mr. Reid was accused of the summer thefts of two Chanel purses and a brown Louis Vuitton bag, collectively worth almost $ 13,000, from Second Act, a consignment store on the outskirts of New Orleans. Mr. Calogero went to the store and talked to the owner, who showed him a still from a surveillance camera. He realized that one of the alleged fraudsters looked like Mr. Reid, but the man was heavier.
"The guy had big arms, and my client doesn't," Mr. Calogero said. A Jefferson Parish sheriff's officer insisted it was a "positive match," language that made Mr. Calogero believe that facial recognition technology had been used, and he spoke to the New Orleans news outlet NOLA.com about what he believed had happened.
A person with direct knowledge of the investigation confirmed to The New York Times that facial recognition technology had been used to identify Mr. Reid. Yet none of the documents used to arrest him disclosed that.
Andrew Bartholomew, the Jefferson Parish financial crimes detective who sought the warrant to arrest Mr. Reid, wrote in an affidavit only that he had been "advised by a credible source" that the "heavyset black male" was Mr. Reid. Reached by phone, Detective Bartholomew declined to comment.
"It's untenable to me as a matter of basic criminal procedure that people who are subject to arrest are not informed of what got them there," said Barry Friedman, a constitutional law professor at New York University.
The Sheriff's Office has a contract with one facial recognition vendor: Clearview AI, which it pays $ 25,000 a year. According to documents obtained by The Times in a public records request, the department first signed a contract with Clearview in 2019.
Clearview scraped billions of photos from the public web, including social media sites, to create a face-based search engine now used by law enforcement agencies. Mr. Reid has many public photos on the web linked to his name, including on LinkedIn and Facebook. The public information office for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office did not respond to requests for comment about the use of Clearview AI.
The company's chief executive, Hoan Ton-That, said an arrest should not be based on a facial recognition search alone.
"Even if Clearview AI came up with the initial result, that is the beginning of the investigation by law enforcement to determine, based on other factors, whether the correct person has been identified," he said. "More than one million searches have been conducted using Clearview AI. One false arrest is one too many, and we have tremendous empathy for the person who was wrongfully accused."
Detective Bartholomew's identification of Mr. Reid led to a second warrant for his arrest in East Baton Rouge Parish, where, according to a police report, the man he resembled had used a stolen credit card to buy a $ 2,800 Chanel bag at another consignment store.
The Baton Rouge Police Department "trusted the information" from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office, a department spokesman, Sgt. L'Jean McKneely, said. "What methods they used, we do not know," he added.
Law enforcement officers generally say they do not need to mention the use of facial recognition technology because it is only a lead in a case and not the sole reason for someone's arrest, protecting it from exposure as if it were a confidential informant. But according to Clare Garvie, an expert on the police use of facial recognition, there are four other publicly known cases of wrongful arrests that appear to have involved little investigation beyond a face match, all involving Black men. She has come across a handful of other examples across the country, she said, in her work with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
For Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, a racial justice advocacy group, the technology exacerbates the problems of what he called "racist policing."
"If facial recognition was misclassifying white people, white men or white women, it would not be on the shelf," he said. "Some of us and some of our communities are expendable."
'Rubber-Stamping Warrants'
To get a warrant to arrest someone, an officer must convince a judge there is probable cause -- meaning, essentially, there is a good reason to do so -- and get the judge's signature. In the past, that meant an officer had to go to court, or even meet a judge at a diner in the middle of the night if the case was urgent. That is a moment when questions are asked about the strength of the evidence, legal experts say.
But the friction of getting a warrant has been eased by technology. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office uses an "eWarrant" service, CloudGavel, for which it paid $ 39,800 last year. It's an app that allows officers to request digital signatures from judges. "Law enforcement officers can now get an arrest warrant approved in minutes," the company's website states.
Many civil liberties advocates actually favor electronic warrants; they allow judges to more easily review decisions made by the police and eliminate a complaint from officers that it's too hard to get a warrant. But advocates said it would be worrisome if judges were simply clicking a button without asking questions or providing sufficient scrutiny.
"There are real questions about whether it increases the incidence of judges rubber-stamping warrants," said Nathan Freed Wessler, a deputy director with the A.C.L.U.'s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project.
A criminal court judge signed off on Mr. Reid's arrest warrant at 4:28 p.m. on July 18. CloudGavel "accommodates" judicial scrutiny, said Casey Roussel, the president and chief operating officer of CloudGavel's parent company, FusionStak, in an email. He said judges could "connect with the officer via phone or video to discuss any concerns the judge may have about the warrant."
In Mr. Reid's case, it is unclear if the detective spoke with the judge or explained the nature of the "credible source." The judge declined to comment.
A 'Random Query'
"I was driving the normal speed, and I wasn't doing anything crazy," Mr. Reid said of the day of his arrest.
Body camera footage obtained by The Times reveals that four police vehicles were involved in pulling him over. The two warrants for his arrest asked for "full extradition." To the law enforcement officers in Georgia, Mr. Reid would have appeared to be a fugitive from Louisiana justice.
Why exactly Mr. Reid and his white Jeep attracted the DeKalb County police's attention that day is unclear. The arresting officer wrote in an incident report that he had learned about Mr. Reid's warrants from a "random GCIC/NCIC query of the vehicle tag," referring to the National Crime Information Center, an F.B.I. repository of wanted persons and vehicles, and the Georgia Crime Information Center. It's possible the officer saw Mr. Reid driving by and, for some reason, decided to run his license plate.
But Molly Kleinman, the director of a technology policy research center at the University of Michigan, said many kinds of surveillance technologies on the highway could have alerted the officer to Mr. Reid's presence on the "hot list," including toll pass readers and automated license plate readers, which Atlanta has in the hundreds on roads and police vehicles. (A spokesman for the DeKalb County police said a license plate reader was not used.)
"There's a lot of secrecy about all of these surveillance technologies and the ways that they're used," Ms. Kleinman said. "This case is a perfect example that even when the tool works as intended, if the underlying data is flawed it can still harm innocent people."
Not Involved
Mr. Reid sat in DeKalb County jail for nearly a week. He could not be released on bond because he was supposed to be held until Louisiana officers came to pick him up for prosecution in their state. His Jeep was towed and impounded.
"Imagine you're living your life and somewhere far away says you committed a crime," Mr. Reid said. "And you know you've never been there."
His lawyer, Mr. Calogero, gathered photos and videos of Mr. Reid from his family, hoping to more clearly show the Louisiana police what Mr. Reid looks like, and sent them to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office on Wednesday, Nov. 30, five days after the arrest. An hour later, Mr. Calogero said, an officer called to inform him that the police were withdrawing the warrant because they had noticed a mole on Mr. Reid's face that the alleged purse thief did not have.
Mr. Reid's detainment was "unfortunate by all means," Sheriff Joseph P. Lopinto III of Jefferson Parish said. "As soon as we realized it wasn't him, we moved mountains in order to get him out of jail."
A Jefferson Parish judge recalled the warrant on Wednesday afternoon. "After further investigation, it was learned Randal Reid was not involved in the crimes committed," the recall said. Mr. Reid was released late Thursday night, almost a full week after being pulled over. He is considering filing a wrongful-arrest lawsuit.
"Thousands of dollars for something I didn't do," he said.
Mr. Robinson, the Color of Change president, said most people in the United States did not have thousands of dollars to clear their names. These people will have "names and stories we will never know," he said. "They will languish in jails and prisons."

Ivan Bart Changed the Notion of What's Beautiful: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ivan Bart, who helped kick-start the careers of some of today's most recognizable models, has left his role as president of the agency IMG Models.
On the April cover of British Vogue, three models wearing dresses that hug their hourglass figures are described by three words: "The New Supers."
Those models -- Jill Kortleve, Precious Lee and Paloma Elsesser -- are represented by IMG Models, an agency that also represents Gigi and Bella Hadid. The models on the cover of British Vogue, all of whose careers may have once been hindered because they are not size zero, represent the agency's efforts to redefine who a supermodel can be.
Ivan Bart, 59, the president of IMG Models, has been an important part of those efforts. On Friday, he left that position for a role as senior adviser at the agency, according to a news release sent by its parent company, Endeavor.
"Ivan has quite literally changed the shape and face of the modeling industry," Mark Shapiro, the president of Endeavor, wrote in a statement to The New York Times. "We are honored that we will still continue to benefit from his vision in this next chapter."
Mr. Bart, who has worked at IMG Models for three decades, will not be replaced by another president. His departure is part of a series of organizational changes at Endeavor, which last year hired Susan Plagemann, a former chief business officer at Condé Nast, to run a newly formed division called WME Fashion. IMG Models, now part of that division, will be led by Jeni Rose and Kate Stirling.
Mr. Bart said that as part of his new role, he will continue to identify new models. "I want to keep finding great talent," he said.
More models these days can be short or curvy or middle-aged, and they can emerge from social media or reality television. Scouting talent has always been a part of the business, but when Mr. Bart came to IMG from Ford Models as an agent, in 1994, the industry was less inclusive.
In his early years at the agency, Mr. Bart worked with some of the most sought-after models at the time, including Carolyn Murphy and Stephanie Seymour. Though Mr. Bart was young, he was "a big thinker," Ms. Seymour said. "He had ambition for the girls."
"He was also incredibly personable," she added. "Someone you could trust, someone you could ask their opinion or tell a secret to."
Kyle Hagler, who worked at IMG Models from 1996 to 2014, said that Mr. Bart also took an interest in progressive causes within the industry. Mr. Hagler recalled how Mr. Bart attended a 2007 news conference hosted by Bethann Hardison, a former model and an agent, to call attention to the lack of racial diversity on runways and in advertising.
Ms. Hardison, who has also worked as a casting director, described Mr. Bart as "someone who always cared about the issues that I cared about."
In 2009, Chuck Bennett, then the president of IMG Models, left the agency. Mr. Bart was named its director, essentially replacing Mr. Bennett.
The model Martha Hunt, who had mostly posed for catalogs when she was introduced to Mr. Bart in 2012, said that meeting with him changed everything for her. "I went from doing catalog work to, overnight, walking for Prada and Chanel," Ms. Hunt said.
When IMG Models signed Gigi Hadid, in 2012, she was arguably best known for appearing on TV alongside her mother, who was then a star of "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills." Mr. Bart made some of her early introductions to fashion world players, including the editor Carine Roitfeld, whose magazine CR Fashion Book featured Gigi Hadid in 2014.
Mr. Bart was named president of IMG Models in 2014, after the agency was acquired by the entertainment conglomerate that owns WME. That year, after the closure of the plus-size division at Ford Models, IMG signed Ashley Graham and other plus-size models who had been dropped by Ford.
In 2017, Ms. Graham became the first plus-size model to appear on the covers of British Vogue and American Vogue. In 2018, she became a face of Revlon.
"Being the president of an agency that sells beauty is a tricky thing in these times, when beauty is loaded with political meaning and values," said Linda Wells, a former editor in chief of Allure, who was the chief creative officer at Revlon when the brand signed the deal with Ms. Graham. "It requires a different vision and awareness. Ivan really pushed that, and pushed that in a forceful way."
Mr. Bart further expanded the notion of who can be a model by supporting the careers of transgender models such as Hari Nef, who signed with IMG in 2015, and of Maye Musk, the mother of Elon Musk, who was 68 when she signed with the agency in 2016. Mr. Bart also gave his stamp of approval to Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of Vice President Kamala Harris, who signed with the agency a week after she attended President Biden's inauguration in 2021.

Energetically Taking On the Episodic Musical: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Developed by a team of Broadway and Hollywood all-stars, the new Hulu series sets a chorus of inner critics to song.
The rats were not on the call sheet. They turned up anyway.
For the members of the brain trust behind the new Hulu musical series "Up Here," this balmy September night last year was to be a precious occasion: After more than two years of cross-country video calls, the writer and executive producer Danielle Sanchez-Witzel had flown in from Los Angeles during the last full week of production, finally giving her a chance to hang out on set with her collaborators -- a gang of Broadway powerhouses that included the highly decorated songwriting couple behind "Frozen," Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez.
"She was one of our best friends in the pandemic," Anderson-Lopez said at the time, at an outdoor shoot in the Manhattan neighborhood of Hudson Heights. "We spent six to eight hours together a day during 2021. And we just hugged in person for the first time 10 minutes ago."
And then Sanchez-Witzel got a dose of New York City realness. As they gathered around the monitors, with the cameras rolling just a few yards away, a few enterprising rodents decided to join the fun. Snacks were stashed. Sanchez-Witzel nervously pulled up her feet. Someone joked about creating a viral video to promote the show.
It was just the latest twist in the bigger challenge faced by the illustrious team behind "Up Here," which dropped all eight episodes of its first season on Friday: how to merge that most classically New York of art forms, the stage musical, with a much younger Hollywood one -- the bingeable half-hour streaming sitcom.
Stage musicals have been adapted into movies for decades; live television adaptations have made a comeback in recent years, too. But turning one into serialized television is new. This alone would make "Up Here," developed from an original musical by the Lopezes, stand out.
Add to that the Tony-winning creative powers of the writer Steven Levenson ("Dear Evan Hansen") and the director Thomas Kail ("Hamilton"), and the series also comes courtesy of Broadway's equivalent to a Marvel superteam.
"I think they wanted to make sure someone hadn't won a Tony in this group," Sanchez-Witzel said. (She, Levenson and the Lopezes are all credited as developers.) She joked that over the years she had spent "thousands of dollars on StubHub" to watch her new collaborators' shows.
Given the surrealistic premise of "Up Here," it was perhaps always well suited for the screen -- think "Herman's Head" with music, or "Inside Out" with nagging parents, mean ex-crushes and former friends instead of lovable little gremlins. Set at the turn of the millennium, it centers on Lindsay and Miguel (played in the series by Mae Whitman and Carlos Valdes), a young couple who meet outside a bar bathroom where Lindsay's roommate is having sex with a stranger.
If a show about the lurid dating lives of 20-something New Yorkers feels a little familiar, the twist is that the characters' thoughts, as personified by people from their lives, constantly speak up -- or, rather, sing up -- to interfere.
The original musical premiered in San Diego in 2015, then was shelved while the Lopezes worked on other things. It didn't stay on the shelf for long. Early in 2020, Kail, who since directing "Hamilton" had begun to develop a solid reputation in television (he was an executive producer and director of the acclaimed FX series "Fosse/Verdon"), was looking for a new project he could sink his teeth into. He knew the Lopezes from the theater world -- in addition to their songs for the "Frozen" movies and "Coco," Lopez had co-written "Avenue Q" and "The Book of Mormon" -- and he asked if they had anything lying around.
They were keen to take another crack at "Up Here." Kail saw potential. He soon pulled in Levenson, his fellow developer of "Fosse/Verdon." All agreed that "Up Here" would work best as a comedy series. There was just one problem.
"We quickly decided none of us had any experience in half-hour television," Levenson said. So Kail contacted Sanchez-Witzel, whose credits included "The Carmichael Show" and "New Girl." She signed on but continued to work from Los Angeles. (Kail, the Lopezes and Levenson are also executive producers.)
The team's central task was figuring out how to translate the stage version to episodic television. The idea, as Levenson explained it, was to create a musical that spanned eight episodes but where each was also its own mini-musical. And the tunes had to be more than an accessory.
"The show needed to function like a musical, where the songs actually were necessary to the storytelling, so that if you removed them, the show wouldn't work," Levenson said.
The learning curve was steep for both sides.
"Danielle told us about certain structures of a 30-minute comedy," Anderson-Lopez said. "And we talked a lot about how when we're looking for songs in theater or animated musicals, we're always looking for a moment when a character is having a feeling so big, they can't speak anymore. It was really fun figuring out those spaces in a half-hour comedy."
Eventually, the set list from the San Diego production was almost entirely put aside. The male lead's name was also changed from Dan to Miguel.
"I felt strongly that this time around he should be not white," said Lopez, the youngest person ever to win an EGOT -- an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony -- and also the only person to have won each award more than once. He and Sanchez-Witzel share "a similar experience being nonwhite and feeling disconnected from both the white mainstream and from our immigrant histories," he added. (Lopez is of Philippine descent; Sanchez-Witzel is Mexican American.) "We thought that'd be interesting to put into this character."
To find their lead actors, the New York-based creators followed a procedure they were all familiar with. This was an advantage for Valdes.
"I got there, and with the accompanist and the music, I was like, 'Oh, this is like a theater audition,"' said Valdes, who is best known for playing Cisco/Vibe on the CW's "The Flash" but has extensive show-tune experience, including appearing in the Broadway hit "Once" a decade ago.
"It had been a long time since I'd been in that kind of musical theater space, but it felt so familiar," he said, "like a homecoming."
Landing the part was more fraught for Whitman, whose extensive television résumé ("Parenthood," "Arrested Development") had not prepared her for an old-school tryout. "I had to fly to New York and stand in front of a table full of people next to a piano player and have to sing," Whitman said in a joint video call with Valdes. "It was terrifying. I can sing, but I'd never done anything like that."
As for the actors handling Lindsay and Miguel's inner voices, they tend to straddle both worlds. Portraying Lindsay's parents are the writer, humorist and actor John Hodgman and the Broadway and "Brockmire" veteran Katie Finneran. Team Miguel includes Scott Porter, an original cast member of the Off Broadway hit musical "Altar Boyz" who went on to star in "Friday Night Lights." That evening in Hudson Heights, he was rocking a goatee and suspenders that made him look like a cocky late-90s corporate bro, which is exactly what he plays.
From his experience in theater and on "Fosse/Verdon," Kail had learned that things went smoother if you had everyone in the same building; aside from the portions shot on location, the entire production was concentrated at a compound in Long Island City, Queens, from the writing to the choreography to the costume making.
"The thing with theater is, there is a moment when you move into the theater and everybody's under the same tent," he said. "We wanted to try to do that here and bring everybody in."
Except, of course, for Sanchez-Witzel, who until the final full week had to make do from Los Angeles. It was great that technology had allowed her to observe the set from 3,000 miles away, she said, but she couldn't deny the thrill of finally watching it all in person: the strips of ratty off-white carpet evoking dirty Manhattan snow, the whispers between takes, the in-person chemistry between Whitman and Valdes.
Then there was the massive boulder in the middle of a block in Hudson Heights, where Lindsay and Miguel share an important kiss.
"To see the rock in person -- it's probably hard for you to imagine how exciting it is," Sanchez-Witzel said, laughing. "But to me, it's extremely exciting!"

We Need to Talk. But First I'll Consult a Chat Bot.: [Style Desk]

Full text: Faced with challenging situations in parenting, romance or work, some are getting by with a little help from their A.I. friends.
Todd Mitchem kept struggling to have honest, productive conversations with his son. "He's 15," Mr. Mitchem, 52, said with a laugh. "Teenagers are so difficult to connect with."
Every time he tried to bring up a sensitive issue, his son would give vague answers or run away, preferring to avoid serious talks altogether.
In the past when Mr. Mitchem needed parenting help, he would read a book or pose a question to the men's support group he meets with weekly.
But recently he has turned to ChatGPT. And he's not alone: Others are turning to artificial intelligence chat bots to figure out what to say in situations that feel high-stakes. They are using the tool to talk or read to their children, to approach bosses, to provide difficult feedback, to write wedding vows or to pen love letters.
Unlike turning to friends or even professionals for help, the bot, said Mr. Mitchem, gives what feels like objective advice. "The bot is giving me responses based on analysis and data, not human emotions," he said.
ChatGPT, the new virtual tool powered by Open AI, sources its information from a wide range of online material including books, news articles, scientific journals, websites and even message boards, allowing users to have humanlike conversions with a chat bot.
"It's giving you what the collective hive mind on the internet would say," said Irina Raicu, who directs the internet ethics program at Santa Clara University. (Other companies including Google and Microsoft have their own versions of this technology, and Microsoft's, called Bing A.I., was recently made famous for aggressively declaring its love to the New York Times journalist Kevin Roose.)
Mr. Mitchem, who lives in Denver and is the executive vice president of learning and product for a leadership training company, opened his conversation by typing, in summary: "I need some friendly advice."
"OK, no problem," ChatGPT responded, according to Mr. Mitchem. "What is your name?"
In the course of their conversation, ChatGPT told Mr. Mitchem that he is a good father for even wondering how to approach a conversation with his son about the decision to join a basketball team. "It said something like, 'It's cool if you don't get it right, but it's awesome that you are trying."
Mr. Mitchem said the bot then continued: "Teenage boys, when they are growing up, are trying to force their independence. Remember when you talk to him, he needs to know that you trust your decisions."
The next day Mr. Mitchem approached his son and tried out the advice. "I said to him, 'You need to make this decision, you are 14, and I trust you will make a good one," Mr. Mitchem said. "My son goes, 'Wow, that's awesome. I'll let you know what I decide."'
"We left on a positive note," Mr. Mitchem said. "It totally worked." Once Upon a Time ...
For Naif Alanazi, a 35-year-old Ph.D. student at Kent State University, bedtime is a sacred ritual for him and his 4-year-old daughter, Yasmeen. "I have to work all day," he said. "This is our special time."
His Saudi Arabian family has a deep tradition of telling oral stories. Wanting to continue it, he used to try to concoct new, thrilling tales each evening. "Do you know how difficult it is to come up with something new every day?" he asked, laughing.
Now, however, he lets the bot do the work.
Every night he asks ChatGPT to create a story that involves people (his daughter's teacher, for instance) and places (school, the park) from her day, along with a cliffhanger at the end so he continue the story the next night. "Sometimes I ask it to add a value she needs to learn like honesty or being kind to others," he said.
"Being able to give her something that is more than a generic story, something that can increase our bond and show her that I am interested in her daily life," he said, "it makes me feel so much closer to her."
Love Languages
Anifa Musengimana, 25, who is in graduate school for international marketing in London, is certain that chat bots can help make the tedium of online dating more interesting. "I am having a lot of repetitive conversations on these apps," she said. "The app can give me fun ideas of what to talk about, and maybe I'll find better people to date."
"If I get intriguing answers, I will be drawn in," she said.
She said she would tell her match she was using the tool. "I would want a guy who finds it funny," she said. "I wouldn't want a guy who is so serious that he gets mad at me for doing it."
Some are using chat bots to enhance the relationships they already have.
James Gregson, 40, a creative director who lives in Avon, Conn., has been using ChatGPT to draft love letters to his wife.
"I am not a poet, I am not a songwriter, but I can take topics on things my wife might like and put it into a song or poem," he said.
He also believes in full disclosure: "I am going to give her one, but I am going to tell her who wrote it," he said. "I am not trying to con her." Office Applications
Jessica Massey, 29, a finance analyst at Cisco Systems, who lives in Buffalo, has been writing draft emails to her boss using ChatGPT. "I wanted to test out its capabilities to see if there was a different way A.I. would word what I was thinking in my head," she wrote in an email. (One person interviewed confessed to consulting ChatGPT to help prepare for their interview for this story. Another admitted to using it for employee reviews.)
Ms. Massey used the bot to write an email to her boss explaining why the company should pay for a certain professional certification. The bot gave her pretty boilerplate language, she said. She hasn't sent it yet, but plans to once she changes "the verbiage a bit to make it sound more like me."
Ms. Massey, however, has a rule about relying on a chat bot: "Disclose it at the end of your work or not use it at all."
However, scholars who study technology and ethics have mixed feelings about using ChatGPT for highly personal communication.
"We shouldn't automatically reject tools that might help people deal with a difficult conversation," said Michael Zimmer, the director of the Center for Data, Ethics and Society at Marquette University. He equates it to buying a Hallmark Card for a birthday or anniversary. "We've all accepted doing that because the words on the card align with something I believe," he said. However, Ms. Raicu, from Santa Clara University, worries about people using ChatGPT for personal communication. She doesn't like the idea that there is a "right" and "wrong" way to communicate. "I think the right words depend on who the people are who are communicating and the context," she said. "There is no formula for a lot of this stuff."
Ms. Raicu said that using ChatGPT for personal communication may undermine trust: "People might ask, 'Do I really know who I am talking to?"'

Trend Pirouette: The Return of Ballet Flats: [Style Desk]

Full text: Six ideal pairs of one of the season's trendiest (but hardest to get right) shoes.
While there's no doubt that ballet flats are everywhere right now, the definition of what constitutes a ballet flat is somewhat elastic. Here are some helpful parameters to keep in mind when looking for a pair of your own:
They are roughly the shape of ballet slippers with a round toe. (This seems obvious, but there's a lot of room for error.) They can have a little heel but nothing higher than a half an inch. An open toe is a no. Straps are sometimes allowed, but anything too hefty or with a buckle turns a shoe into a Mary Jane. An elastic strap works (as on the extremely popular varieties from Miu Miu or, even better, the ones from the Row). And that's it.
Maybe you're not sure how to feel about the return of this trend. Maybe, like me, you went through a ballet-flat phase a couple of decades ago and thought you were done with them. Did you love the aggressively rounded toes? Did you, like Amy Winehouse, wear them so often they were the color of hot dog water? Did you often return from a day walking around in them only to wonder why flat shoes that seemed so practical were in fact deeply uncomfortable?
Do you want to try them again, but are not sure how?
The best advice, which you must try to heed, is to resist the siren song of dressing like a ballerina. I love leotards and tiny wrap sweaters as much as the next Balanchine devotee, but don't wear ballet flats with them. Ballet flats that look too much like pointe shoes or have attached ribbons come across as costume-y.
Anyone who was obsessed with "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" knows that shoes like this wear out easily. So while you may find secondhand eggplant-colored Dior ballet flats with a braid or chocolate brown suede Lilly Pulitzer ones with a champagne metallic trim, you will have to sort through a lot of really worn-out pairs.
When you find the right ballet flats for you, get a cobbler to put a slip resistant tread on the soles, which will give the shoes a longer life. While you're there, get a padded insole to make them a little easier to wear.
Chanel
It turns out ballet dancers do wear ballet flats. Jenelle Manzi, who dances with the New York City Ballet, said on Instagram that she "can't even look at" one popular brand, "mostly because I think about the poor bones in my feet, but I got the perfect pair of ballet flats in Paris last summer at Chanel."
If a ballerina endorsement doesn't move you, know that Chanel ballet flats look good with everything. Also, they have a cap toe, and sometimes the toe contrasts with the rest of the flat, like a black toe with a pastel tweed, or a navy toe with a blue-green leather body. This being Chanel, notorious for its low levels of stock, you have to go in person and see what is available in your size. If you find any crayon-style colors in a size 39 -- taxi yellow, bright blue -- call me immediately. ( $ 875)
Maison Margiela
Maison Margiela is known for its many variations of the split-toe tabi shoe. Its fans are devoted to the tabi boots, but I think the tabi ballet flat is the friendliest entry point into that world. My friend Kat pointed me to the satin ones. "They're the softest tabis (spiritually)," she texted. The colors are really incredible -- deep violet, dark sage green, chestnut brown -- and would look good with any kind of jeans, but even better with oversize tailored trousers and a loose oxford shirt. ( $ 345, from $ 690)
Khaite
Khaite makes ballet flats with studded with Swarovski crystals. The best are black satin with the crystals in a kind of harlequin pattern. The more elaborate and luxe the ballet flat, the better it looks dressed down. So wear these with track shorts in the summer and a white ribbed tank top and you'll be the coolest person at the grocery store. ( $ 980)
The Row
Ballet flats can look a little too preppy when worn with skirts and dresses. They need the structure and square toe of these satin ones from the Row. How good would the cranberry red pair look peeking out from under a long black dress at some kind of spring gala? The bonus is that this is the next most comfortable thing with the exception of socks to wear to a long party. ( $ 790)
Reike Nen
It's easy to take for granted the delicate bows of many ballet flats. They're just kind of there, looking perfect. This pair has an elongated toe box and a bow that hits the middle of the foot, instead of at the toe. "The Reikes are more substantial as a styling element," said Anna Gray, who owns Club Vintage in Manhattan, a South Street Seaport shop that sells this style. So even though they are as versatile as a black shoe should be, they are subtly more elegant. And slightly less innocent. And so are you! ( $ 280, from $ 350)
Mansur Gavriel
Mansur Gavriel makes ballet flats with a high vamp, which some people prefer to showing a lot of toe cleavage. They do all the basic colors (Repetto and Margaux and French Sole also have a range of great shades), but the most exciting version is made of raffia. With white linen pants? Or what about Pleats Please pants for a contrast of soft and natural meets futuristic? ( $ 395)

Full text: The biggest presence on the runways of Paris Fashion Week (other than a big black overcoat) was feathers. Why?
The runways of Paris have felt heavy this season. But among the inky overcoats with bold shoulders, the long black leather jackets and solemn silhouettes that encase the body like armor, a lighter trend was taking flight: feathers.
At Loewe, goose plumes were densely layered to create long-sleeved tops, shorts and pants; at Victoria Beckham, a large ostrich feather rippled out from under trench coats and pantsuits or was tucked into the plunging neckline of a floor-skimming evening dress.
In his debut collection for Ann Demeulemeester, Ludovic de Saint Sernin presented identical looks at the start and finish -- a fluid silk maxi-skirt and feather bandeau in leather resting across the model's breasts (intended, he said, to look like a writing quill). At Chanel, large marabou clusters fluttered from a simple black knitted shift; and at Valentino, feathery crests stood at attention to accent crisp poplin shirts, thigh-skimming miniskirts and a showstopping black and white diagonally striped coat.
Feathers have long been fashion week favorite for designers. But at a time when the world feels increasingly somber and austere, their presence offered a soft and airy contrast to much of the grounded and wearable clothing on display -- and a particularly poignant nod to those dreaming of escape.
This was on display in the ostrich feathers that trimmed sharp suiting and fluted sleeves on cocktail gowns at the Turkish label Dice Kayek, whose creative director, Ece Ege, said she had been absorbed by the devastation caused by the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria last month. A similar notion was at the heart of the latest collection from Bevza, a Ukrainian label that has shown at New York Fashion Week in recent years.
"In our world of oppression, pressure and anxiety, we need freedom, lightness and the ability to fly," said its founder, Svitlana Bevza, who was showing in Paris for the first time. "We need wings, to soar above the chaos and glide to freedom."
Minimalist white minidresses came with detachable winglike sleeves. A black sheath had capped shoulders that were finished with ruffling silk "feathers," hand-cut in Ms. Bevza's Kyiv atelier, amid air raid sirens and blackouts.
For centuries, feathers have offered the promise of transformation. But there is a price to pay, especially when there is still widespread evidence of cruelty in the global down and feather industries. Stella McCartney tried to point this out at her show, which took place against a backdrop of galloping horses at the École Militaire, France's oldest riding school.
"There's so much leather and feathers on the runway, especially in winter, and I just wanted to show that you can do it in a different way," Ms. McCartney said after her show, which included crocodile-effect AppleSkin from apple waste and a white handbag made from Mylo (a material made from the fungus mycelium).
In time, they too may take off.

No city manages to function as both a mirror and crystal ball during fashion week quite like Paris, where the scenes outside and inside the shows often contain the truest glimpses of what is trendy now and what will be hot next.
What’s relevant now can be discerned on the street, where a sea of skirts suggested the garment has become a wardrobe staple regardless of gender. Most styles were long, and many were patterned. On colder days, some of the skirts were layered over trousers, a combination that stood out more when the pants were baggier.
As for where fits — the sizes and shapes of clothes, that is — may be headed, brands offered clues on their runways. Balenciaga showed tops with contorted proportions that made models look kind of like turtles. Valentino presented boxy jackets with super short shorts. And a few designers, Loewe among them, experimented with straps, embellishing garments with long chains or strips of material meant to be worn over a shoulder like the handle of a bag.

Black Equestrians Plead for Helmets That'll Fit: [National Desk]

Full text: Chanel Robbins has been riding horses most of her life, ever since her grandmother traded a cow from their family's farm in Ontario for a pony when she was 7.
Galloping through the fields on her pony, Star, offered an escape from thoughts that weighed on her -- that she didn't have a relationship with her biological parents, for instance, or that she was the only Black girl in the neighborhood, aside from her sister.
About eight years ago, she reconnected with her father, a native of Jamaica. As the two grew closer, Ms. Robbins decided to style her hair in locs, like her dad. But there was a problem: Her riding helmet no longer fit, and she couldn't find one that did.
"I finally freaking feel like myself, and now society is asking me to change," Ms. Robbins, 27, of Alliston, Ontario, said as she choked back tears. "I just want to be able to ride."
Black equestrians have long felt virtually invisible in a sport that remains overwhelmingly white. For those with natural hair, which for many is a declaration of pride and Black identity, finding a helmet that fits properly can be nearly impossible, creating yet another barrier to full inclusion. Some are now lobbying for change, mindful that horseback riding is among the leading causes of sports-related traumatic brain injury. The helmet companies say there isn't a simple fix.
Among those raising awareness on social media is Caitlin Gooch, who grew up riding horses on her family's farm in Wendell, N.C. For Ms. Gooch, 30, who wears her hair in locs that fall to her mid-back, safety has been of paramount concern because her father injured his neck in a fall from a horse when he was not wearing a helmet. When she has her hair redone, about once every two months, she brings her riding helmet with her to ensure it will still fit.
Around 2015, when she started teaching riding lessons, she found herself having to tell children they couldn't ride if there was no helmet that properly fit them. In 2021, she started a hashtag, #saddleuphelmeton, to call attention to the problem.
Trying to stuff a head into a helmet that doesn't fit presents a safety risk, not unlike "trying to fit a baby into a car seat that doesn't fit them," Ms. Gooch said. "The helmet just would not do what it was supposed to do."
'People Are Different, Hair Is Different'
Several prominent equestrian helmet manufacturers contacted by The New York Times said they were not aware that many Black riders struggled with helmet fit. Others said they recognized that it was an issue and were working to address it, while cautioning that bringing a new helmet to market is a costly undertaking that can take years.
The Times spoke with nearly a dozen Black riders, several of whom described searches for properly fitting helmets that dragged on for months or even years. Some said they had been turned away from equestrian stores by employees who said they couldn't help them. A few said they had manipulated helmets by stuffing them or cutting the lining.
Isabella Tillman, who wears her hair in natural, buoyant curls in the summer and straightens it in the winter, is horrified when she thinks about the helmets she has used in 20 years of riding.
One sat atop her head like a traffic cone, she said. Another was so small it gave her headaches. And one was so big, she had to stuff it with maxi pads.
"There is nothing out there in the industry that is addressing these needs," said Ms. Tillman, 29, of Detroit, who is working toward becoming an equine veterinarian. "People are different, hair is different and heads are different."
'A Big Issue for a Small Amount of People'
It is not clear exactly how many riders are affected. The United States Equestrian Federation, one of the major governing bodies overseeing competitive horse sports, does not require its 447,000 members to disclose their race, and only about half do so. Of those, nearly 92 percent are white, with Black riders making up only 0.5 percent.
Helmet inclusivity is important, Black equestrians said, because it could mean the difference between life and death. A 2019 study published in the journal Sports Medicine found that 70 percent of reported equestrian falls caused a head injury. Wearing a properly fitting helmet helped prevent more serious injuries, such as skull fractures, the study found.
Dr. Thomas A. Connor, an engineer who has researched equestrian helmet safety and was a co-author of the study, said that the difficulty many Black riders had in finding helmets was "a big issue for a small amount of people."
"There's a real need to address it and absolutely zero desire to do it," he said. "If you owned a helmet company you could decide to solve this problem tomorrow."
Companies that make equipment used in other sports have taken steps to adapt helmets and other gear to accommodate Black athletes' natural hair.
Riddell, one of the leading manufacturers of helmets used by N.F.L. players, has developed a helmet with customized "precision-fit" padding, ensuring that any hairstyle will fit. And last year, the International Swimming Federation approved the Soul Cap, which accommodates thicker, curlier hair, for use in major competitions.
No Quick Fix
Equestrian helmet manufacturers say it is not as simple for them because the safety standards and certification-testing requirements are vastly different from other sports.
Laura Qusen, chief operating officer at Tipperary Equestrian, said she was not aware of the challenges Black riders faced in finding helmets until Ms. Robbins, the rider from Ontario, wrote to the company in January.
In an interview, Ms. Qusen acknowledged that it was "clearly not a one-person problem" and committed to investigating it further. But she worried that developing a new helmet would require new safety standards, potentially driving up the cost of a product for which there might not be much demand.
"If it's truly a manufacturing problem, anything is possible, but we're talking years of development," Ms. Qusen said.
The exchange with Ms. Qusen left Ms. Robbins in tears. She wondered if it was time to find a new sport, one that would make her feel like she mattered.
Charles Owen, a popular helmet company that sponsors Olympic athletes, is working on "several solutions" to help customers whose hairstyles often change and expects to introduce them sometime this year, Alex Burek, the company's marketing director, said. She declined to comment further.
But the riders' concerns have yet to reach Back on Track, a market leader that makes equestrian products, including helmets in a variety of shapes and sizes, with removable liners. In an interview, James Ruder, the chief executive, said the company's helmets can accommodate most riders. He added that he had "never once heard" about a Black rider struggling with helmet fit.
"If you have an 'oddity' -- and I don't mean to be disrespectful to the people who have weird hairstyles -- but if you have a hairstyle that impacts the functionality of the helmet, you might just have to change it," Mr. Ruder said.
In a follow-up interview, Mr. Ruder stood by his view that riders need to be aware that their hairstyle choices can affect helmet safety, and added that he intended no offense with his comments. "I'm bald, and some people find that weird," he said. "It's all relative."
'This Sport Isn't Designed for Us.'
Black riders say the manufacturers' responses demonstrate what they're up against.
"Sports were only developed for white people and they continue to keep white people protected," Ms. Robbins said. "People need to realize diversity and inclusion belongs anywhere, especially in sports."
A new helmet can't come fast enough for Aderes James, 10, of Bethesda, Md.
On competition mornings, the other girls on her hunter show team tuck their hair into their helmets to create a clean look that will impress the judges. Aderes follows a two-hour routine the night before with conditioners and detangler spray. Her mother then plaits her thick hair into two Dutch braids that fit under her helmet for the show ring.
"It makes me feel a little left out," Aderes said. "But it's the cost of healthy, curly hair."
Her mother, Rena Baxter James, said she and her husband made it a priority for Aderes to embrace her natural hair, but it often felt like an obstacle.
"You're asking people to change the texture of their hair instead of learning how to offer a proper fit," she said, adding that "mostly everything in this sport isn't designed for us."
'Like Reopening a Wound Every Time'
Chauntel Smith and Jenny Benton have become quite adept at manipulating young riders' heads into helmets.
The two co-founded a Minnesota nonprofit, CREW Urban Youth Equestrians, in 2021 to provide opportunities for Black youth and other children of color to learn about horses while developing tools to manage their emotions. Getting a helmet to work is often a time-consuming task that can take away from saddle time, they said.
"It's like reopening a wound every time," Ms. Smith, who is Black, said. "And it's so counterproductive to the purpose of why they are out here at the barn, to have a safe space."
Ms. Tillman, the aspiring equine veterinarian from Detroit, eventually replaced the helmet she'd stuffed with maxi pads with a new one, cutting pieces of the lining out until it nestled comfortably on her head. But now she worries.
"It makes me feel less comfortable about the safety of a helmet that I'm just doing this myself," she said. "It certainly doesn't make me feel included or that people with hair textures like mine are important."

Black Equestrians Want to Be Safe. But They Can’t Find Helmets.

Chanel Robbins has been riding horses most of her life, ever since her grandmother traded a cow from their family’s farm in Ontario for a pony when she was 7.
Galloping through the fields on her pony, Star, offered an escape from thoughts that weighed on her — that she didn’t have a relationship with her biological parents, for instance, or that she was the only Black girl in the neighborhood, aside from her sister.
About eight years ago, she reconnected with her father, a native of Jamaica. As the two grew closer, Robbins decided to style her hair in dreadlocks, like her dad. But there was a problem: Her riding helmet no longer fit, and she couldn’t find one that did.
“I finally freaking feel like myself, and now society is asking me to change,” Robbins, 27, of Alliston, Ontario, said as she choked back tears. “I just want to be able to ride.”
Black equestrians have long felt virtually invisible in a sport that remains overwhelmingly white. For those with natural hair, which for many is a declaration of pride and Black identity, finding a helmet that fits properly can be nearly impossible, creating yet another barrier to full inclusion. Some are now lobbying for change, mindful that horseback riding is among the leading causes of sports-related traumatic brain injury. Helmet companies say there isn’t a simple fix.
Among those raising awareness on social media is Caitlin Gooch, who grew up riding horses on her family’s farm in Wendell, North Carolina. For Gooch, 30, who wears her hair in locs that fall to her mid-back, safety has been of paramount concern because her father injured his neck in a fall from a horse when he was not wearing a helmet. When she has her hair redone, about once every two months, she brings her riding helmet with her to ensure it will still fit.
Around 2015, when she started teaching riding lessons, she found herself having to tell children they couldn’t ride if there was no helmet that properly fit them. In 2021, she started a hashtag, #saddleuphelmeton, to call attention to the problem.
Trying to stuff a head into a helmet that doesn’t fit presents a safety risk, not unlike “trying to fit a baby into a car seat that doesn’t fit them,” Gooch said. “The helmet just would not do what it was supposed to do.”
‘People Are Different, Hair Is Different’
Several prominent equestrian helmet manufacturers contacted by The New York Times said they were not aware that many Black riders struggled with helmet fit. Others said they recognized that it was an issue and were working to address it, while cautioning that bringing a new helmet to market is a costly undertaking that can take years.
The Times spoke with nearly a dozen Black riders, several of whom described searches for properly fitting helmets that dragged on for months or even years. Some said they had been turned away from equestrian stores by employees who said they couldn’t help them. A few said they had manipulated helmets by stuffing them or cutting the lining.
Isabella Tillman, who wears her hair in natural, buoyant curls in the summer and straightens it in the winter, is horrified when she thinks about the helmets she has used in 20 years of riding.
One sat atop her head like a traffic cone, she said. Another was so small it gave her headaches. And one was so big, she had to stuff it with maxi pads.
“There is nothing out there in the industry that is addressing these needs,” said Tillman, 29, of Detroit, who is working toward becoming an equine veterinarian. “People are different, hair is different and heads are different.”
‘A Big Issue for a Small Amount of People’
It is not clear exactly how many riders are affected. The U.S. Equestrian Federation, one of the major governing bodies overseeing competitive horse sports, does not require its 447,000 members to disclose their race, and only about half do so. Of those, nearly 92% are white, with Black riders making up only 0.5%.
Helmet inclusivity is important, Black equestrians said, because it could mean the difference between life and death. A 2019 study published in the journal Sports Medicine found that 70% of reported equestrian falls caused a head injury. Wearing a properly fitting helmet helped prevent more serious injuries, such as skull fractures, the study found.
Thomas A. Connor, an engineer who has researched equestrian helmet safety and was a co-author of the study, said that the difficulty many Black riders had in finding helmets was “a big issue for a small amount of people.”
“There’s a real need to address it and absolutely zero desire to do it,” he said. “If you owned a helmet company you could decide to solve this problem tomorrow.”
Companies that make equipment used in other sports have taken steps to adapt helmets and other gear to accommodate Black athletes’ natural hair.
Riddell, one of the leading manufacturers of helmets used by NFL players, has developed a helmet with customized “precision-fit” padding, ensuring that any hairstyle will fit. And last year, the International Swimming Federation approved the Soul Cap, which accommodates thicker, curlier hair, for use in major competitions.
No Quick Fix
Equestrian helmet manufacturers say it is not as simple for them because the safety standards and certification-testing requirements are vastly different from other sports.
Laura Qusen, chief operating officer at Tipperary Equestrian, said she was not aware of the challenges Black riders faced in finding helmets until Robbins, the rider from Ontario, wrote to the company in January.
In an interview, Qusen acknowledged that it was “clearly not a one-person problem” and committed to investigating it further. But she worried that developing a new helmet would require new safety standards, potentially driving up the cost of a product for which there might not be much demand.
“If it’s truly a manufacturing problem, anything is possible, but we’re talking years of development,” Qusen said.
The exchange with Qusen left Robbins in tears. She wondered if it was time to find a new sport, one that would make her feel like she mattered.
Charles Owen, a popular helmet company that sponsors Olympic athletes, is working on “several solutions” to help customers whose hairstyles often change and expects to introduce them sometime this year, Alex Burek, the company’s marketing director, said. She declined to comment further.
But the riders’ concerns have yet to reach Back on Track, a market leader that makes equestrian products, including helmets in a variety of shapes and sizes, with removable liners. In an interview, James Ruder, the chief executive, said the company’s helmets can accommodate most riders. He added that he had “never once heard” about a Black rider struggling with helmet fit.
“If you have an ‘oddity’ — and I don’t mean to be disrespectful to the people who have weird hairstyles — but if you have a hairstyle that impacts the functionality of the helmet, you might just have to change it,” Ruder said.
In a follow-up interview, Ruder stood by his view that riders need to be aware that their hairstyle choices can affect helmet safety, and added that he intended no offense with his comments. “I’m bald, and some people find that weird,” he said. “It’s all relative.”
‘This Sport Isn’t Designed for Us’
Black riders say the manufacturers’ responses demonstrate what they’re up against.
“Sports were only developed for white people and they continue to keep white people protected,” Robbins said. “People need to realize diversity and inclusion belongs anywhere, especially in sports.”
A new helmet can’t come fast enough for Aderes James, 10, of Bethesda, Maryland.
On competition mornings, the other girls on her hunter show team tuck their hair into their helmets to create a clean look that will impress the judges. Aderes follows a two-hour routine the night before with conditioners and detangler spray. Her mother then plaits her thick hair into two Dutch braids that fit under her helmet for the show ring.
“It makes me feel a little left out,” Aderes said. “But it’s the cost of healthy, curly hair.”
Her mother, Rena Baxter James, said she and her husband made it a priority for Aderes to embrace her natural hair, but it often felt like an obstacle.
“You’re asking people to change the texture of their hair instead of learning how to offer a proper fit,” she said, adding that “mostly everything in this sport isn’t designed for us.”
‘Like Reopening a Wound Every Time’
Chauntel Smith and Jenny Benton have become quite adept at manipulating young riders’ heads into helmets.
The two co-founded a Minnesota nonprofit, CREW Urban Youth Equestrians, in 2021 to provide opportunities for Black youth and other children of color to learn about horses while developing tools to manage their emotions. Getting a helmet to work is often a time-consuming task that can take away from saddle time, they said.
“It’s like reopening a wound every time,” Smith, who is Black, said. “And it’s so counterproductive to the purpose of why they are out here at the barn, to have a safe space.”
Tillman, the aspiring equine veterinarian from Detroit, eventually replaced the helmet she’d stuffed with maxi pads with a new one, cutting pieces of the lining out until it nestled comfortably on her head. But now she worries.
“It makes me feel less comfortable about the safety of a helmet that I’m just doing this myself,” she said. “It certainly doesn’t make me feel included or that people with hair textures like mine are important.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Louis Vuitton Turns to Pharrell Williams: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The rapper and music producer will succeed Virgil Abloh and "lead Louis Vuitton toward a new and very exciting chapter," the brand said in a statement.
The fashion and entertainment industries, which have long been intertwined, converged even further on Tuesday when Louis Vuitton named Pharrell Williams, the American rapper and producer, as its new creative director for men's wear.
The French luxury brand announced on Instagram that it had hired Mr. Williams about 16 months after the sudden death of its previous men's wear designer, Virgil Abloh, in 2021. Mr. Williams, the brand said in a statement, "is a visionary whose creative universes expand from music to art, and to fashion -- establishing himself as a cultural global icon."
Other names floated as successors to Mr. Abloh have included the British designers Grace Wales Bonner and Martine Rose, as well as the American designers Telfar Clemens and Colm Dillane, better known as KidSuper, who last month was announced as Louis Vuitton's first ever men's wear guest designer, a sign many took to mean that he had been tapped to follow Mr. Abloh.
But it was ultimately Mr. Williams, 49, who landed what is considered one of the most high-profile creative director roles in men's fashion. His appointment was the first major move by Louis Vuitton's new chief executive, Pietro Beccari, who joined the brand from Dior last month.
Mr. Williams, who was the first male ambassador for Chanel, has worked off and on with Louis Vuitton since 2004. More recently, he entered into a collaboration with the jeweler Tiffany & Company, which with Louis Vuitton is part of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. During the January men's wear shows in Paris, Mr. Williams was seldom without his pair of diamond-studded Tiffany & Company sunglasses, which he also wore to the Grammys. His first collection for Louis Vuitton will be shown in June at Men's Fashion Week in Paris.
"I am glad to welcome Pharrell back home, after our collaborations in 2004 and 2008 for Louis Vuitton, as our new men's artistic director," Mr. Beccari said in the brand's statement on Instagram. "His creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton toward a new and very exciting chapter."
Mr. Williams's return to Louis Vuitton is also a return to men's wear design. Earlier this century, he created influential streetwear brands like Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream in partnership with the Japanese designer Nigo (who is now the artistic director at Kenzo, which is also owned by LVMH).
Still, Mr. Williams's appointment to the pinnacle of high-end ready-to-wear underscores an apparent trend among luxury goods makers: to put their futures in the hands of multi-hyphenate celebrities, not designers by profession. Other high-profile entertainers to be embraced by luxury fashion in recent years include Rihanna, whose Fenty clothing line in partnership with LVMH shuttered in 2021, and the troubled rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, who became a fixture at fashion weeks around the world.
Spectacle is now a given at runway shows: The recent Louis Vuitton men's wear event in Paris, for instance, featured astonishingly expensive sets, a front row studded with stars from the worlds of K-Pop, Hollywood and hip-hop, and a supercharged performance by the Spanish singer Rosalía, who sang from atop a souped-up car.
Louis Vuitton, which was founded in 1854, is the cornerstone of the fortune amassed by LVMH's founder and chief executive Bernard Arnault, who was recently ranked the world's richest person. While men's wear constitutes a relatively modest percentage of overall revenue for the brand, it remains a source of optimism as the fastest growing sector in a luxury goods industry that continues to struggle against headwinds induced by the global pandemic and the loss of markets in both China and Russia.

Full text: The best looks from the Saks, LaQuan Smith and Document Journal after-parties.
New York Fashion Week rolled into town and left behind a sea of empty champagne bottles.
Saks kicked things off on Feb. 8 with a cocktail party a few blocks from its Fifth Avenue flagship, hosted by Emma Roberts at the Jazz Club at the Aman New York. Two nights later, Document Journal and Loewe Perfumes held a throbbing dance party atop the new Virgin Hotel in Manhattan. Guests marveled at the glittery skyline and danced till the early morning under the hypnotic beats of the Carry Nation and Fatherhood.
And LaQuan Smith held a playful after-party at the Moxy LES on Feb. 13 that felt like a celebration of self-expressive fashion. The celebrity-filled crowd included Lil Nas X, Teyana Taylor, Ice Spice and Diplo.
Lil Nas X turned New York Fashion Week into his own private runway, turning up in front rows and after-parties in one bedazzled outfit after the next.
Eric André and Emily Ratajkowski showed up at LaQuan Smith's after-party, a day before going Instagram official on Valentine's Day.
'It's a balaclava I made from rainbow fur, inspired by "Monsters, Inc." I like the character Sulley. He's a monster with a good heart.' -- Ravishin Swiss at Document Journal
Charlie XCX and Big Freedia performed at the Saks party to a smartly dressed crowd nibbling on pizza and caviar bumps.
'The camo jacket was inspired by André Leon Talley's infamous Norma Kamali wrap coat. I wanted to pay homage to one of my inspirations.' -- Armiel Chandler at LaQuan Smith
The Most Dressed features great outfits from up, down and all around town.

12 Trans Americans On Transgender Rights: [Sunday Review Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: THESE days, "transgender" has become a charged word, associated with arguments over identity, gender, pronouns, sports, puberty blockers and civil rights. But for many of the approximately 1.3 million transgender Americans today, the word isn't a topic for debate; it's who they are. And the questions and fights over being transgender often feel beside the point. Why are so many nontrans Americans judging and opining about trans adults and children rather than listening to them? We spoke with 12 transgender Americans from across the country and the political spectrum to try to better understand what their lives are like. In the course of our conversation, it became clear that while our participants had some common experiences -- 11 of them said they'd experienced discrimination or harassment as a consequence of their trans identity, several said they'd had fraught experiences choosing which restroom to use, and some knew they were trans at a very young age -- no two trans experiences are exactly the same. Some participants had families supportive of who they are; others did not. There was no uniform perspective on when or whether children should be allowed to transition or on whether there was too much or not enough media coverage of trans issues (and whether that coverage was getting it right). But fundamentally, all participants wanted basic respect -- to be seen as people, not stereotypes or caricatures or a minority to be lectured to. "I think people might assume that I am unwilling to see our shared humanity," said Forest, a 26-year-old in the group. "In reality, I'm actually trying really hard to see people who I disagree with as also human, just like me, who have positives and negatives, who have different experiences but who might still be able to change their minds and care about other people, too. I'm trying to."
PARTICIPANTS Amber 47, Dem., Latinx Chanel 38, Dem., Black C.J. 57, ind., white Forest 26, Dem., mixed race Joey 46, ind., white Joseph 37, Dem., white Kayla 28, Dem., Black Michelle 54, ind., white Milo 40, Dem., white Phunky 19, Dem., Black Tavona 27, ind., Black Wyatt 31, Dem., white
When did you realize you were trans? Michelle: I always pretty much knew. Since I was 5, I used to dress in my mom's stuff. I tried to suppress it. I went in the Army, tried all the macho stuff. I said, "This ain't right," because I was brought up in a stricter time. One day, I just couldn't do it anymore. I woke up and told my wife. She went ballistic. I thought maybe this is something we could work out together, and she didn't want to. She said, "I don't want to live with another woman." And I said, "Well, this is what I want to do. I'm going to transition fully, and I plan to in the next five years." Kayla: I came out as bisexual at first. Then I started seeing other trans people, and I had kind of a conflict. I wondered, "Am I attracted to these people, or do I want to be these people?" And then, wanting to transition, I asked myself, "Am I doing this because I want the privilege of passing as a man?" My partner was not supportive, interestingly enough, even though she was a very big L.G.B.T.Q. advocate where I lived. We broke up. But it wasn't until I started immersing myself into the queer community that I really started to feel who I actually was. C.J.: I knew really early, as far back as I can remember. So 2, 3? People would ask me, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" I'd say, "A man." I just assumed that that's what I would be when I grew up, that it was going to change. Moderator: How many of you have experienced discrimination or harassment because of your trans identity? [Eleven participants raise a hand.] Is this something that happens frequently? Has it happened recently? Wyatt: Just, like, dumb bathroom stuff. I've been harassed in the bathroom before for going to the "wrong" one. But what do you want me to do? Should I just go in between the bathrooms? Kayla: I pass as what society would consider a man. I've been to a bar in D.C. where the men's bathroom just had urinals, and there was a long line for the women's. I hate when I have to out myself just to relieve myself. I get so much anxiety. If I walk in and there's not a stall or not a door on the stall, I pray someone doesn't walk in. That's where a lot of the harassment for myself happens. Tavona: I definitely agree. The times where I have been harassed, I've been trying to use the restroom. I'm on active-duty military. I'm in the Navy, so we all share a ship. To be politically correct, my sex marker hasn't changed, so I have to shower and use the restroom that the females use, and that's a bit of a challenge. Phunky: My friends and I are all very visibly queer. A lot of times I dress up very, very visibly queer, and people are constantly looking at me, constantly taking pictures of me, constantly making comments, you know? Joseph: I wish I could have said zero. I have actively been harassed, had graffiti and all that on my apartment, my lockers at work. I've been chased by pickup trucks when I was walking home at night and had beer bottles smashed up against my head just because of who I am. In the last couple of years, do you think things are getting better or worse for trans Americans? Milo: I'm comparing from the Trump administration to now, so I think the bar is low. There's a little bit more openness from this administration. Phunky:I live in New York, and there's a lot of accessibility for being trans. A lot of surgeries can get covered with your insurance, and there's a big queer community here, so it's very easy to be accepted and to find trans friends and queer friends. Mutual aid is really big here, too. I feel like there are a lot more resources than -- I would say, I don't know -- in the '90s. C.J.: I think that's a tricky question. Because like somebody mentioned, it got really dicey when Trump was in. And we still have some politicians acting like juveniles. Amber: When it comes to the politics, I pretty much keep to myself. I'm more concerned with the finances. That's what I do for a living. So I see the numbers, and it's going to take a few years for the economy to roll back. I think that once that happens, things will definitely change for the better. When it comes to safety, I feel like I'm in a moderate to safe zone. Joseph:I don't want to be a whole downer, but it almost feels like we're losing the ground we've gained. We continue to get more acceptance and visibility. But when Roe v. Wade was taken away by the courts -- I'm honestly terrified that they're going to find a way to take even more away in some way. Moderator: What do you think is standing in the way of things getting better for transgender people? Kayla: Cis white men. That's who makes up our government. That's who's making all these dumb decisions. They're focusing on the wrong things as well, the whole anti-trans legislation across several states. The most dangerous, I think, was the one in Texas when they were reporting parents to C.P.S. for supporting their trans kid. C.J.:Well, there's too much negative coverage and not enough positive coverage. Moderator: Is there something that the news media is missing when it talks about trans issues? Kayla: They're not reporting on the right things, or they report on something, and things just get completely twisted. Facts are wrong, deadnaming people. It's just not actually information, I guess. Like they're not actually spreading actual facts or actual news. I feel like a lot of it ends up supporting a lot of misconceptions about trans people. Moderator: Sometimes when I speak with groups of people who don't consider themselves part of the transgender community, they say they are worried they might get in trouble if they say the wrong thing or use the wrong pronoun. What do you think when people say these things? Joseph: I would rather somebody actually make the effort to try and fail and be corrected at it and actually go, "OK, sorry," and just move on. Put in the effort. Forest: People say they're worried about saying the wrong thing. I know that you're worried. I can feel it. And I can't make you understand. But if you try to see from my perspective, then I'm pretty sure your imagination will allow you to see from my perspective. Kayla: If you're scared of saying the wrong thing, go educate yourself. And if you do say something wrong, don't get defensive after. It's not my job to then carry your feelings. Within my community, people know that I'm a person that they can come to if they want to talk or if they want more information. But not every trans person is that person. So don't expect an education lesson. Moderator: How, if at all, do you think ideas around gender identity should be discussed and taught in schools -- elementary school, junior high school, high school? Joey: I think it should be taught early on because some kids may not be aware of how they're feeling. It would have helped me if it had been taught early on. Wyatt: Yeah. I mean there are lots of kids' books that are totally appropriate that just talk about gender in a general way. "Red: A Crayon's Story" is a good one. Chanel: Yeah, I think the sooner, the better. I taught elementary for 10 years, and it was something that I always tied into my lessons. I don't think a lot of people recognize that racism, transphobic, homophobic thoughts are learned at a young age. Tavona: I see where Chanel is coming from, but I also think that gender identity should not be taught prior to maybe high school. I just feel like the younger, the more impressionable. Not only will they be trying to figure out other things, aside from themselves, but adding in gender identity is just a bit too much for younger kids, I think. Do you have any thoughts on the question of when young people with gender dysphoria should be allowed to begin transitioning? Michelle: I guess between the age of 13 and maybe 18, somewhere around there. It's a confusing time, so I think that it starts with family first. They got to decide for their child. If their child comes up to them and says, "Look, something's not right here," then have a discussion with that child first. I really don't think there's any place for school here because, to me, it's more of a personal medical issue, a political or social issue. Amber: Family is going to be your main support. It's going to be up to the family, the parents. Moderator: How do you think parents should approach a young person or teenager who says they're interested in transitioning? Amber: Get your sources, get your information, get your education. I'm in my late 40s now. If I would have known about these groups much sooner, I know I would have stepped up and taken those actions before I told my mom. Phunky: I don't know how I feel about children medically transitioning at a young age. That's based on their individual situation. There are things they could do that could help them affirm their gender, like changing their clothes or hairstyle or things like that. But if the child doesn't have a supportive family, I feel like the school should have some type of peer counseling where these kids could be able to talk about this in a safe space. Moderator: Is there an age that's too young? Phunky: As long as there's nothing irreversible, as long as you can go back on it, your child should be able to transition. I see a lot of children that do transition at a young age, and they don't detransition or start questioning their gender. But I do feel like it should be more of a one-on-one thing. Joseph:If I could have had the chance to actually transition or even just start H.R.T. from a younger age, I would have taken it and not had a second thought. Far too many kids are out there without information about transitioning, and some even consider taking their own lives because they get in a situation where they don't have any support. Moderator: What would you say to parents who say they're conflicted or uncomfortable with teenagers taking puberty blockers? Phunky: I'm 19. I feel like people should be able to have more responsibility, and I feel like it's very important to affirm your child and your teenager. You don't know what your child is going through. You don't know what your teenager is going through. There's so many trans people that would have loved to be on H.R.T. when they were a teen, would have loved to start their transition. And I feel like there's not enough recognition around that. Forest: Why did you have a kid? Did you have a child so that you could model that child after you, or did you have a child so that you could bring a person into the world who is capable of and confident in making their own decisions? Michelle: I believe if the child believes that they want to be that way, they should go to a psychiatrist, talk to counselors, maybe talk to someone in the trans community and everything else first before you even start that. Because once it starts, it's a slippery slope. C.J.: As a parent, you're responsible for that child until they're 18, and the frontal lobe's not developed until 24. That being said, I knew who I was my entire life. Being supported and being able to be who I was was great. I could have done it at 17 or 18, had I known how and had the resources. Then it wouldn't have been the parent's responsibility. Moderator: Is there anything that you would want to leave New York Times readers with, as just a final thought? C.J.: Trans people are just people. Not pedophiles and not perverts. Kayla: Stop trying to understand us. If you're not trans, you never will. I feel like a lot of times, people are just trying to make sense of us in their head, and I need you to stop trying to make sense and just respect us as people. We're human beings, and we're just going to live our lives just like you are living your lives. Stop trying to understand and interject yourself and just listen. Joey: Just love everybody and let everybody be who they want to be. Chanel:I have a quote up in my living room. It says, "I was a woman born with a male defect. After decades of pressure to live with it, I finally fixed it. So why are people so hung up on transitioning? It was a revelation. I didn't become female. I've always been female." Milo: I think we all have a right to self-determination and to self-actualization. The more we just respect each other and trust that we are doing what's right for ourselves, I think it's just a happier society and a more loving community that we can create.

Full text: In Paris last month, at the Chanel couture show, there was something about one model that set her apart from the others on the runway.
Strikingly beautiful, Jill Kortleve has almond-shaped eyes, dark bushy eyebrows and chiseled cheekbones. Since her runway debut for Alexander McQueen in 2018, she has appeared on many magazine covers, modeled in Versace, MaxMara and Jacquemus shows, and starred in advertising campaigns for Valentino Beauty and Fendi, to name but a few.
But what makes her an unusual star for the high fashion industry is not the fact that she is 29, making her older than many of her peers, or that she is 5-foot-8, making her shorter than many of them too. It is the fact that Ms. Kortleve is a U.S. size 8 to 10 -- or "midsize," as the middle ground between petite and plus size is increasingly known. "Straight" size, or under a U.S. size 2, remains, overwhelmingly, the fashion industry norm.
Plus-size models, typically those above a U.S. size 12, have become better represented in high fashion. "Curve" models like Paloma Elsesser, Precious Lee and Ashley Graham have thriving careers.
For years, however, Ms. Kortleve has been one of the only midsize models of note. In January, she was the only midsize model cast by Chanel for its couture show. There were a handful of others at shows like Valentino, but last season Ms. Kortleve was the only midsize model to be cast by the marquee names on the couture calendar.
Diversity on the runways (or the lack of it) has come under intense scrutiny in recent years. So at a time when midsize fashion is gaining momentum elsewhere -- in mass market apparel branding and on TikTok, where the #midsize hashtag has more than four billion views -- why is it still overlooked by the overlords of luxury fashion? And, in 2023, what does midsize -- or average -- sizing even mean?
'Still the Only One'
Much of the data on the average dress size in key consumer markets is out of date. Widely cited statistics that suggest the average dress size worn by British and American women is a 16 are generally from studies published in 2016 or earlier.
How certain sizes translate into measurements has shifted over time and varies substantially from brand by brand and garment to garment, which is one of the reasons millions of women find it so hard to buy clothing that fits.
"It's impossible to say with any real accuracy what the average clothing size is for a woman in the U.S.," Renee Engeln, the director of the Body and Media Lab at Northwestern University, wrote in an email. She declined to pin down midsize or plus size with a specific range.
"The landscape of women's fashion is inaccessible to many body types not because we don't understand how big or small the 'average woman' is," Dr. Engeln said. "It is because major players in the fashion industry still choose to exclude women whose bodies are inconsistent with the brand image they want to cultivate."
Ms. Kortleve, who is Dutch and partly of Surinamese heritage, may be riding high now, but she had a distressing foray into modeling after she moved to Amsterdam at 18. She was determined to be a successful "straight" size model and a size 0. She struggled at both.
"I was dieting constantly, 24/7, trying so hard to conform to the industry standard," Ms. Kortleve said in a freezing and windswept Amsterdam earlier this month. "I was antisocial, miserable and never 'thin' enough to get booked anyway, so it felt like I was starving myself for nothing."
"I had this fixed idea in my head of how models had to look in order to be successful," she continued as she sipped on a (non-diet) Coke. "My hips measured 92 centimeters, and that was still so far from good enough. For context, they measure 105 centimeters today. Finally I reached a breaking point mentally and physically. I had to walk away."
Walking away meant a long trip to Bali and getting "SELF LOVE" tattooed on her hands before returning to modeling in 2018 at a more healthy weight -- fortuitously at a time when wider depictions of beauty were emerging on high fashion runways. That September, she was booked, a virtual unknown, for an Alexander McQueen show. Thereafter, castings became more frequent until 2020, when headlines touted her as the first curve or plus-size model to walk at a Chanel show since Crystal Renn a full decade before.
Except Ms Kortleve was -- and is -- roughly a U.S. size 10. Which, outside the fashion industry, is very few people's idea of plus.
"It is problematic, for sure," Ms. Kortleve said. "I am clearly not a plus-size model, and putting me in that box takes away from the experiences that my plus-size peers have had, like not being able to find their size in a store, which is something I've never had at my size."
"I don't want to be put under any label or box, be it straight or midsize or plus size or anything else," she added.
These days, Ms. Kortleve said, people want to look in magazines or on Instagram and feel represented, particularly younger consumers. "Brands know that casting someone of a more ordinary weight like me -- what you keep calling midsize -- helps them appear closer to achieving that for customers. Even if often I am still the only one of that size there."
A Midsize Movement -- or Moment?
Alexandra van Houtte, the chief executive of Tagwalk, a fashion search engine, noted that while her platform has reference tags for 83 curve models, only three midsize models currently exist on the Tagwalk database: Ms. Kortleve, Celina Ralph and, most recently, Ajok Daing.
During the last ready-to-wear season in September, Ms. van Houtte said, more than half of all fashion week shows still had no models who weren't a dress size 0 or 2, perhaps not coincidentally at a time when ultrathin bodies appear to be back.
"Sadly, I feel like we have actually slipped backward on the runways in terms of size representation -- especially in Europe," said Kenya Hunt, the editor of Elle UK. After years of body positivity momentum, size inclusivity has stalled, in contrast to improved representation of race, as well as age and gender. Ultimately, these models can tick those diversity boxes while still being thin.
"If a model like Jill Kortleve keeps being presented to us as plus size, that alienates an entire group of women who are bigger than that," Ms. Hunt said. "It's embarrassing that an exclusionary mentality still underpins so much of this industry."
But the ordinary has long been rejected by high fashion, a world that loves to shock through visual extremes. Bony ribs (ideally) or ripples of undulating flesh (occasionally) on a runway or campaign shoot somehow seem preferable to highlighting a body that's reflective of a more "boring" middle ground. This may be a reason models with figures like Ms. Kortleve's remain underrepresented.
"A lot of model casting during fashion week is feeling increasingly performative again," said Mina White, an agent at IMG Models who added Ms. Kortleve to her roster last year. "Only one or even two curve or midsize models per show does not reflect meaningful change or true inclusivity. It's tokenism, especially if any size diversity in front of the camera is still not translating into runway fashion in mid- or plus-sizing being available on the shop floor."
Though it may be overlooked by the fashion mainstream, thousands of TikTok users who see themselves in the midsize category are creating content, including try-on hauls of midsize-friendly fashion brands and copycat outfits of luxury looks they aren't able to buy. Others offer tips on how to dress to emphasize your best features and downplay the ones you feel less confident about; there are also discussions of the manipulative power of fatphobic marketing and how to rise above it.
And despite these uplifting notes, social media can, of course, offer a portal to "thinspiration" pages and toxic messaging. But Ms. Kortleve is encouraged to see young people call out body shaming and create their own body-positive movement if fashion isn't going to give it to them.
"It makes me happy, honestly, and relieved," she said. "I feel real responsibility to represent women with a body like mine in the fashion world, but there is such pressure, too. Like, if I don't walk, or say no to a show, are they going to book another midsize girl? Or just book the old standard size and slip backward again?"
Both Ms. Kortleve and Ms. White, her agent, said better representation would be achieved only when sample sizing moves beyond the traditional size 0 and when all shoots and fittings have mid- and plus-size options, meaning that models from those categories can be booked. If pieces didn't fit or look good, collections could be curated to meet a range of body shapes.
For now, mid- and plus-size models almost always have samples made for them: one-off creations that may make magazine covers or billboards but never go into production for women to buy. For Dr. Engeln of Northwestern, the absence of an industry infrastructure that allows larger models to succeed underscores the fact that brands are still committed to the idea that skinny models make them more money, even if the midsize movement on TikTok suggests a more far-reaching market.
"In media imagery, the link between money and thinness is undeniable," she said.
The primary motivation of nearly any fashion brand is making money, she added, "not building a more inclusive industry. If they're not using more than one midsize model, it's because the brand doesn't believe they will benefit from doing so."

Full text: Fake fur at Schiaparelli, a menagerie at Chanel and an ode to Josephine Baker at Dior.
PARIS -- Ten a.m. on a frigid Monday morning, the first day of the couture shows, and Kylie Jenner was strutting through the marble halls of the Petit Palais trying to find her seat for Schiaparelli, shoehorned into spiky stilettos and a black velvet one-arm gown, a full-size tawny lion's head jutting from the side. It was as if Aslan had taken a break from Narnia and stuck his muzzle through a time-space continuum under her armpit. Or maybe it was Take Your Stuffed Toy to Work Day?
Nope: It was a dress so hot off the runway it hadn't even appeared on the runway yet -- though it was about to, along with a strapless faux-fur sheath with a snow leopard head jutting from the bust, its mouth open in mid-roar, and a big, hairy black silk and wool coat with a wolf's snout emerging from the shoulder.
Painstakingly sculpted from resin, painted by hand in the couture atelier, the faux animal heads were supposed to represent the vices of Dante's "Inferno" -- lust, pride, avarice -- according to the Schiaparelli designer Daniel Roseberry. He used the poem as something of a metaphor for his own experience with the pressure to create the new; to make everyone sit up in wonder.
To carve out a space in the attention economy. If social media and the red carpet are the fire of fame, Mr. Roseberry said, couture has become fashion's "gasoline": pour it on top and the conflagration gets ever hotter. It is "culture-making," he said. Or outrage stirring. These days, the two ideas can seem one and the same (file them under "provocation").
So the fake animal heads collided with real animal rights and Jenner/Kardashian mores, and for a time the explosion swallowed the digisphere whole. Were the looks promoting big game hunting, even though they didn't come from nature, or were they celebrating the beauty of the wild, as PETA declared, and facilitating "an anti-trophy-hunting dialogue"? Were they actually a metaphor for going after the rich -- hunting them, eating them, selling to them -- or were they a gimmick gone wrong?
Objectively, they were kind of silly, and the whole hoo-ha verged on the surreal (which makes sense for Schiaparelli, a house rooted in surrealism). But in their viral ubiquity, they also set the tone for the week, and the shows that unspooled thereafter.
Not just because Chanel also had an animal theme, courtesy of the artist Xavier Veilhan, who created a giant movable plywood bestiary for the set, in reference to Coco's favored menagerie. But because the drive to capture not just hearts and minds but eyeballs may explain the designer Virginie Viard's otherwise puzzling addition of circus-master bow ties and top hats to her flirty bouclé skirt suits; narrow, floor-sweeping coats; and drop-waist chiffon and feather frocks.
Also the upscaling of Giambattista Valli's rose-colored taffeta and tulle creations, which resembled nothing so much as sugar plum fairies on steroids. Maybe even Giorgio Armani's 77 iterations of harlequins.
Once upon a time the couture was a closed world -- that teeny tiny segment of fashion designed to showcase the art of the handmade, ruled by arcane requirements and priced so high it was accessible only by the very few: the apocryphal 200 global clients who were willing to pay the equivalent of an entry-level annual salary (and up) for a dress most of the world would never see. The price justified by artistry, know-how and the idea that what couture designers did trickled down into the wardrobes of everyone else.
Prepandemic, the party line was that couture was a social media-safe space, because it demanded the intimacy of personal experience. Now, however, powered by the gaze of the global crowd, it has begun to morph into something else. Darwin would understand.
Sure, there are still those who delight in the subtlety of a garment so mysteriously constructed it reeks of ineffable ease: the gold fil coupé Bar jackets and straight skirts Maria Grazia Chiuri offered up at Dior that somehow managed to retain their exacting shape with no interior boning; her crushed velvet bathrobe coats, gleaming with plush insouciance. In a preview, Ms. Chiuri said she had been inspired by the story of the former Dior client Josephine Baker, and her set was wrapped in paintings by the American artist Mickalene Thomas of 13 barrier-breaking women of color. It could have been heavy-handed, but instead the collection just riffed on a 1920s line, a smidgen of Jazz Age decadence woven into the cloth, the result sitting lightly on the body.
Such understatement has a power of its own, even in a moment of boldface names in pursuit of the visibly fabulous.
But it is the desire to be, said Jordan Roth, the theater impresario, collector and occasional model, "a singular piece of art on legs," that makes couture -- especially in January, as awards season gets underway -- the ultimate celebrity dress-hunting ground (and the ultimate place to hunt celebrities; see the crowds outside the show venues, which resemble nothing so much as crowds outside concert venues, shrieking and waving their smartphones). A popular game has become guess who will wear what to the Oscars/BAFTAs/Césars. Everyone can play.
At Dior, odds are the cowled sleeveless gowns fully embroidered in gleaming gold and silver thread, the jewel-tone velvets channeling a siren draped languidly over a piano, will be coming soon to a red carpet near you. Ditto Chanel's filigree white lace number with a bit of gold embroidery gleaming at the throat.
As for what the best actress nominee Michelle Yeoh, front row at Armani Privé, might choose from among all the diamonds and ruffs sprinkled over a collection that ranged from court jester to Picasso via trousers flapping an extra fabric fin at the side, caviar-bead cropped jackets and shimmering sequined gowns, there were some less -- well -- tricky, options.
But the danger in the current game of one-upmanship is that the clothes sometimes tip into the ridiculous. At Schiaparelli, Ms. Jenner (who also sat front row at Maison Margiela, where John Galliano delivered his patented brand of upcycled mayhem by mashing together tulle, tartan, fishnets, Mickey Mouse and Pendleton outerwear) and her lion head managed to overshadow not only Doja Cat, who arrived covered in 30,000 ruby crystals like some sort of émigré from an Avatar-themed Met Gala, but also the fact that there were parts of the collection that verged on the sublime.
The opening look's jacket, for example, made from hundreds of encrusted sequins tracing a perfume-bottle silhouette, over simple black pants. A pinstripe trouser suit that played with proportions so that jutting shoulders created the illusion of a Mr. Pearl-size waist, but without the rearranged organs. Breast plates made from abalone, precious stones and lemonwood marquetry that soared upward toward the throat and stretched the very definition of material.
Once all the smoke from the wild kingdom controversy had cleared, they were a reminder that sometimes, when you pour gasoline on a fire, you risk getting burned.

The Heart Motif Will Go On: [Style Desk]

Full text: Either way, you can't escape them.
Don't search for heart-shaped rings on the internet. It leads you to a series of failed celebrity romances and presumably to a trail of tears: Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale, Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill.
As a design element, the heart is more like dots or stripes than it is a visual shorthand for romantic love. If you want romance, try lace or oysters or dead-stock midcentury Valentine's Day cards or inside jokes engraved on the back of a Swiss-made watch.
Hearts can feel bold and fresh: Think the boxy black Supreme shirt with red heart prints that Timothée Chalamet wore on a late-night talk show several years ago. (If that fact excites you, follow @readytimmywear on Instagram.) Another way to wear your heart on your sleeve would be a Nirvana "Heart-Shaped Box" allover print tee, recently going for four digits on Etsy.
To add just a little heart to your life, try a Deborah Pagani heart-shaped hair pin for Gucci Westman or a Blumarine belt with a heart-shaped buckle. Loewe has sunglasses with heart-shaped lenses, and like everything Jonathan Anderson designs, they're surreal enough that you can feel safe that no one will mistake you for paying homage to Kubrick's "Lolita." You might try to track down some of Chanel's chunkier costume jewelry with hearts. On the RealReal, you can find things like a red Chanel blouse with a black bow and a quilted heart from the Karl Lagerfeld years.
Even if you don't celebrate Valentine's Day, here are some hearts for the romantics and pragmatists alike.
Tiffany & Company
Hearts can lean a little bit cutesy, even skewing twee. If you'd rather die alone than give someone a candy heart, or are the kind of person who hates anything sweet (literal or figurative), try this jade pendant with an 18-karat gold mesh chain from the Elsa Peretti Open Heart collection for Tiffany. It's sexy and just a tad louche. The fresh green of the jade contrasts so well with the slinky 28-inch chain. Wear it with a beat-up vintage denim shirt buttoned so low even Bernard-Henri Lévy would blush. ( $ 4,900)
Alaïa
Remember when Rihanna wore that Yves Saint Laurent heart-shaped fur in 2016? Or maybe you bought the Erin Fetherston for Target heart-shaped bag in 2007? I was just doing some shopping reconnaissance and came across Alaïa's Le Cœur bag. It's small enough not to look gimmicky, but large enough to actually carry necessities. The shade of red is the right balance of cool and warm. Or you might consider a less obvious gold or blue one that comes on a gold chain. (from $ 1,170)
Yves Saint Laurent
No one understood the use of hearts as a design tool like Yves Saint Laurent, who drew them a little asymmetrical and off kilter. Re-See, the Paris-based designer resale site, has the best selection around, particularly the jewelry Robert Goossens designed for YSL. While you're browsing, there's a gold heart brooch with "Yves Saint Laurent" printed on it in script -- brooches are about to get big again -- that would look great on a man. But the coolest present would be a poster from 1989, said to be "from the private collection of one of Saint Laurent's most loyal collaborators." Bonus: It's framed. (2,100 euros, or about $ 2,300)
Stephen Dweck
Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country, who knows a lot about jewelry, said she was "a heart-jewelry skeptic for years" but is now drawn to them, pointing to lines like Foundrae and Briony Raymond. In that same vein, the jeweler Stephen Dweck, who used to design for Geoffrey Beene, makes the most decadent pair of earrings. You know when people ask you what your love language is? Here's mine: "Pink Tourmaline, Conch Shell and Diamond Earrings in 18K Gold." ( $ 28,865)
Paco Rabanne
A hood made of linked metal hearts looks like something you'd see in the armor section of the Met, but also like something the model Pat Cleveland would have worn to a club in the 1970s. (€650, or about $ 700)
Mondo Mondo
Hearts were big in the late 1980s, with bold, unapologetically big jewelry from Christian Lacroix or Chanel or Yves Saint Laurent. Natasha Ghosn, the designer of the Los Angeles jewelry-fragrance-candle line Mondo Mondo, may be the real heir to that aesthetic. So it's not surprising that she has a lot of heart motifs. This necklace looks like a piece of jewelry a scorned woman in a Jackie Collins novel would have ripped off her neck and thrown out a window after being betrayed by her man. It comes in silver and gold plate, but the silver feels a little less obvious and little more tender. ( $ 250)

At the Golden Globes, a Night of Statement-Making: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The awards show returned, and so did major dressing up.
So the Golden Globes returned, two years after disappearing from our screens, first because of a pandemic-induced lockdown and then because of scandal -- financial, ethical and racial. And with their disappearance went the first major red carpet of that phenomenon otherwise known as the Extended Awards Season Fashion Show.
Before the event, speculation was rife: Would stars actually show up for the tarnished Hollywood Foreign Press Association? And if they did, would they seek to play down their connection with the evening's awards by dressing down? Would they stay away from eye-catching ensembles, in favor of the forgettably banal and the bland?
As if. Globes night turned out to be a night of statement-making, onstage and on the red carpet. Not so much of the marketing or branding kind, but rather of the personal kind. And it was the more interesting for it.
Jerrod Carmichael, the host, set the tone with an opening monologue that addressed the Globes' historical lack of diversity without pulling any punches and went on from there -- with a matching set of six (count 'em) outfit changes that included two skinny black velvet suits (the first by Armani); a symphony of pinks; one white tuxedo with a sheer turtleneck and pearl necklace; and a Bode beaded tunic. It may be a record for number of award show looks worn by a single host. If some fashion brand doesn't sign him up immediately, it'll be the biggest surprise of the night.
Still, go big or go home seemed to be the general theme. Rihanna, making her first major post-baby event appearance, swaddled herself in a black velvet Schiaparelli bustier dress and an enormous shoulder-swallowing sculpted velvet stole, plus velvet opera gloves and Cartier diamonds.
Angela Bassett played a silver superhero in Pamela Rolland sequins. Laverne Cox channeled Marilyn Monroe in a blond bob and vintage Galliano gown. And Jessica Chastain got caught in a gossamer beaded Oscar de la Renta spiderweb -- with a matching mask. She was one of the few attendees to nod to the continued reality of Covid.
Royalty was a trend, represented in a plethora of red (Lily James in a bandeau top from which was suspended acres of swagged Versace skirting and Billy Porter in a cardinal velvet Christian Siriano coatdress with a sweeping train) and purple (Selena Gomez in Valentino and Sheryl Lee Ralph in glimmering Aliétte). This was probably not surprising given the recently unavoidable nature of the subject thanks to Prince Harry's memoir.
Also pink, courtesy of Seth Rogen in salmon Dior Men and Margot Robbie in powder puff Chanel. (Rumors of her separation from the brand appear to be highly exaggerated.) And overblown rosettes on lapels, as represented by Eddie Redmayne's chocolate Valentino, Diego Calva's forest green Gucci and Emma D'Arcy's oversize Acne Studios satin tux, skirt and trousers, chosen because, they said, "nothing says nonbinary like wearing both a skirt and trousers."
There was a lot of speaking-in-clothes going on. Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, in draped sapphire Balmain, told E! that her dress was "giving water butterfly." Michelle Williams, in cascading tiers of Gucci ruffles, looked like sea coral, wafting in the waves. And Jenny Slate, in leaf green Rodarte with a bloom at the throat, said she wanted to look "like a woman who's about to turn into a magical plant." Why not? It's the beginning of the year. Anything could happen.
Donald Glover said he was going for comfort, and the chance to get "mildly drunk," with his white silk YSL pajama-and-robe set under his tux, possibly the perfect combination of working-from-home dressing meets black tie. You can go from the ballroom to the bedroom in one easy step.
Indeed, it was but one of a variety of contemporary twists on ye olde tux, as modeled most successfully by Jean Smart in an elegant, sharp-shouldered tuxedo dress with an actual twist at the waist, and Hannah Einbinder in a strapless black Carolina Herrera tea dress with a white bow at the bodice.
She looked as if she could move, as did Letitia Wright, in a simple Prada trompe l'oeil silk column dress, deliberately crumpled and splotched with a rough-cut slash at the leg that was an ode of sorts to the elegance of imperfection. Like the night itself, it was a reminder that when it comes to our flaws, it's how you deal with them that matters.

Cool People, Awful Trends and a Few Predictions: [Style Desk]

Full text: Hosts of the cult podcast "Throwing Fits" gathered with friends and fans to weigh in on fashion and who's the coolest person in Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES -- The "Throwing Fits" holiday party, toasting the popular podcast that ridicules and reveres men's fashion equally, began just after 5 p.m. last Thursday, when Lawrence Schlossman and James Harris, the hosts of the show, stepped out of a car in front of Mohawk General Store in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. They cradled packs of Budweiser and Modelo like infants they had rescued from a gas station.
Guests dressed in baggy work-wear pants, chic but fraying shirts, limited-edition sneakers and nubby fleeces. Many were regulars of the store or avid listeners of the podcast. Inside, there was a table with wine, liquor and CBD beverages.
Slowly the crowd ballooned and spilled outside the shop, a popular boutique owned by the husband-and-wife team Kevin and Bo Carney. Its stock list -- Our Legacy, Dries Van Noten, Stüssy, Bode -- is the sort that a listener of "Throwing Fits" would find appealing.
This is the second year that Mr. Harris and Mr. Schlossman have held the party, and has been a chance for them to create a real-world meet-up for their internet friends. All were welcome.
"I think anytime you have an online internet friendship and then you actually meet the person and you both realize that you're not weirdos, you realize that connection is real," Mr. Harris said.
We asked some of the attendees for their thoughts on the coolest person in Los Angeles, the worst trends of the year, and their predictions for the coming one. Here's what we heard. Interviews have been edited.
Lawrence Schlossman, 35, and James Harris, 36
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
Mr. Harris: Kevin from Mohawk. The work speaks for itself. He does so many out there projects and executes them in a sick, tasteful way. The man decided to just launch a wine brand, called Loose Wines, and now the juice is loose.
Mr. Schlossman: I'm gonna say Nick Dierl. He's the most connected man in Los Angeles; he's the mayor. Every good restaurant, he has the batline. Whether it's Horses or Jitlada, he's the guy who'll get you the res with a moment's notice. What shows coolness like getting a reservation on a dime?
What will be the unexpected trend of 2023?
Mr. Schlossman: Leather for me. Pants, shirts, jackets. It never really went away. I'm just really drawn to that stuff. I just love the idea of a dude in leather.
Mr. Harris: I think it'll be casual grills. Nothing serious. Nothing too heavy, keep the hardware light. Maybe it's a one-piece or a two-piece.
Kevin Carney, 53
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
Donald Glover. I think he's an amazing all-around Renaissance man. He does so many things so well. I look up to him for that. Style, cinema, writing, dialogue, everything he does.
Do you have any resolutions?
I want to work more with my hands. I want to garden more. Getting dirty with my hands gives me so much pleasure and, at the end of the day, if I'm covered in dirt I've had a better day than if I'm wearing some cool outfit.
Jimmy Alexander, 36
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
My therapist. He's a great listener. That's part of being cool, being a good listener.
What's a trend that you want to see die with the end of the year?
I can say what I hope, which is safety and cynicism is a trend I'd like to see go. In fashion or design -- I'd like to see more vulnerable stuff. I'd love to see less logos and more individuality and biographical stuff. That's what I'm trying to do, not just a mood board but to tell a story. That's why I love Margiela. You didn't know who he was but, through his work, you knew who he was.
What was the worst outfit you saw this year?
At Paris Fashion Week I met Angus McCloud, who seemed very nice. But he was literally wearing a piece from each luxury house. Like, on his hat he had two bandannas, one being Chanel the other being Louis Vuitton, and then the hat was, like, Dior.
Cody Pham, 27
What's a trend for 2022 that's got to go?
I'm really upset about the parachute pants thing. Because a lot of people put on a big pant and a small shirt and some sneakers and they think they're dressing. I'm not really big on that whole thing right now.
What trends are you excited about for 2023?
I'm actually really liking some of this strange Y2K stuff coming back. Obviously, it's been pretty heavy the last couple of years. But the continuation of the Jean Paul Gaultier, that kind of look and feel. And the old trainers from back then, getting rid of the whole chunky sneaker look. I've always liked an oversized pant with a slim shoe. I like seeing the Vans Half Cab making a comeback.
Do you have any style resolutions for next year?
I think I need to stop shopping but in general, my resolution is to only buy clothes made by my friends.
Marco Martinez, 29
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
Twin Shadow. He's a musical artist who rides motorcycles. I love his music, and I got into motorcycles a few years ago. And I've actually met him, and he's really down-to-earth. Seeing that he was into motorcycles gave me permission to follow my passion with that. I love his personal style, and his live shows are some of the best. And then to have met him and he's this person you look up to and he's down to have a conversation and connect about the things you like is amazing.
What do you think people will be into next year?
I want people to keep appreciating vintage. Vintage is the canvas that a lot of designer pieces come from. It's sustainable, it's easy to acquire.
Do you have any style resolutions for next year?
I just want to buy one piece per season. Just four pieces. This year introduced me to a state of contentment. I'm very content with my wardrobe. And focusing on one piece per season will make me really intentional and buy something I really like.
Gil Campos, 24
What will be a trend in 2023?
I hope that consumers are smarter with what they buy. Companies like Shein are growing in popularity, but at the same time, with Gen Z coming up, they're also becoming more attentive in terms of what they buy.
What's a trend from this year you want to be done with?
Fake angst. It just leads to a pretentious vibe.
Do you have any style resolutions for 2023?
To stop buying shoes. I have like 10, but in reality, I only wear three of four.
Jon Alan, 31
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
Well, the real answer is my girlfriend because she's the best communicator. But the cool answer would be that guy Edgy Albert. He's big on TikTok, he's a men's wear guy. He's very cool, and he's very sincere and very much a real person.
What's a trend from this year you want to be done?
Live podcast tapings where you buy tickets to go see a recording. It's just really weird. Like, you've kind of paid money to go eavesdrop on a conversation.
Do you have any style resolutions for yourself for next year?
No, I'm pretty happy with where I'm at right now. I'm happy with how little I've been spending money and how much versatility I've been getting out of my wardrobe. That's always a big thing for me -- versatility. I guess that's the main style resolution for me: continuing the pursuit of versatility and keeping it as light as possible.
Karl Charles, 25
Who's the coolest person in Los Angeles?
I'm honestly still looking for him. He hasn't revealed himself yet. I mean, it could be anyone, I take fashion inspiration from my homie who works up the street at the florist shop. My roommate, Drok -- I take inspiration from him, and he takes it from me. It's a feedback loop.
What's a trend you think will be big next year?
I love the way that denim is coming back. I love people getting into cuts and fits and silhouettes.
What trend do you want to die with 2022?
I really want logos to end. Any type of embroidery work or block-printing, or dyeing -- let's do that. I don't need someone signaling to me where they bought something.
Do you have any style resolutions for next year?
Just to keep learning and fill in the gaps in my wardrobe. Like, if denim is going to be big next year, then accessory items for denim will be bigger, like key chains or T-shirts, or boots. Just building that world.
