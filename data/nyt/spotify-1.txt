LOS ANGELES — A year ago, Hollywood’s creative community was celebrating the apparent decline of corporate, paint-by-numbers sequels and remakes. Blockbuster ticket sales for movies such as “Oppenheimer,” “Sound of Freedom” and “Barbie” had shown — or so it seemed — that audiences were finally hungry for fresh stories.
You could almost hear the relief emanating from franchise-fatigued writers, directors and producers. “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the wildly inventive Oscar-winning art film that broke out in cinemas in 2022, had not been a fluke!
Alas. Mass moviegoing swung squarely back to the predictable this past year, with sequels filling nine of the top 10 slots at the North American box office. The ennead consisted of “Inside Out 2,” “Despicable Me 4,” “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Moana 2,” “Dune: Part Two,” “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” “Kung Fu Panda 4,” “Twisters” and the 38th Godzilla movie, “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.”
“Wicked,” a song-by-song adaptation of the first half of the long-running Broadway musical, was the only top-10 outlier, counting as original, if only by a witchy whisker. (In the alternative reality of Hollywood, a movie can be “original” even if it is derivative of something else. What matters is whether the source material has previously been used for a stand-alone theatrical movie.)
Those hit franchise movies and others — the fourth chapter in the “Bad Boys” series, the 10th “Planet of the Apes” installment, “Gladiator II” — drove ticket sales in the United States and Canada to an estimated $8.75 billion for the year, according to Comscore. Theater owners are thrilled: Despite a shortage of major movies in the first half of the year — a result of two union strikes — 2024 ticket sales are expected to fall only 3% from 2023.
Higher ticket prices propped up the 2024 total, analysts said.
Over the weekend, “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” was the No. 1 box office draw. The sequel to a sequel collected about $38 million for a two-week domestic total of $138 million. The big-budget prequel “Mufasa: The Lion King” was a close second with $37 million, lifting its domestic total to $113 million. “Nosferatu,” a horror remake, took in $21 million for a sturdy $40 million since arriving on Christmas Day.
“We feel very good, which is not something many of us would have said last year at this time,” said Michael O’Leary, CEO of the National Association of Theater Owners, which represents 33,000 movie screens in the United States. About 76% of Americans ages 12 to 74 put down their phones long enough to attend at least one movie in theaters in the past year, O’Leary said, citing a recent National Research Group study.
“And we’re excited about what is coming,” he added.
In 2025, studios will parade out “Superman,” “Karate Kid: Legends,” “Jurassic World Rebirth,” a live-action “Lilo & Stitch,” “Freakier Friday,” “The Naked Gun,” “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning” and at least 33 other major franchise sequels, reboots and remakes.
Hollywood has not given up on originality. Sony Pictures released a handful of originals in 2024 and found a hit in the drama “It Ends With Us,” which took in $149 million in North America. DreamWorks Animation was encouraged by the $143 million in domestic ticket sales that “The Wild Robot” achieved in the fall.
In the months ahead, Warner Bros. will notably release original films from Ryan Coogler (“Sinners,” being marketed as “a new vision of fear”), Paul Thomas Anderson (a still-untitled crime thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio), Bong Joon Ho (“Mickey 17”) and Joseph Kosinski (“F1,” a big-budget racing movie).
The problem is that Americans tend to say one thing and do another: They complain that Hollywood does not make enough original films, only to stay home or go elsewhere when studios call their bluff. Over the past year, the moviegoing masses rejected originals like “Here,” “Fly Me to the Moon,” “Argylle,” “Horizon: An American Saga,” “Harold and the Purple Crayon,” “Lisa Frankenstein,” “Y2K” and “Megalopolis.”
To be fair, all of those films received soft-to-poor reviews, diminishing their appeal. More than ever, moviegoers want insurance: Is this activity going to be worth my time and money?
Ticket prices have increased. Throw in the cost of popcorn, parking and a babysitter and — yikes, maybe let’s not take the chance on an original movie: Two tickets for “Sonic 3,” please. We at least had fun at the second one. We know what we’re getting.
For the most part, however, originals with terrific reviews did not break out, either.
“Saturday Night,” “A Real Pain,” “Challengers,” “Conclave,” “Thelma,” “The Apprentice,” “Anora,” “My Old Ass” and “The Substance” — each championed by critics, each available in at least 1,000 theaters — took in a combined $147 million in North America. “Civil War” and “Longlegs” were indie hits, but neither grossed anywhere near the $100 million mark.
To compare, “Inside Out 2” collected $653 million by itself.
In May, Universal released “The Fall Guy,” a well-reviewed action comedy that cost at least $200 million to make and market. It was the first time in 19 years that Hollywood’s all-important summer season did not start with a superhero or a sequel. “The Fall Guy” shared a name and some basic DNA with a television drama that ran on ABC from 1981 to 1986. But the movie’s story was entirely new.
Ker-thud: Opening-weekend ticket sales added up to $28 million in North America, the worst start to the season since 1995.

Video Games Can't Afford to Look So Good: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The gaming industry spent billions pursuing the idea that customers wanted realistic graphics. Did executives misread the market?
One way to understand the video game industry's current crisis is by looking closely at Spider-Man's spandex.
For decades, companies like Sony and Microsoft have bet that realistic graphics were the key to attracting bigger audiences. By investing in technology, they have elevated flat pixelated worlds into experiences that often feel like stepping into a movie.
Designers of last year's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 used the processing power of the PlayStation 5 so Peter Parker's outfits would be rendered with realistic textures and skyscraper windows could reflect rays of sunlight.
That level of detail did not come cheap.
Insomniac Games, which is owned by Sony, spent about $ 300 million to develop Spider-Man 2, according to leaked documents, more than triple the budget of the first game in the series, which was released five years earlier. Chasing Hollywood realism requires Hollywood budgets, and even though Spider-Man 2 sold more than 11 million copies, several members of Insomniac lost their jobs when Sony announced 900 layoffs in February.
Cinematic games are getting so expensive and time-consuming to make that the video game industry has started to acknowledge that investing in graphics is providing diminished financial returns.
"It's very clear that high-fidelity visuals are only moving the needle for a vocal class of gamers in their 40s and 50s," said Jacob Navok, a former executive at Square Enix who left that studio, known for the Final Fantasy series, in 2016 to start his own media company. "But what does my 7-year-old son play? Minecraft. Roblox. Fortnite."
Joost van Dreunen, a market analyst and professor at New York University, said it was clear what younger generations value in their video games: "Playing is an excuse for hanging out with other people."
When millions are happy to play old games with outdated graphics -- including Roblox (2006), Minecraft (2009) and Fortnite (2017) -- it creates challenges for studios that make blockbuster single-player titles. The industry's audience has slightly shrunk for the first time in decades. Studios are rapidly closing and sweeping layoffs have affected more than 20,000 employees in the past two years, including more than 2,500 Microsoft workers.
Many video game developers built their careers during an era that glorified graphical fidelity. They marveled at a scene from The Last of Us: Part II in which Ellie, the protagonist, removes a shirt over her head to reveal bruises and scrapes on her back without any technical glitches.
But a few years later, costly graphical upgrades are often barely noticeable.
When the studio Naughty Dog released a remastered version of The Last of Us: Part II this year, light bounced off lakes and puddles with a more realistic shimmer. In a November ad for the PlayStation 5 Pro, an enhanced version of the Sony console that retails for almost $ 700, the billboards in Spider-Man 2's Manhattan featured crisper letters.
Optimizing cinematic games for a narrow group of consumers who have spent hundreds of dollars on a console or computer may no longer make financial sense. Studios are increasingly prioritizing games with basic graphics that can be played on the smartphones already in everyone's pocket.
"They essentially run on toasters," said Matthew Ball, an entrepreneur and video game analyst, talking about games like Roblox and League of Legends. "The developers aren't chasing graphics but the social connections that players have built over time."
Going Hollywood
Developers had long taught players to equate realism with excellence, but this new toaster generation of gamers is upsetting industry orthodoxies. The developer behind Animal Well, which received extensive praise this year, said the game's file size was smaller than many of the screenshots used to promote it.
A company like Nintendo was once the exception that proved the rule, telling its audiences over the past 40 years that graphics were not a priority.
That strategy had shown weaknesses through the 1990s and 2000s, when the Nintendo 64 and GameCube had weaker visuals and sold fewer copies than Sony consoles. But now the tables have turned. Industry figures joke about how a cartoony game like Luigi's Mansion 3 on the Nintendo Switch considerably outsells gorgeous cinematic narratives on the PlayStation 5 like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.
There are a number of theories why gamers have turned their backs on realism. One hypothesis is that players got tired of seeing the same artistic style in major releases. Others speculate that cinematic graphics require so much time and money to develop that gameplay suffers, leaving customers with a hollow experience.
Another theory is that major studios have spent recent years reshaping themselves in Hollywood's image, pursuing crossover deals that have given audiences "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" and "The Last of Us" on HBO. Not only have companies like Ubisoft opened divisions to produce films, but their games include an astonishing amount of scenes where players watch the story unfold.
In 2007, the first Assassin's Creed provided more than 2.5 hours of footage for a fan edit of the game's narrative. As the series progressed, so did Ubisoft's taste for cinema. Like many studios, it increasingly leaned on motion-capture animators who could create scenes using human actors on soundstages. A fan edit of Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, which was released in 2020, lasted about 23 hours -- longer than two seasons of "Game of Thrones."
Gamers and journalists began talking about how the franchise's entries had gotten too bloated and expensive. Ubisoft developers advertised last year's Assassin's Creed Mirage, which had about five hours of cut scenes, as "more intimate."
The immersive graphics of virtual reality can also be prohibitive for gamers; the Meta Quest Pro sells for $ 1,000 and the Apple Vision Pro for $ 3,500. This year, the chief executive of Ubisoft, Yves Guillemot, told the company's investors that because the virtual reality version of Assassin's Creed did not meet sales expectations, the company was not increasing its investment in the technology.
Many studios have instead turned to the live service model, where graphics are less important than a regular drip of new content that keeps players engaged. Genshin Impact, by the studio Hoyoverse, makes roughly $ 2 billion every year on mobile platforms alone, according to the data tracker Sensor Tower.
Going Broke?
It was clear this year, however, that the live service strategy carries its own risks. Warner Bros. Discovery took a $ 200 million loss on Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, according to Bloomberg. Sony closed the studio behind Concord, its attempt to compete with team-based shooters like Overwatch and Apex Legends, one month after the game released to a minuscule player base.
"We have a market that has been in growth mode for decades," Ball said. "Now we are in a mature market where instead of making bets on growth, companies need to try and steal shares from each other."
Some industry professionals believe there is a path for superb-looking games to survive the cost crunch.
"I used to be a high-fidelity guy; I would log into games and if it didn't look hyperrealistic, then it was not so interesting," said David Reitman, a managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he leads the consulting firm's games division. "There was a race to hyperrealism, and it's tough to pivot away. You have set expectations."
Reitman sees a future where most of the heavy costs associated with cutting-edge graphics are handled by artificial intelligence. He said that manufacturers were working on creating A.I. chips for consoles that would facilitate those changes, and that some game studios were already using smart algorithms to improve graphics further than anything previously seen.
He expects that sports games will be the first genre to see considerable improvements because developers have access to hundreds of hours of game footage. "They can take feeds from leagues and transpose them into graphical renderings," Reitman said, "leveraging language models to generate the incremental movements and facial expressions of players."
Some independent developers are less convinced. "The idea that there will be content from A.I. before we figure out how it works and where it will source data from is really hard," said Rami Ismail, a game developer in the Netherlands.
Ismail is worried that major studios are in a tight spot where traditional games have become too expensive but live service games have become too risky. He pointed to recent games that had both jaw-dropping realism -- Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora (individual pebbles of gravel cast shadows) and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (rays of sunlight flicker through the trees) -- and lackluster sales.
He recalled a question that emerged early in the coronavirus pandemic and has become something of an unofficial motto in the video game industry.
"How can we as an industry make shorter games with worse graphics made with people who are paid well to work less?" Ismail said.
"If we can, then there might be short-term hope," he continued. "Otherwise I think the slow strangulation of the games industry is ongoing."

Full text: Listen to selections from recordings of a new John Adams opera, Chopin études by Yunchan Lim, Brahms works by Igor Levit and more.
John Adams: 'Girls of the Golden West'
Los Angeles Philharmonic; John Adams, conductor (Nonesuch)
John Adams and Peter Sellars's "Girls of the Golden West" has struggled to catch on since its premiere, but this recording makes the best case yet for its vitality. With nearly an hour of cuts and a treatment of Americana both vivid and terrifying, it's essential listening for the opera's doubters. JOSHUA BARONE
'Aigul'
Aigul Akhmetshina, mezzo-soprano; Royal Philharmonic Orchestra; Daniele Rustioni, conductor (Decca)
In a year that hasn't offered up many opera-star recitals that are glossy and worthwhile, Aigul Akhmetshina's self-titled debut is the exception. It shows off her luscious timbre, serpentine legato, and nuanced artistry in a wide range of repertoire that is both suitable and surprising. OUSSAMA ZAHR
'American Counterpoints'
Curtis Stewart, violin; Experiential Orchestra; James Blachly, conductor (Bright Shiny Things)
Julia Perry, who would have turned 100 this year, achieved recognition during her lifetime but fell into obscurity after her death, in 1979. Her brooding Violin Concerto, written in the 1960s, is a fine example of the sober yet seething angularity of its era, leavened with warm strings and hints of Coplandesque expansiveness. ZACHARY WOOLFE
Timo Andres: 'The Blind Banister'
Timo Andres, piano; Metropolis Ensemble; Andrew Cyr, conductor (Nonesuch)
Timo Andres's piano concerto "The Blind Banister," a 2016 finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, is structured in three movements but behaves like a single, grand gesture of descending scales and fascinating harmony. Threaded throughout is the solo part, played by the composer with wit and tender lyricism. JOSHUA BARONE
Brahms: Piano Concertos & Solo Piano
Igor Levit, piano; Vienna Philharmonic; Christian Thielemann, conductor (Sony Classical)
Sure, plenty of pianists can supply muscle and power in the Brahms concertos, which they surely need. But precious few can balance that side with the finesse and acuity that Igor Levit marshals here, paired with the Vienna Philharmonic in gloriously sensitive form. His playing in the solo works is commanding in its understatement. DAVID WEININGER
'Brahms and Schubert'
Alexandre Kantorow, piano (Bis)
On this galvanizing recording, Alexandre Kantorow, the winner of the 2019 International Tchaikovsky Competition, brings darkly toned intensity to two virtuosic cornerstones of Romantic piano music, Brahms's Piano Sonata No. 1 and Schubert's "Wanderer Fantasy," complemented by exquisitely poetic readings of Schubert Lieder transcribed by Liszt. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM
Bruckner: Symphony No. 7
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; Manfred Honeck, conductor (Reference)
Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra continue their remarkable run of recordings with this excellent tribute to Bruckner in the composer's 200th anniversary year. Honeck's reading is as creative as you might expect, but it is the astonishing quality of orchestral playing that makes this release downright extraordinary. DAVID ALLEN
Chopin: Études, Opp. 10 & 25
Yunchan Lim, piano (Decca)
Since bursting onto the scene a mere two years ago, Yunchan Lim has established himself as a pianist of preternatural calm and eloquence. It's no surprise to find him in total command on this recording, balancing note-by-note clarity with long-phrase lyricism amid Chopin's staggering technical demands. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Continuum'
Vikingur Olafsson, piano (Deutsche Grammophon)
Shortly after concluding a world tour of the "Goldberg" Variations, Vikingur Olafsson released this gem, a set of six Bach arrangements -- four of them his own -- that is barely 20 minutes long. If some of the playing edges past meditative toward precious, Olafsson makes Harold Bauer's version of "Komm, Süsser Tod" into a marvel, dignified and steadfast. DAVID ALLEN
'Debussy, Attahir, Ravel'
Quatuor Arod (Erato)
In a sea of excellent string quartets, the young French ensemble Quatuor Arod makes a splash with gripping readings of the Debussy and Ravel quartets that find fluency in the finicky textures. Benjamin Attahir's "Al' Asr," part of a cycle inspired by Muslim prayer, leaps off the page with breathy vigor and emotional cohesion. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM
Duruflé: Requiem & Poulenc: Lenten Motets
Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge; Stephen Layton, conductor (Hyperion)
Everything about this recording is intoxicating: the Choir of Trinity College's dreamy sound; the setting's enveloping church acoustic; the weightlessness of the organ-only version of Duruflé's beloved Requiem. The conductor Stephen Layton achieves heavenly swells that push the choir's plushness to ever greater volumes, and Harrison Cole's organ playing floats by, untethered by earthly matters. OUSSAMA ZAHR
'Julius Eastman, Vol. 4: The Holy Presence'
Wild Up (New Amsterdam)
There may have been no harder hitting one-two punch in music this year than Julius Eastman's "Prelude to the Holy Presence of Joan d'Arc," a harrowing solo vocal work performed by Davóne Tines, followed by Eastman's "The Holy Presence of Joan D'Arc" for 10 cellos, heroically multitracked by Seth Parker Woods. A high point in Wild Up's essential Eastman series. DAVID WEININGER
Elgar: Violin Concerto
Vilde Frang, violin; Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Robin Ticciati, conductor (Warner Classics)
There are already many fine recordings of Elgar's Violin Concerto, but the work contains such depths that there is always room for one more. This is a good one, too: Backed by a sympathetic orchestra, the violinist Vilde Frang's technical security and emotional sensitivity generate unusual intensity. DAVID ALLEN
'Forgotten Sounds'
(Delos)
Sometimes the search for new music leads into the past, as in this premiere recording of Charles Martin Loeffler's recently rediscovered Octet for two clarinets, harp, string quartet and bass. Loeffler, the German-born assistant concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, wrote the work in 1897. It's a heady blend of Impressionist color, Brahmsian lyricism and foamy, shifting textures. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM
Handel: 'Alcina'
Les Musiciens du Louvre; Marc Minkowski, conductor (Pentatone)
The four female leads are elegant and articulate in this recording of Handel's masterpiece of love and illusion. But this "Alcina" is defined by Marc Minkowski and Les Musiciens du Louvre, their playing hearty, even rambunctious. While there are more refined versions, this one has an infectious vitality. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Keel Road'
Danish String Quartet (ECM)
The Danish String Quartet continues to do no wrong in this, its third recording of folk music. The pain and the promise of the concluding song, "Nar Mitt Oye, Trett Av Moye" ("When My Eyes, Sore With Weeping"), are sometimes enough to reduce me to a blubbering wreck. I played nothing else so often all year. DAVID ALLEN
Antonin Kraft & Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: Cello Concertos
Jean-Guihen Queyras, cello; Ensemble Resonanz; Riccardo Minasi, conductor (Harmonia Mundi)
Antonin Kraft (1749-1820) was a notable cellist of his time, and an occasional composer. His Concerto in C for his instrument was written around the turn of the 19th century, but harks back to the style of a few decades earlier without any staleness, its dashing good cheer captured on this irresistible recording. ZACHARY WOOLFE
Mozart: Requiem
Ensemble Pygmalion; Raphaël Pichon, conductor (Harmonia Mundi)
Mozart famously left his Requiem unfinished, and the conductor Raphaël Pichon has reimagined what it means to complete it. With a canny ear for color and key relationships, Pichon uses other Mozart pieces to enlarge the Requiem's touchingly dark world without distorting it. A vein of gentleness runs through this version, and the soprano Ying Fang is particularly ravishing. OUSSAMA ZAHR
'Music in Time of War'
Ruzan Mantashyan, soprano; Kirill Gerstein, piano (Platoon)
This year, no album was as ambitious and intelligent as "Music in Time of War," a imagined conversation between Claude Debussy and Komitas Vardapet, witnesses to 20th-century horrors. The recording's physical edition includes a book of essays and photography, but the highlight is the often revelatory music, not least Komitas's achingly beautiful folk songs. JOSHUA BARONE
Gabriela Ortiz: 'Revolución Diamantina'
María Dueñas, violin; Los Angeles Philharmonic; Gustavo Dudamel, conductor (Platoon)
This Gabriela Ortiz triptych is irresistible from the start: the jaggedly fiery violin solo that opens "Altar de Cuerda," one of the finest and most exhilarating violin concertos of the past decade. The young violinist María Dueñas, having stunned in the classic repertoire, is here planting her flag in the music of today. JOSHUA BARONE
Rameau: Pièces de Clavecin
Janne Valkeajoki, accordion (Orchid Music)
The accordion was more than a half-century from invention when Rameau died, but with this album, the accordionist Janne Valkeajoki has made a persuasive case for how naturally, and how beautifully, Rameau's keyboard works can translate to the alternatively intimate and symphonic character of his instrument. JOSHUA BARONE
'Maya Beiser x Terry Riley: In C'
Maya Beiser, cello (Islandia Music)
Performances of Terry Riley's crusading minimalist work "In C" can feel like barely regulated chaos. The adventurous cellist Maya Beiser reimagines the piece as a careful assemblage of multitracked loops weaving in and out of proximity with one another. A fresh and revelatory take on a six-decade-old magnum opus. DAVID WEININGER
'Rose in Bloom'
Erin Morley, soprano; Gerald Martin Moore, piano (Orchid Music)
For coloratura sopranos, pristine singing, with its connotations of perfection and sterility, is an entry-level requirement, but Erin Morley suffuses her shimmery tone with heart and a real point of view. With spinning high notes and exquisite filigree, her singing is emotionally insightful without sacrificing its luminous finish. OUSSAMA ZAHR
Saariaho: 'Adriana Mater'
San Francisco Symphony; San Francisco Symphony Chorus; Esa-Pekka Salonen, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon)
Set against a backdrop of war, Kaija Saariaho's second opera revolves around themes of violence and compassion. Its redemptive ending might seem odd were it not for her exquisite and elusive score. Taped just days after her death last year, this recording serves as a fitting memorial to a composer of singular vision. DAVID WEININGER
'Wonder Women'
L'Arpeggiata; Christina Pluhar, music director (Erato)
Witches, nuns and grieving mothers people this delightfully gender-porous album that places works by Baroque women composers alongside beguiling arrangements of folk ballads from Latin America and Italy. Four classically trained soloists trade places, artfully slipping into rough-tongued immediacy in popular songs as in the Chilean-Swedish mezzo Luciana Mancini's fierce take on "La Llorona." CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM

Comedy
'Roy Wood Jr.'s Year-End Reflections'
Dec. 29 at 7 p.m. at the Second City New York, 64 North Ninth Street, Brooklyn; secondcity.com/new-york.
Since leaving "The Daily Show" last year, Roy Wood Jr. has found a comfy new home skewering headlines every Saturday on CNN's comedy panel series "Have I Got News for You," which has been renewed for a second season. And he will greet 2025 with his fourth stand-up special, and first for Hulu, "Lonely Flowers," which premieres on Jan. 17.
But to close the books on this year, the comedian and actor, who hosted the 2023 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner and starred alongside Jon Hamm in the 2022 film "Confess, Fletch," will corral those among his funny friends who have stayed in the city for the holidays. To find out whom he manages to round up, you'll have to show up for this night of jokes and stories.
Tickets are $ 20 at Second City's website. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Florry
Dec. 28 at 8 p.m. at Baby's All Right, 146 Broadway, Brooklyn; babysallright.com.
Philadelphia has long boasted a reputation as a breeding ground for indie bands. Florry is one such outfit -- though its sound feels as grounded in the rural upbringing of its bandleader, Francie Medosch, as it does in the rock-forward D.I.Y. scene of the city she now calls home. The country influences that bubbled up on the band's 2021 album, "Big Fall," fully envelop its follow-up from last year, "The Holey Bible," which features heaps of fiddle, lap steel, full-band bonhomie and guitar grooves deep as tire tracks on a muddy road.
Florry will bring its convivial spirit to the early show at Baby's All Right on Saturday, with opening sets from the indie-rock quartet Robber Robber and its drummer, who is performing solo as Dari Bay. Tickets are $ 20 (with discounts for purchases of two or four packs) on SeeTickets. OLIVIA HORN
The 8-Bit Big Band
Dec. 27 at 7:30 and 10 p.m. at Sony Hall, 235 West 46th Street, Manhattan; sonyhall.com.
Like Super Mario powered up by an invincibility star, the big band continues to surge forward no matter the challenges the world throws its way.
The large jazz ensembles that thrive today tend to be specialized, keeping alive the spirit of Charles Mingus, Roy Hargrove or Sun Ra, or they present bold new work from leader-composers like Darcy James Argue or Jihye Lee. With its Nintendo 64 ethos, the 8-Bit Big Band, headed by Charlie Rosen, is no less ambitious or forward-thinking. Over four albums that have earned two Grammy nominations, Rosen's crack ensemble has contributed hard swing, fusion funk, quicksilver arrangements and a slick symphonic sheen to what Rosen has called the "great video game songbook," a canon he is helping create on the fly. While the repertoire includes classic Zelda, Mario and Sonic themes, don't expect MIDI simplicity or rote nostalgia: The band's sophisticated treatment of video game songs like "The Last Surprise" from Persona 5 or "Still Alive" from Portal burst with vigor, vision and joy.
The 7:30 p.m. performance is sold out, but a standby line will form at the box office before showtime. Standing-room and V.I.P. tickets remain for the 10 o'clock set; they start at $ 35 on Sony Hall's website. ALAN SCHERSTUHL

Hanukkah Menorah Lighting & Celebration
Dec. 29, 3-5 p.m., at the Seaport, Heineken Riverdeck at Pier 17, 89 South Street, Manhattan; theseaport.nyc.
According to Jewish tradition, Hanukkah commemorates an ancient miracle: More than 2,000 years ago, when the Jewish Maccabees rededicated the temple in Jerusalem after defeating the Syrian-Greek occupiers, they found only enough oil to burn for one day. But the supply lasted for eight, inspiring the eight-day festival.
On Sunday, Hanukkah's fifth day, the Seaport will host a free celebration with an amazing feat of its own: The organization Chabad FiDi will light a six-foot-tall chocolate menorah that will not dissolve into a puddle. Through careful engineering of the candle holders -- and help from the winter cold -- the menorah will blaze without melting.
The festivities will also include plenty of chocolate to eat, along with popcorn, doughnuts, latkes and more holiday treats. Children can make chocolate crafts as well as other Hanukkah-themed art, have their faces painted and enjoy songs performed by young students from FiDi Hebrew School. (An online R.S.V.P. is recommended.)
Bowne & Company Stationers, which is part of the South Street Seaport Museum, will present an activity on the pier, too: Young visitors can stamp individual wooden dreidels with Hebrew letters made of heated gold foil. The drop-in workshop and materials are free; online registration is encouraged. LAUREL GRAEBER
Dance
Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater
Through Jan. 5 at New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; nycitycenter.org.
Move over, nutcrackers and sugar plum fairies. One of New York's great holiday dance traditions is the seasonal showcase of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, a banquet of classic and new works by several generations of acclaimed choreographers, which this year include a few Ailey alumni.
The "All New" program (Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m.) features "Al-Andalus Blues," created by Jamar Roberts and set to songs by Roberta Flack and Miles Davis; and the former Ailey dancer and interim director Matthew Rushing's "Sacred Songs," which repurposes music no longer used in the company staple "Revelations" (a piece that appears on several lineups throughout this run). Other highlights in the coming week are "Finding Free" by Hope Boykin (Saturday at 2 p.m.) and a revival of Elisa Monte's work "Treading" (Sunday at 7 p.m. and New Year's Eve at 2 p.m.).
Tickets start at $ 32 on City Center's website. For added context, you can pair a show with a visit to the Whitney Museum's impressive, illuminating "Edges of Ailey" exhibition, which runs through Feb. 9. BRIAN SCHAEFER

It's 1936, and This Populist Plutocrat Shames the Elites: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Author: Hoberman, J

Publication info: Hoberman, J. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/1936-this-populist-plutocrat-shames-elites/docview/3149333997/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This 1936 comedy, starring Gary Cooper and showing for a week at Film Forum, turns the tables on the period's metropolitan melodramas.
Around the dawn of the New Deal, a naïve bumpkin inherits a cool $ 20 million (nearly half a billion dollars today) from a hitherto unknown relative. He is harassed by big-city swindlers and ridiculed by supercilious sophisticates. Then, confronted by a starving would-be assassin (one of the Depression's archetypal "forgotten men"), he decides to give his fortune to the unemployed and is pilloried by the establishment for his "insane desire to become a public benefactor."
Such is the arc of Frank Capra's 1936 comedy "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," starring Gary Cooper as Longfellow Deeds, a greeting-card poet from the fictional town of Mandrake Falls, Vt. Showing from Dec. 27 to Jan. 2 at Film Forum, the movie is vintage Americana. An unscarred 35-millimeter print adds to the old timey feel, but there are ways in which "Deeds" feels as fresh as the rhetoric in last month's presidential election.
Closer to political cartoon than allegory, "Deeds" opens with a dramatic crash and promptly establishes a dichotomy between slick lawyers and small-town innocents. That dynamic only intensifies once Deeds, the newly minted multimillionaire, comes to the attention of New York's sneering cultural elite and cynical press -- mocked as a "cornfed bohunk," and then, thanks to the wily reporter Babe Bennett (Jean Arthur), cast in the press as the clueless "Cinderella Man."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Just as Capra's previous film "It Happened One Night" (1934) marked the end of the anarchic comedies of the early 1930s, so "Deeds" turns the tables on the period's hard-boiled word-slinging metropolitan melodramas. The plain-spoken Deeds towers above the wiseguys. Pauline Kael would blame Capra for neutering the rakish young Cooper of "Morocco" (1930), but "Deeds" paved the way for the implacable integrity Cooper would personify in later movies like "The Fountainhead" (1949) and "High Noon" (1952).
Although the New York Times critic Frank S. Nugent took "Deeds" as little more than a "shrewd and lively comedy," others saw a message. Capra may have voted Republican, but his movie -- which opened seven months before the 1936 presidential election -- was widely taken for New Deal or even socialist propaganda.
Rather than left-wing fantasy, however, "Deeds" is a populist myth. We know that Babe has a heart once she reveals that she is also from a small town and understands that Deeds speaks the language of the people when he uses the vernacular term "doodler," as in one who draws doodles, and is obliged to define it for the New York swells. (The word did not appear in The New York Times until the mid-1950s.)
Deeds may quote Thoreau, compose sappy Mothers's Day cards, play tuba in an amateur band and shed a patriotic tear at Grant's Tomb, but, quick with his fists, he is a real guy. The San Antonio chapter of Cooper's fan club was onto something when, inspired by "Deeds," they organized a campaign to elect their hero president. Decades later, Ronald Reagan would use the movie to defend "volunteerism." The country-boy billionaire Ross Perot was the Longfellow Deeds of 1992.
For decades, Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" has been America's foremost Christmas movie. "Deeds," centered on a folksy plutocrat who is compared to Santa Claus several times, may even be more appropriate.

Full text: Blink and you might have missed these viral but fleeting moments.
Plenty of big news happened in 2024. A top presidential candidate dropped out of the race late; another survived two assassination attempts; and voters rejected the incumbent administration at the ballot box. This year also included conflicts abroad, the Summer Olympics and two (yes, two) Emmy Award ceremonies.
But between these major flash points were hundreds of smaller moments.
While viral videos like "demure" and beloved animals like Moo Deng were virtually unavoidable -- and quickly became part of mainstream culture -- it's possible you didn't hear about "yapping" or know that another Pygmy hippo, named Haggis, was also born this year.
Maybe you can't forget that you, in fact, "exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you," but are you "holding space" for P'Nut the squirrel? (And if you can comprehend that sentence, you might have "brain rot.")
This is the year in micro news, an attempt to burst your algorithmic bubble and remind you of everything you already forgot about -- or maybe never knew about in the first place.
The Olympic
Do You Know the Muffin Man?
Of the many foods served at the Olympic Village in Paris, a humble chocolate muffin was elevated to TikTok meme status thanks to Henrik Christiansen, a Norwegian swimmer who documented his obsession with the baked goods in videos throughout the Games. In one video, a muffin even held him hostage.
His Job Is Horse
Stephen Nedoroscik had just one job: pommel horse. A bespectacled Olympic gymnast, otherwise known as Pommel Horse Guy, helped the U.S. men's team snag bronze, its first medal in 16 years. But it wasn't just his award-winning routine that made him a viral sensation. Images of Mr. Nedoroscik sitting on the sidelines, eyes closed in deep focus while waiting for his moment to shine, circulated widely.
Hop, Hop, Hip, Hop
Dr. Rachael Gunn, a professor from Australia also known as B-girl Raygun, became a household name this summer for her performance in the inaugural Olympic breaking competition -- though probably not for the reasons she may have been hoping. Her routine, which included kangaroolike hops, was subject to much scrutiny, and imitation, on social media.
She Shoots, She Scores
The South Korean sport shooter Kim Yeji didn't win a gold medal, but she would have if medals were awarded based on style alone. A clip of Ms. Yeji from an earlier competition circulated online after her turn at the Olympics, earning her the admiration of those who loved her cool, stoic demeanor and her cyberpunk-esque glasses, which some athletes wear in shooting competitions.
The Wholesome
Internet Mystery, Solved
For years, Reddit sleuths have hunted for the identity of a mystery woman known only as Celebrity Number Six. Her face was printed on fabric with several other easily recognizable celebrities, like Adriana Lima and Orlando Bloom, but nobody could name the sixth person. Until now. Her name is Leticia Sarda, a former model who is a mother of two and lives on the Spanish island of Tenerife. She was shocked to find out that people had been searching for her, she told The New York Times.
Fish Doorbell
Ding-dong. Who's there? A fish. A livestream of a river in the Dutch city of Utrecht allowed viewers to play a fun game with aquatic life while also helping fish procreate. When fish swim into frame, viewers press a button -- a fish doorbell, if you will -- to alert an employee to open up a dam to allow the creature to pass to shallower waters to spawn.
Pesto the Penguin
Though just a baby, Pesto, a king penguin at the Sea Life Aquarium in Melbourne, Australia, found fame for his overwhelming size. Weighing in at 46 pounds, the then-9-month-old bird developed a global fan base. (The aquarium later threw a gender reveal celebration for the penguin.)
She Screams, She Bites, She's Adorable
Moo Deng, a pygmy hippopotamus born this summer at the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand, quickly stole hearts around the world, thanks mostly to her being tiny and moist and having a penchant for biting things. Her name translates to "bouncy pork," and she even inspired a "Saturday Night Live" sketch.
Moo Deng? More Like Move Over.
Not to be outdone by a certain Thai creature, the Edinburgh Zoo jokingly began a small beef online with Moo Deng and her keepers after the birth of Haggis, another pygmy hippopotamus. "We were wrong to pit Haggis and Moo Deng against each other," the zoo later wrote in a notes-app style apology posted online. "There is space in this world for two beautiful pygmy hippo divas, and we should celebrate them all."
Fully Conscious Four Seasons Baby
"I have a question for everybody: Who wants to go to the Four Seasons Orlando?" Bailey Wise asked her family this year with the camera rolling. "Me," her 1-year-old daughter exclaimed, with a focus and understanding of the question seemingly far greater than her age would suggest. The video went viral -- and, yes, the family did go on that vacation.
The Aesthetic
Carmela Soprano Style
This microtrend, which came as quickly as it went, involved dressing like a stereotypical, cinematic so-called mob wife. Think fur coats, big hair, french manicures, heavy eyeliner and black dresses. Was it really a thing? For a moment, at least on TikTok, it was.
Bookshelf Wealth
Anxiety about status manifested itself in an internet-y design trend that can be boiled down to owning books and arranging them in a pleasing manner in your home. A viral how-to video spurred discourse about "bookshelf wealth," with some railing against the idea of buying books for purely aesthetic purposes and others critiquing what they saw as a rampant consumerism.
Unexpected Red
An incredibly simple yet popular TikTok-fueled design theory: Any room looks better with a pop of red where you least expect it. It piggybacked on the "pop of red" trend for styling clothes.
Robot Baby
Schiaparelli rocked Paris couture week with a special star on its runway: a high-tech robot baby covered in electrical panels, cables and crystals. No Freudian preoccupations with our robotic future to see here, thanks.
The Earwormy
Think You Can Stop What They Do? I Doubt It.
A group of kids participating in a songwriting program at an arts nonprofit in Cork, Ireland, accidentally created a hit. Called "The Spark," the song, which teetered right on the edge of sounding like something off a Kidz Bop album, captured hearts and ears around the world with its catchy drum-and-bass beat and earnest lyrics.
I Like My Sootcase
A resurfaced Larry King interview with Donald J. Trump from 2012 turned Mr. Trump's son Barron into a viral celebrity. In a clip posted to TikTok by The Daily Mail, a young Barron, who is now a college student, is heard saying "I like my suitcase" in a Slovenian accent similar to his mother Melania's. The clip was later remixed into a catchy song and inspired social media users to film themselves rolling around while zipped inside luggage.
Boots and a Slick Back Bun
A sing-songy internet trend born of a girls' night out. Maisie Sellwood, Amelia Gregorian and Eloise Lord, three friends who live in London, filmed themselves chanting the details of their outfits -- for example, "Boots and slicked-back bun. Boots and slicked-back bun." The rest was history. Millions of people watched their video and were inspired to create their own, including Amy Poehler, who filmed a version with Rashida Jones, Rachel Dratch and Seth Meyers.
Manhunt
Megan Boni, a TikTok creator who goes by @Girl_On_Couch, joked that she had written the song of the summer when, in a video this April, she recited the words "I'm looking for a man in finance, 6-5, blue eyes" in a particularly melodic manner. She wasn't entirely wrong. The tune took off, landed her a recording deal and inspired dating app profiles, think pieces and a club remix. A big year for tall guys in banking with recessive genes!
JoJo Siwa
The child star turned children's entertainer kicked off her grown-up career as a musician this year with a barrage of social media posts and interviews. One in particular took off: a red carpet clip of Ms. Siwa, dressed in a sequined bodysuit and makeup a la the band Kiss, answering a question about her dream podcast guest.
The Linguistic
Mama, a Girl Behind You
A years-old Facebook video became a lexical meme this year. In the clip, which was posted to Facebook by Keirra Denee' Smith in 2018, a child out of frame records Ms. Smith, who is posing in a yellow ensemble. Beside her is an animated augmented reality avatar, prompting the child to say "mama, a girl behind you." Six years later, in 2024, people began using that phrase again, but this time to talk about whatever was behind or beside someone. (Just watch this.)
Loud Budgeting
A term coined on TikTok by the comedian Lukas Battle, "loud budgeting" came as an antidote to "quiet luxury," which dominated 2023. If last year was about spending vast sums of money on, say, a simple pair of pants, in 2024 the trend -- at least the one Mr. Battle tried to start -- was being noisy about how much money you were saving and your financial goals.
Rawdogging
A word typically used to describe sexual intercourse without a condom became a popular term online to describe any situation without a buffer, like taking a long flight without bringing anything to entertain yourself.
Very Demure, Very Mindful
The online creator Jools Lebron popularized the word "demure" this year in a series of TikTok videos in which she offered instructions on how to embody the term, with tips for "demure" hair and makeup. Almost overnight it seemed as if the word was on everyone's ("very cutesy") lips, and brands swiftly seized on it. In December, Dictionary.com made "demure" its word of the year.
Yapping
An old word for talking took on new meaning. Yapping, at least according to many on TikTok, is talking ad nauseam, usually about something silly. "Somebody that just keeps on talking to fill the air -- if it gets quiet, they just don't stop talking," Nicole Limas, an influencer and self-described yapper who lives in Chicago, explained to The Times.
Brainrot
If you know what this word means, you might already have it. Symptoms include endless scrolling on social media and hyper-fluency in every other micro-news item on this list.
The Political
Tim Walz Has a Hot Take
Adding to his image as a Minnesota dad and normal guy, Gov. Tim Walz waxed poetic about the importance of gutter maintenance during an appearance on the TikTok show "Subway Takes," hosted by Kareem Rahma.
Existing in a Context
We all do. But Vice President Kamala Harris reminded Americans of this fact in a now-famous clip of a speech she gave last year at a White House event. "You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?" she said, quoting her mother. "You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you." Though the speech went relatively unnoticed at the time, it took off online this year, and Ms. Harris's words were remixed into pop songs by artists like Chappell Roan. Some Harris supporters even put coconut and palm tree emoji into their social media bios as a sign of solidarity.
All Things "Brat"
The hit album by Charli XCX became a meme in its own right, largely thanks to the putrid green color of the cover art and a TikTok dance to the song "Apple." Both became inescapable this summer. "Brat" turned political after the singer wrote "kamala IS brat" in a post on X about Ms. Harris, whose campaign quickly seized on the verdant hue in its branding.
JD Vance Orders Doughnuts
Mr. Trump's running mate had several viral moments this year, including a particularly memorable -- and awkward, many on social media would say -- visit to a doughnut shop on the campaign trail and an N.S.F.W. internet rumor about a couch.
Wolf Spritzer
The CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer had just sat down to enjoy a nice "Wolf Spritzer" at a restaurant in Washington, D.C., when the news broke that President Biden would no longer be seeking re-election. (Or, at least that was how the chronology appeared when Mr. Blitzer posted about his namesake beverage on X.) He was back in the studio soon after to cover the bombshell news. (By the way, that's Aperol, mezcal, sparkling wine and lemon juice, if you're looking to make one yourself.)
New York Is the _____ of America
This year, Mayor Eric Adams of New York adopted a strange signature catchphrase likening New York City to literally any other city. New York City is the Athens of America. The Islamabad of America. The Kyiv of America. The Mexico City of America. The Dublin of America. You get the idea.
The Cinematic
Twist Ending
Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones, the romantic leads of "Twisters," do NOT kiss in the end. Oh, sorry, spoiler alert. Now you know. People online were frustrated with the film's anticlimactic ending.
Popcorn Buckets
The humble vessel got a slightly N.S.F.W. twist this year when AMC Theaters released a promotional popcorn bucket for "Dune: Part Two." It was designed to look like a sandworm, but others saw something ... quite different.
He Was in the Amazon with My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Just Before She Died
There really isn't anything to say other than: "He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders just before she died." (Just kidding. This was a particularly ridiculous line from "Madame Web," the mega-flop film that inspired as many memes as pan reviews.)
'Holding Space'
The press tour for "Wicked" included a seemingly endless amount of interviews, but one stood out. In a brief and baffling sit-down with Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, a journalist from Out magazine posed a nonquestion that birthed a viral catchphrase. "I've seen this week people are taking the lyrics of 'Defying Gravity' and really holding space with that and feeling power in that," the journalist, Tracy E. Gilchrist, said. What exactly does it mean to "hold space?" Ms. Gilchrist has her own definition, but as the term spread across social media, it took on a life of its own.
Reesa Teesa
Rivaling Martin Scorsese, Tareasa Johnson, better known as Reesa Teesa, had millions of viewers on TikTok rapt this year as she produced a multipart drama detailing, over the course of 50 videos, her recollection of her wild and bizarre relationship with a man she called by the code name Legion. Now, her story is being adapted for television.
The Expected
Tradwives Rise
Content creators like Nara Smith and Hannah Neeleman, known for her family business, Ballerina Farm, were seemingly everywhere this year, whipping up fresh bread and elaborate recipes for their husbands and children. From scratch, of course. Are they merely savvy influencers or are they, as some detractors have argued, bleak symbols of a rejection of modern feminism? At a time when many political debates center on gender, it's little surprise these women have become lightning rods.
Airplane Cheater
The episode was a frightening reminder that we are all just going through our lives waiting to unwittingly become content. A passenger on a flight from Houston to New York City filmed and posted multiple TikTok videos of a man and a woman the passenger claimed were having an affair, even going so far as to call them out by name. The videos started a heated discussion online: Was it vigilante justice or a breach of privacy?
Thin Is In
Liv Schmidt became a controversial figure on TikTok this year, with some people accusing her of glorifying eating disorders with her dieting advice. The debate over Ms. Schmidt was just one of many that centered on so-called thinspo, as medications like Ozempic have become all but ubiquitous.
Slop at the Top
This was the year that search results went to hell thanks largely to the rise of "slop," the A.I.-generated responses that now appear at the top of many a search engine and often leave a lot to be desired factually.
The Unexpected
New York Quake
For a brief moment in April, X shook itself back to something resembling what it was like in the olden days, when it was called Twitter and before Elon Musk owned it. All it took was a rare earthquake felt in New York City to get users posting like it was 2010. The memes that followed the magnitude-4.8 quake weren't so bad, either.
Hawk Tuah Girl
She threw the ceremonial first pitch at a Mets game. She sold tens of thousands of dollars in merchandise. She hosts a podcast. It all started when Haliey Welch participated in a person-on-the-street interview in Nashville where she was asked to answer the question "What's one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?" Her response was a guttural simulation of a sex act, best spelled phonetically as "hawk tuah."
Willy Wonk-ish
A Willy Wonka-themed event in Glasgow promised "optical marvels" and fun for the whole family. Instead, the event, which amounted to a few jelly beans and some halfhearted costumes, was such a flop it made international news and closed early. Someone even called the police.
Somebody Dropped the Ball
After paying anywhere from $ 150 to as much as $ 1,000 a ticket, attendees had high hopes for a "Bridgerton"-themed ball held in Detroit this fall (an event notably not affiliated with Netflix). But when they arrived, some social media users said, they found a mostly empty hall with a solo violinist and a pole dancer who was bafflingly hired to work the event. (She was confused, too, she later said.)
Checking In
In January, the X account for Elmo of "Sesame Street" posted a simple question: "Elmo is just checking in! How is everybody doing?" What followed was a surprisingly tender flood of answers from people eager to let Elmo know that they weren't doing that great, actually, but thanked him for asking.
The Bleak
The Curious Case of the Missing Princess
Before Catherine, Princess of Wales, announced her cancer diagnosis, wild and often cruel rumors about her whereabouts blanketed social media. These tall tales were only heightened after Kensington Palace issued and later withdrew a Mother's Day photo of the princess with her children that had been edited.
A Nutty Tale
P'Nut, a pet squirrel with a popular Instagram account run by his owner, was seized by the authorities in New York State this fall and euthanized to test him for rabies after he was said to have bitten someone. His death prompted outcry from his many fans and turned him into a unifying symbol for Republicans, who said the episode was a prime example of government overreach.
Pookie and Jett
It was wholesome enough. Campbell and Jett Puckett first became known online for their videos in which Mr. Puckett hypes up his wife, whom he refers to affectionately as "Pookie." But then internet sleuths uncovered photos of Ms. Puckett posing in front of a Confederate flag and wearing an old-fashioned gown that some online said was a costume for an "Old South" plantation-themed ball. (She later apologized for the photos in an email to The Times.)
The Portal
A piece of technology connecting two faraway cities in real time started out as a nice idea, but quickly soured after the art installation, in New York City and Dublin, was overrun by pranksters and violent imagery, like swastikas and footage from Sept. 11.
Too Young to Be So Old
Everyone worries about getting older, but add the ubiquity of cosmetic surgery and front-facing cameras to the mix, and it begins to explain why Gen Z has become perhaps uniquely preoccupied. This year, some online argued that today's young people are aging more rapidly, thanks to swaths of early youth-prolonging cosmetic interventions. They call it "aging like milk."
The Sock War
A new battlefield emerged this year in the ongoing intergenerational war. This fight played out on ankles, where the height of your sock was said to betray your age. Were you team ankle or team crew?
This Is Going to Ruin the Tour
These were the words that Justin Timberlake was said to have uttered to the police during his arrest in June on drunken-driving charges in the Hamptons, according to Page Six. "What tour," the police asked the singer. "The world tour," he responded, which, along with his mug shot, led to a thousand memes.
The Delightful
I Hate Gay Halloween
The rise of internet culture has made Halloween costumes increasingly specific and difficult to discern without the accompanying niche post or video that explains the bit. This year, the post itself became the costume, with a meme that affectionately skewered the idea of "gay Halloween," a holiday for online gags targeting incredibly specific audiences.
Cucumber Boy
It's pretty straightforward. Logan Moffitt was named "Cucumber Boy" after millions of people on TikTok watched him slice, salt and shake up various containers of cucumber salads this summer.
Tall Couple
He was a (tall) boy. She was a (tall) girl. Can I make it any more obvious? Sparks appeared to fly when Tyler Bergantino did a person-on-the-street interview with Gabby Gonzalez on TikTok. Viewers were struck by their flirty vibe and, notably, their similar statures.
One Million Checkboxes
One Million Checkboxes is a simple online game that asks players to click or unclick check boxes. See, simple! Designed by Nolen Royalty, a game developer in Brooklyn, the boxes brought joy to some players, who found them soothingly compelling, while others were stressed out by the endeavor since the boxes were constantly being checked and unchecked by thousands of people at a time.
Chicken Shop Date
Amelia Dimoldenberg does her best to cultivate a flirty vibe with all of the guests on her popular YouTube show "Chicken Shop Date," but they don't always dish it back. Her chemistry with Andrew Garfield, however, felt palpable to many.
Match My Freak
The Tinashe song "Nasty" inspired a TikTok trend in which people, using the lyrics "is somebody going to match my freak," ask the internet if somebody would, please, match their freak. Except in these cases, "freak" usually meant something hyper-specific and mundane, like "drinking 8 diet cokes before noon and feeling nothing."
Holding Even More Space
Steve Burns, who hosted the Nickelodeon children's show "Blue's Clues" from 1996 to 2002, has found a new calling as an empathetic TikTok star. In his videos, Mr. Burns simply sits quietly, offering the viewer a chance to talk to him about their lives and struggles. "They are deliberately simple," Mr. Burns told The Times in September. "I try to do as little as possible on TikTok other than deeply listen."
Attack of the Clones
An IRL viral phenomenon, celebrity look-alike competitions went global. One in Washington Square Park in New York City, for instance, sought to find the floppy-haired young man who looked the most like the actor Timothée Chalamet. A winner was crowned -- amid scenes of chaos as the crowd kept growing in size and the police made arrests -- but the true prize was an appearance by Mr. Chalamet himself.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Private messages detail an alleged campaign to tarnish Blake Lively after she accused Justin Baldoni of misconduct on the set of "It Ends With Us."
Last summer, as the release of "It Ends With Us" approached, Justin Baldoni, the director and a star of the film, and Jamey Heath, the lead producer, hired a crisis public relations expert.
During shooting, Blake Lively, the co-star, had complained that the men had repeatedly violated physical boundaries and made sexual and other inappropriate comments to her. Their studio, Wayfarer, agreed to provide a full-time intimacy coordinator, bring in an outside producer and put other safeguards on set. In a side letter to Ms. Lively's contract, signed by Mr. Heath, the studio also agreed not to retaliate against the actress.
But by August, the two men, who had positioned themselves as feminist allies in the #MeToo era, expressed fears that her allegations would become public and taint them, according to a legal complaint that she filed Friday. It claims that their P.R. effort had an explicit goal: to harm Ms. Lively's reputation instead.
Her filing includes excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails that she obtained through a subpoena. These and other documents were reviewed by The New York Times.
There have long been figures behind the scenes shaping public opinion about celebrities -- through gossip columns, tabloids and strategic interviews. The documents show an additional playbook for waging a largely undetectable smear campaign in the digital era. While the film, about domestic violence, was a box office hit -- making nearly $ 350 million worldwide -- online criticism of the actress skyrocketed.
"He wants to feel like she can be buried," a publicist working with the studio and Mr. Baldoni wrote in an Aug. 2 message to the crisis management expert, Melissa Nathan.
"You know we can bury anyone," Ms. Nathan wrote.
In the following weeks, Ms. Nathan, whose clients have included Johnny Depp and the rappers Drake and Travis Scott, went hard at the press, pushing to prevent stories about Mr. Baldoni's behavior and reinforce negative ones about Ms. Lively, the text messages show. Jed Wallace, a self-described "hired gun," led a digital strategy that included boosting social media posts that could help their cause.
An attorney for Wayfarer said in a statement to The Times that the studio, its executives and public relations representatives "did nothing proactive nor retaliated" against Ms. Lively, and accused the actress of "another desperate attempt to 'fix' her negative reputation."
"These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media," the lawyer, Bryan Freedman, wrote.
Mr. Freedman did not address her allegations about misconduct during the filming by Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath. He alleged that Ms. Lively planted "negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media" about Mr. Baldoni, which he said "was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional."
The effort to tarnish Ms. Lively appears to have paid off. Within days of the film's release, the negative media coverage and commentary became an unusually high percentage of her online presence, according to a forensic review she sought from a brand marketing consultant.
Ms. Lively -- who is married to the actor and entrepreneur Ryan Reynolds of "Deadpool" fame, and is close with Taylor Swift -- experienced the biggest reputational hit of her career. She was branded tone-deaf, difficult to work with, a bully. Sales of her new hair-care line plummeted.
"Is Blake Lively set to be CANCELLED?" read a Daily Mail headline one week into the attacks.
Mr. Baldoni, by contrast, emerged largely unscathed. This month, he was honored at a star-studded event celebrating men who "elevate women, combat gender-based violence and promote gender equality worldwide." On Saturday, however, after this article was published, the talent agency William Morris Endeavor stopped representing Mr. Baldoni, said Ari Emanuel, chief executive of Endeavor, the agency's parent company.
Ms. Lively's complaint -- against Mr. Baldoni; Mr. Heath; Wayfarer; Steve Sarowitz, a co-founder of the studio; Mr. Wallace; Ms. Nathan; and Jennifer Abel, another public relations executive involved in the campaign -- alleges sexual harassment and retaliation, among other claims. The complaint, filed with the California Civil Rights Department, is a precursor to a lawsuit.
In a statement, Ms. Lively said, "I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted."
She also denied that she or any of her representatives planted or spread negative information about Mr. Baldoni or Wayfarer.
'We Should Have a Plan'
In May, several months after the filming wrapped, Mr. Baldoni realized that Mr. Reynolds had blocked him on Instagram.
"We should have a plan for IF she does the same when movie comes out," Mr. Baldoni wrote of Ms. Lively in a text exchange that included Ms. Abel, a publicist who has long worked with him and Wayfarer. "Plans make me feel more at ease."
Mr. Baldoni, 40, and Mr. Heath, 55, had a lot riding on the film, which is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover.
Mr. Baldoni was best known for the CW satirical romantic dramedy "Jane the Virgin." Wayfarer provided the resources for bigger ambitions. It was bankrolled by the billionaire Steve Sarowitz, who is co-chair of the studio with Mr. Baldoni. They and Mr. Heath, the chief executive, are all deeply involved with the Baha'i religious organization, which promotes unity, peace and gender equality. Mr. Baldoni has presented himself as an ally to women, writing books, co-hosting a podcast with Mr. Heath and giving talks on toxic masculinity.
Ms. Lively, 37, was by far the bigger star. The TV show "Gossip Girl" catapulted her to early fame, and she appeared in films ranging from "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" to "The Town." She built businesses outside the entertainment industry, appeared on the covers of glossy magazines and amassed more than 45 million Instagram followers.
Ms. Lively had expressed concerns about Mr. Baldoni from the beginning, according to her legal complaint. Before shooting began, for example, she objected to sex scenes he wanted to add that she considered gratuitous.
In November 2023, as the cast of "It Ends With Us" was preparing to resume shooting after a monthslong writers' strike, Ms. Lively went to Wayfarer with the side letter seeking safeguards.
"Our client is willing to forego a more formal HR process in favor of everyone returning to work and finishing the Film as long as the set is safe moving forward," her legal team wrote to the studio.
She detailed her complaints during a meeting with Mr. Baldoni, Mr. Heath and other producers in January, according to the legal filing. She claimed Mr. Baldoni had improvised unwanted kissing and discussed his sex life, including encounters in which he said he may not have received consent. Mr. Heath had shown her a video of his wife naked, she said, and he had watched Ms. Lively in her trailer when she was topless and having body makeup removed, despite her asking him to look away. She said that both men repeatedly entered her makeup trailer uninvited while she was undressed, including when she was breastfeeding.
In agreeing to the terms that Ms. Lively sought, Wayfarer acknowledged that "Although our perspective differs in many aspects, ensuring a safe environment for all is paramount," according to her legal complaint.
By the spring, Ms. Lively told people she worked with that the men's behavior had improved with the new protections.
But she was now in a creative battle with them. With the support of Sony, the film's distributor, she made her own cut of the movie, bringing in editors and a composer and adding one of Ms. Swift's songs.
In the end, Sony and Wayfarer went with Ms. Lively's cut, and she got a producer credit.
As the film release neared, Ms. Lively and other cast members informed Sony and Wayfarer that they would not do any appearances alongside Mr. Baldoni. So did Ms. Hoover, the author, who had her own dissatisfactions with him and had become more upset after he told her about Ms. Lively's allegations, according to text messages from Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath.
'Most Importantly Untraceable'
By the first week of August, Wayfarer and Mr. Baldoni had retained Ms. Nathan, who had worked with high-profile clients including Mr. Depp, whose ex-wife, Amber Heard, accused him of physical abuse.
Mr. Depp successfully sued Ms. Heard for defamation, and the trial became a spectacle amid suspicions of an online campaign to damage her credibility.
This year, after a decade at the New York consultancy Hiltzik Strategies, Ms. Nathan started her own firm, TAG PR. Its majority stakeholder is a company run by the entertainment industry executive Scooter Braun.
In an initial planning document sent to Wayfarer and Mr. Baldoni on Aug. 2, Ms. Nathan suggested media talking points, including that Ms. Lively used an imbalance of power to take creative control of the film.
But Mr. Baldoni wanted more.
"Not in love with the document they sent," he responded in a text exchange that included Ms. Abel and Mr. Heath. "Not sure I'm feeling the protection I felt on the call."
Ms. Abel relayed his frustration to Ms. Nathan: "I think you guys need to be tough and show the strength of what you guys can do in these scenarios. He wants to feel like she can be buried."
"Of course- but you know when we send over documents we can't send over the work we will or could do because that could get us in a lot of trouble," Ms. Nathan responded, adding, "We can't write we will destroy her."
Moments later, she said, "Imagine if a document saying all the things that he wants ends up in the wrong hands."
"You know we can bury anyone," she wrote.
Three days later, Mr. Baldoni texted Ms. Abel, flagging a social media thread that accused another celebrity of bullying behavior and had generated 19 million views. "This is what we would need," he wrote.
Ms. Nathan soon floated proposals to hire contractors to dominate social media through "full social account take downs," by starting "threads of theories" and generally working to "change narrative."
"All of this will be most importantly untraceable," she wrote.
Within days, the group was working with Mr. Wallace, whose company, Street Relations, offers services ranging from public relations to more opaque crisis management. He is a somewhat enigmatic figure with very little digital trail. But court records show that his clients have included Paramount Pictures and the YouTube personality Adin Ross.
And in a since-deleted LinkedIn profile, Mr. Wallace described himself as "a hired gun" with a "proprietary formula for defining artists and trends."
'That's Why You Hired Me'
The Aug. 6 premiere brought the first wave of press coverage questioning what had happened during the filming. A Hollywood Reporter story speculated about a rift between Ms Lively and Mr. Baldoni, after TikTokers noticed that the two stars didn't pose for photographs together and that Ms. Lively and other cast members didn't follow Mr. Baldoni on Instagram.
Ms. Nathan had already been speaking to other journalists, according to text messages.
When Ms. Abel wrote to her Aug. 4 that "I'm having reckless thoughts of wanting to plant pieces this week of how horrible Blake is to work with. Just to get ahead of it," Ms. Nathan replied that she had spoken off the record to an editor at The Daily Mail.
"She's ready when we are," Ms. Nathan wrote.
A flurry of articles followed the Hollywood Reporter piece. Many made it seem as if the only rift was over creative control. Some journalists had gotten wind of complaints about Mr. Baldoni's behavior, but none of the most serious ones were published.
"He doesn't realise how lucky he is right now," Ms. Nathan texted Ms. Abel.
In other exchanges, Ms. Nathan claimed that she had kept allegations against him out of stories, writing in one message that major news outlets were "standing down on HR complaint."
Meanwhile, an online backlash against Ms. Lively was underway. It is impossible to know how much of the negative publicity was seeded by Ms. Nathan, Mr. Wallace and their team, and how much they noticed and amplified.
On Aug. 10, Kjersti Flaa, a Norwegian entertainment reporter, uploaded to YouTube a 2016 interview in which Ms. Lively snapped back when Ms. Flaa commented on her baby "bump" and remained testy for the rest of the conversation. Ms. Flaa titled it "The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job," and told The Daily Mail that "it's time that people behaving badly in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter, gets called out for it."
After publication of this article, Ms. Flaa on Sunday contacted The Times and said she had not participated in any orchestrated effort to harm Ms. Lively's reputation. In an email, she said that she had resurfaced the 2016 interview independently this past August. "It was neither coordinated nor influenced by anyone associated with the alleged campaign," she wrote.
It wasn't the first time she had posted a video aligned with a client of Ms. Nathan. In 2022, in the midst of Mr. Depp's legal battle with Ms. Heard, Ms. Flaa posted clips of her interviews with the actor, tagged #JusticeForJohnnyDepp.
During the film rollout, Ms. Lively was also accused of being insensitive about domestic violence. The official promotion plan instructed the cast to focus more on the uplifting aspects of the movie than on abuse, and to embrace a floral theme (her character has a flower shop). In several appearances, she never made reference to domestic violence at all. And she faced criticism when her Betty Booze beverage company was promoting the film, given the role alcohol can play in abusive relationships.
Seeing that blowback, the text messages show, Mr. Baldoni and his P.R. team decided instead to highlight survivors of domestic violence in his interviews and social media.
More criticism came when Ms. Lively said in an interview that Mr. Reynolds, who had no role in the film, had helped rewrite a scene, prompting snarky comments about the actress leaning on her husband and speculation that he had violated the writers strike.
It is unclear exactly how Mr. Wallace operated. There are references in emails to "social manipulation" and "proactive fan posting," and text messages cite efforts to "boost" and "amplify" online content that was favorable to Mr. Baldoni or critical of Ms. Lively.
"We are crushing it on Reddit," Mr. Wallace told Ms. Nathan, according to a text she sent Ms. Abel on Aug. 9.
The next day, one of Ms. Nathan's employees texted, "We've started to see shift on social, due largely to Jed and his team's efforts to shift the narrative."
Ms. Nathan wrote to Ms. Abel: "And socials are really really ramping up. In his favour, she must be furious. It's actually sad because it just shows you have people really want to hate on women."
When a TikTok sleuth started asking questions about Mr. Baldoni, Ms. Abel texted that "this girl is on a very dangerous crusade."
"We've flagged to Jed and his team for more serious action on the social side," she wrote.
Throughout the text exchanges, Mr. Baldoni encourages the P.R. team, sometimes flagging social media posts for them to use. On Aug. 15, he proposes "flipping the narrative" on a positive story about Ms. Lively and her husband by "using their own words against them."
Other times he appears to vacillate, seeking assurances about the tactics being deployed. When he notices a tabloid article critical of Ms. Lively, he sends a worried text: "How can we say somehow that we are not doing any of this -- it looks like we are trying to take her down." On another occasion, he wondered whether they were deploying fake "bot" accounts on social media.
"I can fully fully confirm we do not have bots," Ms. Nathan wrote, adding that any digital team would be too intelligent to "utilise something so obvious."
Mr. Wallace's operation, she wrote, "is doing something very specific in terms of what they do. I know Jamey & Jed connected on this."
Mr. Baldoni, Ms. Nathan and others on the team claimed in their text exchanges that Ms. Lively was using her own public relations team to create bad press about Mr. Baldoni but cited no evidence to support those claims.
By mid-August, the team was reveling in the damage to Ms. Lively's image.
On Aug. 16, Ms. Nathan shared the Daily Mail article headlined "Is Blake Lively set to be CANCELLED?" with references to 'hard to watch' videos and a 'tone deaf' promotional Q. and A.
"Wow. You really outdid yourself with this piece," Ms. Abel responded.
"That's why you hired me right?" Ms. Nathan replied. "I'm the best."
'We Men Have to Step Up'
A brand marketing consultant, Terakeet, produced a report in August for Ms. Lively that concluded she had likely been the object of a "targeted, multichannel online attack" similar to one against Ms. Heard, and that it was damaging her reputation.
The report did not identify who was behind the attack. But by analyzing "the entirety of Google's search index" for Ms. Lively's name, it found that 35 percent of the results also included a reference to Mr. Baldoni. This was highly unusual given the length of her career, the company said, and suggested that the media environment was being manipulated.
A separate report, by Ms. Lively's hair-care company, Blake Brown, concluded that the social media onslaught also had a negative effect on that business. Her product line, which had launched in August with record-breaking sales, estimates that it lost as much as 78 percent in sales.
With the recent arrival of "It Ends With Us" on Netflix, Mr. Baldoni has begun another round of promotion and messaging.
In an interview on "Access Hollywood," he said "there is never an excuse" to "hurt a woman, physically or emotionally." He added, "We men have to step up and figure out how we can be better allies."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Last summer, as the release of "It Ends With Us" approached, Justin Baldoni, the director and a star of the film, and Jamey Heath, the lead producer, hired a crisis public relations expert.
During shooting, Blake Lively, the co-star, had complained that the men had repeatedly violated physical boundaries and made sexual and other inappropriate comments to her. Their studio, Wayfarer, agreed to provide a full-time intimacy coordinator, bring in an outside producer and put other safeguards on set. In a side letter to Ms. Lively's contract, signed by Mr. Heath, the studio also agreed not to retaliate against the actress.
But by August, the two men, who had positioned themselves as feminist allies in the #MeToo era, expressed fears that her allegations would become public and taint them, according to a legal complaint that she filed Friday. It claims that their P.R. effort had an explicit goal: to harm Ms. Lively's reputation instead.
Her filing includes excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails that she obtained through a subpoena. These and other documents were reviewed by The New York Times.
There have long been figures behind the scenes shaping public opinion about celebrities -- through gossip columns, tabloids and strategic interviews. The documents show an additional playbook for waging a largely undetectable smear campaign in the digital era. While the film, about domestic violence, was a box office hit -- making nearly $ 350 million worldwide -- online criticism of the actress skyrocketed.
"He wants to feel like she can be buried," a publicist working with the studio and Mr. Baldoni wrote in an Aug. 2 message to the crisis management expert, Melissa Nathan.
"You know we can bury anyone," Ms. Nathan wrote.
In the following weeks, Ms. Nathan, whose clients have included Johnny Depp and the rappers Drake and Travis Scott, went hard at the press, pushing to prevent stories about Mr. Baldoni's behavior and reinforce negative ones about Ms. Lively, the text messages show. Jed Wallace, a self-described "hired gun," led a digital strategy that included boosting social media posts that could help their cause.
An attorney for Wayfarer said in a statement to The Times that the studio, its executives and public relations representatives "did nothing proactive nor retaliated" against Ms. Lively, and accused the actress of "another desperate attempt to 'fix' her negative reputation."
"These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media," the lawyer, Bryan Freedman, wrote.
Mr. Freedman did not address her allegations about misconduct during the filming by Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath. He alleged that Ms. Lively planted "negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media" about Mr. Baldoni, which he said "was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional."
The effort to tarnish Ms. Lively appears to have paid off. Within days of the film's release, the negative media coverage and commentary became an unusually high percentage of her online presence, according to a forensic review she sought from a brand marketing consultant.
Ms. Lively -- who is married to the actor and entrepreneur Ryan Reynolds of "Deadpool" fame, and is close with Taylor Swift -- experienced the biggest reputational hit of her career. She was branded tone-deaf, difficult to work with, a bully. Sales of her new hair-care line plummeted.
"Is Blake Lively set to be CANCELLED?" read a Daily Mail headline one week into the attacks.
Mr. Baldoni, by contrast, emerged largely unscathed. This month, he was honored at a star-studded event celebrating men who "elevate women, combat gender-based violence and promote gender equality worldwide." On Saturday, however, after this article was published, the talent agency William Morris Endeavor stopped representing Mr. Baldoni, said Ari Emanuel, chief executive of Endeavor, the agency's parent company.
Ms. Lively's complaint -- against Mr. Baldoni; Mr. Heath; Wayfarer; Steve Sarowitz, a co-founder of the studio; Mr. Wallace; Ms. Nathan; and Jennifer Abel, another public relations executive involved in the campaign -- alleges sexual harassment and retaliation, among other claims. The complaint, filed with the California Civil Rights Department, is a precursor to a lawsuit.
In a statement, Ms. Lively said, "I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted."
She also denied that she or any of her representatives planted or spread negative information about Mr. Baldoni or Wayfarer.
'We Should Have a Plan'
In May, several months after the filming wrapped, Mr. Baldoni realized that Mr. Reynolds had blocked him on Instagram.
"We should have a plan for IF she does the same when movie comes out," Mr. Baldoni wrote of Ms. Lively in a text exchange that included Ms. Abel, a publicist who has long worked with him and Wayfarer. "Plans make me feel more at ease."
Mr. Baldoni, 40, and Mr. Heath, 55, had a lot riding on the film, which is based on a best-selling novel by Colleen Hoover.
Mr. Baldoni was best known for the CW satirical romantic dramedy "Jane the Virgin." Wayfarer provided the resources for bigger ambitions. It was bankrolled by the billionaire Steve Sarowitz, who is co-chair of the studio with Mr. Baldoni. They and Mr. Heath, the chief executive, are all deeply involved with the Baha'i religious organization, which promotes unity, peace and gender equality. Mr. Baldoni has presented himself as an ally to women, writing books, co-hosting a podcast with Mr. Heath and giving talks on toxic masculinity.
Ms. Lively, 37, was by far the bigger star. The TV show "Gossip Girl" catapulted her to early fame, and she appeared in films ranging from "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" to "The Town." She built businesses outside the entertainment industry, appeared on the covers of glossy magazines and amassed more than 45 million Instagram followers.
Ms. Lively had expressed concerns about Mr. Baldoni from the beginning, according to her legal complaint. Before shooting began, for example, she objected to sex scenes he wanted to add that she considered gratuitous.
In November 2023, as the cast of "It Ends With Us" was preparing to resume shooting after a monthslong writers' strike, Ms. Lively went to Wayfarer with the side letter seeking safeguards.
"Our client is willing to forego a more formal HR process in favor of everyone returning to work and finishing the Film as long as the set is safe moving forward," her legal team wrote to the studio.
She detailed her complaints during a meeting with Mr. Baldoni, Mr. Heath and other producers in January, according to the legal filing. She claimed Mr. Baldoni had improvised unwanted kissing and discussed his sex life, including encounters in which he said he may not have received consent. Mr. Heath had shown her a video of his wife naked, she said, and he had watched Ms. Lively in her trailer when she was topless and having body makeup removed, despite her asking him to look away. She said that both men repeatedly entered her makeup trailer uninvited while she was undressed, including when she was breastfeeding.
In agreeing to the terms that Ms. Lively sought, Wayfarer acknowledged that "Although our perspective differs in many aspects, ensuring a safe environment for all is paramount," according to her legal complaint.
By the spring, Ms. Lively told people she worked with that the men's behavior had improved with the new protections.
But she was now in a creative battle with them. With the support of Sony, the film's distributor, she made her own cut of the movie, bringing in editors and a composer and adding one of Ms. Swift's songs.
In the end, Sony and Wayfarer went with Ms. Lively's cut, and she got a producer credit.
As the film release neared, Ms. Lively and other cast members informed Sony and Wayfarer that they would not do any appearances alongside Mr. Baldoni. So did Ms. Hoover, the author, who had her own dissatisfactions with him and had become more upset after he told her about Ms. Lively's allegations, according to text messages from Mr. Baldoni and Mr. Heath.
'Untraceable'
By the first week of August, Wayfarer and Mr. Baldoni had retained Ms. Nathan, who had worked with high-profile clients including Mr. Depp, whose ex-wife, Amber Heard, accused him of physical abuse.
Mr. Depp successfully sued Ms. Heard for defamation, and the trial became a spectacle amid suspicions of an online campaign to damage her credibility.
This year, after a decade at the New York consultancy Hiltzik Strategies, Ms. Nathan started her own firm, TAG PR. Its majority stakeholder is a company run by the entertainment industry executive Scooter Braun.
In an initial planning document sent to Wayfarer and Mr. Baldoni on Aug. 2, Ms. Nathan suggested media talking points, including that Ms. Lively used an imbalance of power to take creative control of the film.
But Mr. Baldoni wanted more.
"Not in love with the document they sent," he responded in a text exchange that included Ms. Abel and Mr. Heath. "Not sure I'm feeling the protection I felt on the call."
Ms. Abel relayed his frustration to Ms. Nathan: "I think you guys need to be tough and show the strength of what you guys can do in these scenarios. He wants to feel like she can be buried."
"Of course- but you know when we send over documents we can't send over the work we will or could do because that could get us in a lot of trouble," Ms. Nathan responded, adding, "We can't write we will destroy her."
Moments later, she said, "Imagine if a document saying all the things that he wants ends up in the wrong hands."
"You know we can bury anyone," she wrote.
Three days later, Mr. Baldoni texted Ms. Abel, flagging a social media thread that accused another celebrity of bullying behavior and had generated 19 million views. "This is what we would need," he wrote.
Ms. Nathan soon floated proposals to hire contractors to dominate social media through "full social account take downs," by starting "threads of theories" and generally working to "change narrative."
"All of this will be most importantly untraceable," she wrote.
Within days, the group was working with Mr. Wallace, whose company, Street Relations, offers services ranging from public relations to more opaque crisis management. He is a somewhat enigmatic figure with very little digital trail. But court records show that his clients have included Paramount Pictures and the YouTube personality Adin Ross.
And in a since-deleted LinkedIn profile, Mr. Wallace described himself as "a hired gun" with a "proprietary formula for defining artists and trends."
'That's Why You Hired Me'
The Aug. 6 premiere brought the first wave of press coverage questioning what had happened during the filming. A Hollywood Reporter story speculated about a rift between Ms Lively and Mr. Baldoni, after TikTokers noticed that the two stars didn't pose for photographs together and that Ms. Lively and other cast members didn't follow Mr. Baldoni on Instagram.
Ms. Nathan had already been speaking to other journalists, according to text messages.
When Ms. Abel wrote to her Aug. 4 that "I'm having reckless thoughts of wanting to plant pieces this week of how horrible Blake is to work with. Just to get ahead of it," Ms. Nathan replied that she had spoken off the record to an editor at The Daily Mail.
"She's ready when we are," Ms. Nathan wrote.
A flurry of articles followed the Hollywood Reporter piece. Many made it seem as if the only rift was over creative control. Some journalists had gotten wind of complaints about Mr. Baldoni's behavior, but none of the most serious ones were published.

Meanwhile, an online backlash against Ms. Lively was underway. It is impossible to know how much of the negative publicity was seeded by Ms. Nathan, Mr. Wallace and their team, and how much they noticed and amplified.
On Aug. 10, Kjersti Flaa, a Norwegian entertainment reporter, uploaded to YouTube a 2016 interview in which Ms. Lively snapped back when Ms. Flaa commented on her baby "bump" and remained testy for the rest of the conversation. Ms. Flaa titled it "The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job," and told The Daily Mail that "it's time that people behaving badly in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter, gets called out for it."
It wasn't the first time she had posted a video aligned with a client of Ms. Nathan. In 2022, in the midst of Mr. Depp's legal battle with Ms. Heard, Ms. Flaa posted clips of her interviews with the actor, tagged #JusticeForJohnnyDepp.
After publication of this article, Ms. Flaa on Sunday contacted The Times and said she had not participated in any orchestrated effort to harm Ms. Lively's reputation. In an email, she said that she had resurfaced the 2016 interview independently this past August. "It was neither coordinated nor influenced by anyone associated with the alleged campaign," she wrote.

Last summer, as the release of “It Ends With Us” approached, Justin Baldoni, the director and a star of the film, and Jamey Heath, the lead producer, hired a crisis public relations expert.
During shooting, co-star Blake Lively had complained that the men had repeatedly violated physical boundaries and made sexual and other inappropriate comments to her. Their studio, Wayfarer, agreed to provide a full-time intimacy coordinator, bring in an outside producer and put other safeguards on set. In a side letter to Lively’s contract, signed by Heath, the studio also agreed not to retaliate against the actress.
But by August, the two men, who had positioned themselves as feminist allies in the #MeToo era, expressed fears that her allegations would become public and taint them, according to a legal complaint that she filed Friday. It claims that their PR effort had an explicit goal: to harm Lively’s reputation instead.
Her filing includes excerpts from thousands of pages of text messages and emails that she obtained through a subpoena. These and other documents were reviewed by The New York Times.
There have long been figures behind the scenes shaping public opinion about celebrities — through gossip columns, tabloids and strategic interviews. The documents show an additional playbook for waging a largely undetectable smear campaign in the digital era. Although the film, about domestic violence, was a box office hit — making nearly $350 million worldwide — online criticism of the actress skyrocketed.
“He wants to feel like she can be buried,” a publicist working with the studio and Baldoni wrote in an Aug. 2 message to the crisis management expert, Melissa Nathan.
“You know we can bury anyone,” Nathan wrote.
In the subsequent weeks, Nathan, whose clients have included actor Johnny Depp and rappers Drake and Travis Scott, went hard at the press, pushing to prevent stories about Baldoni’s behavior and reinforce negative ones about Lively, the text messages show. Jed Wallace, a self-described “hired gun,” led a digital strategy that included boosting social media posts that could help their cause.
An attorney for Wayfarer said in a statement to the Times that the studio, its executives and public relations representatives “did nothing proactive nor retaliated” against Lively, and accused the actress of “another desperate attempt to ‘fix’ her negative reputation.”
“These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,” wrote the lawyer, Bryan Freedman.
Freedman did not address her allegations about misconduct during the filming by Baldoni and Heath. He alleged that Lively planted “negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media” about Baldoni, which he said “was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional.”
The effort to tarnish Lively appears to have paid off. Within days of the film’s release, the negative media coverage and commentary became an unusually high percentage of her online presence, according to a forensic review she sought from a brand marketing consultant.
Lively — who is married to actor and entrepreneur Ryan Reynolds of “Deadpool” fame and is close with Taylor Swift — experienced the biggest reputational hit of her career. She was branded tone-deaf, difficult to work with, a bully. Sales of her new hair care line plummeted.
“Is Blake Lively set to be CANCELLED?” read a Daily Mail headline one week into the attacks.
Baldoni, by contrast, emerged largely unscathed. This month, he was honored at a star-studded event celebrating men who “elevate women, combat gender-based violence and promote gender equality worldwide.” On Saturday, however, after this article was published, the talent agency William Morris Endeavor stopped representing Baldoni, said Ari Emanuel, CEO of Endeavor, the agency’s parent company.
Lively’s complaint — against Baldoni; Heath; Wayfarer; Steve Sarowitz, co-founder of the studio; Wallace; Nathan; and Jennifer Abel, another public relations executive involved in the campaign — alleges sexual harassment and retaliation, among other claims. The complaint, filed with the California Civil Rights Department, is a precursor to a lawsuit.
In a statement, Lively said, “I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.”
She also denied that she or any of her representatives planted or spread negative information about Baldoni or Wayfarer.
‘We Should Have a Plan’
In May, several months after the filming wrapped, Baldoni realized that Reynolds had blocked him on Instagram.
“We should have a plan for IF she does the same when movie comes out,” Baldoni wrote of Lively in a text exchange that included Abel, a publicist who has long worked with him and Wayfarer. “Plans make me feel more at ease.”
Baldoni, 40, and Heath, 55, had a lot riding on the film, which is based on a bestselling novel by Colleen Hoover.
Baldoni was best known for The CW satirical romantic dramedy “Jane the Virgin.” Wayfarer provided the resources for bigger ambitions. It was bankrolled by billionaire Steve Sarowitz, co-chair of the studio with Baldoni. They and Heath, the CEO, are all deeply involved with the Baha’i religious organization, which promotes unity, peace and gender equality. Baldoni has presented himself as an ally to women, writing books, co-hosting a podcast with Heath and giving talks on toxic masculinity.
Lively, 37, was by far the bigger star. The TV show “Gossip Girl” catapulted her to early fame, and she appeared in films ranging from “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” to “The Town.” She built businesses outside the entertainment industry, appeared on the covers of glossy magazines and amassed more than 45 million Instagram followers.
Lively had expressed concerns about Baldoni from the beginning, according to her legal complaint. Before shooting began, for example, she objected to sex scenes he wanted to add that she considered gratuitous.
In November 2023, as the cast of “It Ends With Us” was preparing to resume shooting after a monthslong writers strike, Lively went to Wayfarer with the side letter seeking safeguards.
“Our client is willing to forego a more formal HR process in favor of everyone returning to work and finishing the Film as long as the set is safe moving forward,” her legal team wrote to the studio.
She detailed her complaints during a meeting with Baldoni, Heath and other producers in January, according to the legal filing. She claimed Baldoni had improvised unwanted kissing and discussed his sex life, including encounters in which he said he may not have received consent. Heath had shown her a video of his wife naked, she said, and he had watched Lively in her trailer when she was topless and having body makeup removed, despite her asking him to look away. She said that both men repeatedly entered her makeup trailer uninvited while she was undressed, including when she was breastfeeding.
In agreeing to the terms that Lively sought, Wayfarer acknowledged that “Although our perspective differs in many aspects, ensuring a safe environment for all is paramount,” according to her legal complaint.
By spring, Lively told people with whom she worked that the men’s behavior had improved with the new protections.
But she was now in a creative battle with them. With the support of Sony, the film’s distributor, she made her own cut of the movie, bringing in editors and a composer and adding one of Swift’s songs.
In the end, Sony and Wayfarer went with Lively’s cut, and she got a producer credit.
As the film release neared, Lively and other cast members informed Sony and Wayfarer that they would not do any appearances alongside Baldoni. So did Hoover, the author, who had her own dissatisfactions with him and had become more upset after he told her about Lively’s allegations, according to text messages from Baldoni and Heath.
‘Most Importantly Untraceable’
By the first week of August, Wayfarer and Baldoni had retained Nathan, who had worked with high-profile clients including Depp, whose ex-wife, Amber Heard, accused him of physical abuse.
Depp successfully sued Heard for defamation, and the trial became a spectacle amid suspicions of an online campaign to damage her credibility.
This year, after a decade at New York consultancy Hiltzik Strategies, Nathan started her own firm, TAG PR. Its majority stakeholder is a company run by entertainment industry executive Scooter Braun.
In an initial planning document sent to Wayfarer and Baldoni on Aug. 2, Nathan suggested media talking points, including that Lively used an imbalance of power to take creative control of the film.
But Baldoni wanted more.
“Not in love with the document they sent,” he responded in a text exchange that included Abel and Heath. “Not sure I’m feeling the protection I felt on the call.”
Abel relayed his frustration to Nathan: “I think you guys need to be tough and show the strength of what you guys can do in these scenarios. He wants to feel like she can be buried.”
“Of course- but you know when we send over documents we can’t send over the work we will or could do because that could get us in a lot of trouble,” Nathan responded, adding, “We can’t write we will destroy her.”
Moments later, she said, “Imagine if a document saying all the things that he wants ends up in the wrong hands.”
“You know we can bury anyone,” she wrote.
Three days later, Baldoni texted Abel, flagging a social media thread that accused another celebrity of bullying behavior and had generated 19 million views. “This is what we would need,” he wrote.
Nathan soon floated proposals to hire contractors to dominate social media through “full social account take downs,” by starting “threads of theories” and generally working to “change narrative.”
“All of this will be most importantly untraceable,” she wrote.
Within days, the group was working with Wallace, whose company, Street Relations, offers services ranging from public relations to more opaque crisis management. He is a somewhat enigmatic figure with very little digital trail. But court records show that his clients have included Paramount Pictures and YouTube personality Adin Ross.
And in a since-deleted LinkedIn profile, Wallace described himself as “a hired gun” with a “proprietary formula for defining artists and trends.”
‘That’s Why You Hired Me’
The Aug. 6 premiere brought the first wave of press coverage questioning what had happened during the filming. A Hollywood Reporter story speculated about a rift between Lively and Baldoni, after TikTokers noticed that the two stars didn’t pose for photographs together and that Lively and other cast members didn’t follow Baldoni on Instagram.
Nathan had already been speaking to other journalists, according to text messages.
When Abel on Aug. 4 wrote to her that “I’m having reckless thoughts of wanting to plant pieces this week of how horrible Blake is to work with. Just to get ahead of it,” Nathan replied that she had spoken off the record to an editor at The Daily Mail.
“She’s ready when we are,” Nathan wrote.
A flurry of articles followed the Hollywood Reporter piece. Many made it seem as if the only rift was over creative control. Some journalists had gotten wind of complaints about Baldoni’s behavior, but none of the most serious ones were published.
“He doesn’t realise how lucky he is right now,” Nathan texted Abel.
In other exchanges, Nathan claimed that she had kept allegations against him out of stories, writing in one message that major news outlets were “standing down on HR complaint.”
Meanwhile, an online backlash against Lively was underway. It is impossible to know how much of the negative publicity was seeded by Nathan, Wallace and their team, and how much they noticed and amplified.
On Aug. 10, Kjersti Flaa, a Norwegian entertainment reporter, uploaded to YouTube a 2016 interview in which Lively snapped back when Flaa commented on her baby “bump” and remained testy for the rest of the conversation. Flaa titled it “The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job,” and told The Daily Mail that “it’s time that people behaving badly in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter, gets called out for it.”
It wasn’t the first time she had posted a video aligned with a client of Nathan’s. In 2022, in the midst of Depp’s legal battle with Heard, Flaa posted clips of her interviews with the actor, tagged #JusticeForJohnnyDepp.
After publication of this article, Flaa on Sunday contacted the Times and said she had not participated in any orchestrated effort to harm Lively’s reputation. In an email, she said that she had resurfaced the 2016 interview independently this past August. “It was neither coordinated nor influenced by anyone associated with the alleged campaign,” she wrote.
During the film rollout, Lively was also accused of being insensitive about domestic violence. The official promotion plan instructed the cast to focus more on the uplifting aspects of the movie than on abuse, and to embrace a floral theme (her character has a flower shop). In several appearances, she never made reference to domestic violence at all. And she faced criticism when her Betty Booze beverage company was promoting the film, given the role alcohol can play in abusive relationships.
Seeing that blowback, the text messages show, Baldoni and his PR team decided instead to highlight survivors of domestic violence in his interviews and social media.
More criticism came when Lively said in an interview that Reynolds, who had no role in the film, had helped rewrite a scene, prompting snarky comments about the actress leaning on her husband and speculation that he had violated the writers strike.
It is unclear exactly how Wallace operated. There are references in emails to “social manipulation” and “proactive fan posting,” and text messages cite efforts to “boost” and “amplify” online content that was favorable to Baldoni or critical of Lively.
“We are crushing it on Reddit,” Wallace told Nathan, according to a text she sent Abel on Aug. 9.
The next day, one of Nathan’s employees texted, “We’ve started to see shift on social, due largely to Jed and his team’s efforts to shift the narrative.”
Nathan wrote to Abel: “And socials are really really ramping up. In his favour, she must be furious. It’s actually sad because it just shows you have people really want to hate on women.”
When a TikTok sleuth started asking questions about Baldoni, Abel texted that “this girl is on a very dangerous crusade.”
“We’ve flagged to Jed and his team for more serious action on the social side,” she wrote.
Throughout the text exchanges, Baldoni encourages the PR team, sometimes flagging social media posts for it to use. On Aug. 15, he proposes “flipping the narrative” on a positive story about Lively and her husband by “using their own words against them.”
Other times, he appears to vacillate, seeking assurances about the tactics being deployed.
When he notices a tabloid article critical of Lively, he sends a worried text: “How can we say somehow that we are not doing any of this — it looks like we are trying to take her down.” On another occasion, he wondered whether they were deploying fake “bot” accounts on social media.
“I can fully fully confirm we do not have bots,” Nathan wrote, adding that any digital team would be too intelligent to “utilise something so obvious.”
Wallace’s operation, she wrote, “is doing something very specific in terms of what they do. I know Jamey & Jed connected on this.”
Baldoni, Nathan and others on the team claimed in their text exchanges that Lively was using her own public relations team to create bad press about Baldoni but cited no evidence to support those claims.
By mid-August, the team was reveling in the damage to Lively’s image.
On Aug. 16, Nathan shared the Daily Mail article headlined “Is Blake Lively set to be CANCELLED?” with references to “hard to watch” videos and a “tone deaf” promotional Q&A.
“Wow. You really outdid yourself with this piece,” Abel responded.
“That’s why you hired me right?” Nathan replied. “I’m the best.”
‘We Men Have to Step Up’
A brand marketing consultant, Terakeet, produced a report in August for Lively that concluded she had probably been the object of a “targeted, multichannel online attack” similar to one against Heard, and that it was damaging her reputation.
The report did not identify who was behind the attack.
But by analyzing “the entirety of Google’s search index” for Lively’s name, it found that 35% of the results also included a reference to Baldoni. This was highly unusual given the length of her career, the company said, and suggested that the media environment was being manipulated.
A separate report, by Lively’s hair care company, Blake Brown, concluded that the social media onslaught also had a negative effect on that business. Her product line, which had launched in August with record-breaking sales, estimates that it lost as much as 78% in sales.
With the recent arrival of “It Ends With Us” on Netflix, Baldoni has begun another round of promotion and messaging.
In an interview on “Access Hollywood,” he said that “there is never an excuse” to “hurt a woman, physically or emotionally.” He added: “We men have to step up and figure out how we can be better allies.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For a clear glimpse into the evolving soul of modern country music, you could have done far worse than to travel to Charleston, W.Va., this fall to catch a stop on Jelly Roll's headlining arena tour.
Jelly Roll, a heavily tattooed former gangster rapper remade as a country-rock preacher, delivers bombastic, melodic songs about the desperation of addiction and the power of faith. His latest album, "Beautifully Broken," debuted atop the Billboard album chart in October.
His show is secular ministry -- "church for people that don't know they need church," he said earlier in the evening, picking at some hash browns with bacon in a green room backstage. The concert was also, in some stretches, a hip-hop show, nodding to the decade-long rap career that preceded his breakout, and the ways in which that fact is no longer the obstacle to mainstream country success than it once might have been.
In fact, the tour's whole lineup reflected that suddenly un-tense tension: The opening acts were Ernest, a writer of hit songs and an emerging star in his own right, who had an early career stretch as a rapper; and Shaboozey, perhaps the year's most striking country music breakout star, whose "A Bar Song (Tipsy)" -- a seamless and savvy hybrid of country and hip-hop, built around the structure of the 2004 hip-hop hit "Tipsy" by J-Kwon -- was rewarded with a record-tying 19 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100.
A common-man rock star, a classicist with an edgy past and an easeful genre hybridizer -- even a few years ago, one or more of these performers would have found country music's doors closed to them. In subtle but not insignificant ways, though, the genre is accepting the inevitability of evolution -- be it via performers who boldly engage with other genres, or via listeners whose consumption is more catholic than ever.
The curiosity is going both ways -- it has also been a year in which country culture has become palpably ubiquitous. For more than half the year, the top song in the Hot 100 was country, or notionally so. The superstars Beyoncé and Post Malone released albums celebrating their take on the genre. There were even cowboys on the runways of Louis Vuitton.
Last year at the Country Music Association Awards, Nashville's premiere honors, Jelly Roll won new artist of the year -- as close as that show comes to a left field choice. The victory actually left him with something to prove, he said, wondering if his tale of personal redemption, and the powerful and highly visible way he's passed that on to his fans, was what voters were rewarding. "I was worried if the new artist of the year was more story-driven than art-driven," he confessed. "As a creative person, that'll spiral you."
But this year, his rapid absorption into country was reaffirmed with a nomination for entertainer of the year, the CMAs' top prize -- an outrageous landing place for someone who arrived in the country music business through a side door.
"Three years ago I was looking at the country world and I thought by letting me in, it had become broader than it had ever been," Jelly Roll said. "And then I look at this year and I go, dude, it was still a PVC pipe back then. This is a full-blown tunnel now."
This year's outlier nominee for new artist of the year was Shaboozey -- one of the few Black performers ever to be so honored, and the only rapper. Though his success this year has been undeniable, he didn't win. He felt like he'd arrived at the right place, nevertheless -- where he was welcome, but boldly stood out.
"I love going to places where no one looks like you," he said, reflecting on the suddenness and size of his spotlight at a Mexican barbecue restaurant before that night's show. "I like being like a presence in a space."
"A Bar Song" was that and much more -- a year-defining song that bridged two worlds without significant concessions, the end result of more than five years of chipping away at his rap-infused country sound.
Country has been sniffing around hip-hop for inspiration for at least the past decade: "Cruise," the Florida Georgia Line single whose remix featuring Nelly became a megahit; Sam Hunt's genre-shifting "Montevallo" album; dalliances with rapping from genre stalwarts including Jason Aldean and Blake Shelton; and the relatively recent persistence of 808 drums in country songs, a simple gesture that's meant to almost unconsciously encode hip-hop tempo and texture.
It's an intriguing twist -- but perhaps not a coincidence? -- that the two songs with the longest runs atop the Hot 100 have both been country-rap hybrids released in the past five years. Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road" teetered between faithfulness and parody (more often tilting to the latter), and was treated largely like a nuisance by Nashville while dominating the pop zeitgeist. Whether because of the faithfulness of his approach, or a more welcoming spirit in the country music industry, Shaboozey has found more favor in Nashville.
His reverence for country is genuine -- at one point in the conversation, he assesses the lyrics of Marty Robbins's "Big Iron" through a gangster rap lens. But he also recalled listening to guitar-driven Atlanta rap in the late 2010s and struggling to understand, "Why's this not country?"
Even though he's perceived more as a country artist who raps than a straight-ahead rapper, Shaboozey said he's still navigating exactly where he'd like to stand moving forward.
"My producer, every time he has a 808 in the song, I'm like, you need take that out. And he's like, no, we need this," he said. "I'm trying to get to stripped-down, singer-songwriter stuff. But sometimes I'm learning like, man, that might not be my music."
The night before this year's CMAs, the producer Charlie Handsome was in his preferred room, The Cave at East Iris Studios in the Berry Hill section of Nashville. Perhaps more than anyone, he is responsible for the rapid evolution in country music's sonic attitude. In the 2010s, he cut his teeth making hip-hop songs with Young Thug, Kanye West, Kodak Black and others, and is now a primary architect of Morgan Wallen's sound.
Handsome's defining 2024 project was helping to craft "F-1 Trillion," the first country album by the cross-genre superstar Post Malone. It includes ample guest features from genre veterans (Brad Paisley, Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton) but, more crucially, a sound that finds common cause between Malone's older work and the new world he's seeking entree to.
In essence, Handsome is a translator, taking gestures from hip-hop and finding useful spots for them in country. Wallen was a natural partner. "He knows all the classic country records," Handsome said. "But if you hang out with Morgan pre-gaming for his shows, it's all rap. If you ride around in a truck with him, it's all rap.
"I feel like we had that in common in Ernest as well," Handsome continued, "And that's why we were able to understand the plan together."
Those two first hit it off at a Los Angeles studio session years ago. Ernest then invited Handsome to Nashville to collaborate on songs -- within the first few days of Handsome's arrival in town, they'd written "If I Know Me," the title track of Wallen's 2018 debut album.
Since, Handsome and Ernest have been two of the key players in the creative brain trust that has remade the sound of Nashville hits. Part of the reason Handsome moved to Nashville full-time in 2021 was to be closer to Wallen. "Since the first night I met him, I was like, he could be the biggest artist in country. I always thought that. So I was like, it just makes more sense to come here and spend more time on that."
Handsome doesn't consider himself part of Nashville's inner industry circle -- he sat for an interview as he was skipping out on the BMI Country Awards, where he was honored for co-writing the song of the year (Wallen's "Last Night"). Later that evening, Handsome headed to the storied dive bar Losers, which teemed with songwriters and executives (and Kid Rock), to catch up with Malone, who wore a long-sleeve camouflage shirt as he held court in a cordoned-off section, a welcome and easily absorbed addition to the scene's center of gravity.
The following afternoon, Ernest was getting dressed for the CMAs -- playfully groaning about having to buy the same pricey black Lucchese alligator boots multiple times -- and recalling the days before he and his collaborators were regular nominees.
"We were all broke together," he said of the early days writing alongside Wallen, Handsome and others. "Obviously schedules are more busy now, but when we're sitting down and writing a song, it's just three or four broke dudes trying to write a cool song."
One of those songs became "I Had Some Help," a collaboration between Malone and Wallen that had the longest run at the top of the Hot 100 this year of any song besides Shaboozey's.
Malone wanted something different from Handsome -- no 808s, no trap music -- a sound distinct from the one Handsome had been cultivating with Wallen. "He said, 'I feel like you guys are doing the new pop, but I want to do old country,"' Handsome recalled. (Malone is "a country music nerd," Jelly Roll insisted.)
Ernest's own music skews more classic country as well -- "Kenny Rogers, Glen Campbell, Merle Haggard -- I'm an old soul," he said. But as a professional songwriter, he's learned to be a creative assassin, writing in a variety of styles, a tool he said he honed freestyling when he focused more on rapping.
"The stuff that I used to write for fun when I was rapping, pulling up a Drake-style instrumental and write a song to that -- now I can do that and it ain't gotta be a joke," he said. "I can literally go write a Bon Jovi song by day and then BigXthaPlug at night."
During the pandemic, Ernest gained attention with an inside-country podcast on YouTube. On one episode he interviewed the storied songwriter Craig Wiseman about where he thought country music was headed. "Craig's answer was, wherever we send it," Ernest recalled. "At that time I was like, wow, to have that power. And I genuinely humbly feel like we have that power right now."
Looking around, all he sees are copycats. "I feel like a proud dad," he said, grinning. "I know a few of us guys who are expecting some Father's Day cards."
Wallen's One Night at a Time world tour -- the highest-grossing country tour ever -- concluded with a pair of sold-out shows at the Bank of America Stadium, home of the N.F.L.'s Carolina Panthers.
Wearing a pair of Travis Scott Air Jordan 1s, he performed two rollicking hours of country informed by hip-hop, pop and soul music. It was, in total, a coherent statement about the directions in which country music could be heading.
After the show, a few blocks away at the nightclub Trio, the country music DJ duo Vavo was getting prepared for its unofficial after-party.
It was Wallen who, indirectly, secured Vavo its big breakthrough: an edit of "Last Night," which quickly became a TikTok staple.
Vavo -- Jesse Fischer and Alden Martin -- has arrived at an optimal moment when edits, remixes and decontextualized trims are the coin of the realm on TikTok. A decade ago, you'd ask why there would ever be a club-friendly remix of a country song. Now it'd almost be preposterous if there wasn't one.
"There's only two artists I've ever cried when they passed -- one was Avicii and one was Toby Keith," said Fischer.
The duo signed a recording contract with Sony Music Nashville, and performed a brief preshow set at the Academy of Country Music Awards in May. They're releasing their own singles, but perhaps more crucially, they've been able to commercially release some of their remixes in partnership with the original performers, like Nate Smith and Thomas Rhett.
That owes to the group's effectiveness on social media, but also to a softening of the walls between genres in listening audiences. "You go back 10, 15 years and it was like, you either liked country or you didn't. There was no I'm-on-the-fence about it," Fischer said, noting that as a DJ, it was extremely limiting creatively. "Vegas was full of hip-hop, all these clubs were playing hip-hop. But if you were a country fan, you were almost outcast."
Once their post-Wallen set started, the through lines between country and dance began to reveal themselves plainly. Some songs, like Bailey Zimmerman's ecstatic "Religiously" were a natural fit in the format. Vavo delivered a melancholically thumping version of an Eric Church song that recalled the Chainsmokers. In places, they nodded to the hip-hop-friendly crossover country of the early 2010s: Big & Rich's "Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)," multiple songs by Florida Georgia Line. There was even an edit of Luke Combs's somber version of Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car," a song practically allergic to rhythm.
The set underscored the fact that country music has always been dance music, be it Western swing, or '80s power country, or even the earthen stomp-clap sound that suffused the indie rock-adjacent universe in the early 2010s courtesy of Mumford & Sons, the Lumineers and others.
A decade ago, Avicii -- then one of the most important dance music producers in the world -- imported that sound into his repertoire, collaborating with the singer Aloe Blacc and the multi-instrumentalist Dan Tyminski. He debuted the sound at the Ultra Music Festival in 2013, and was roundly booed.
Eventually, those songs became hits, and helped set the table for the flexibility that underpins country's current sound. This year, that same texture was part of what propelled "A Bar Song" to the top of the charts. The sound also recurs in another of the year's unlikely hits, "Stargazing," by the British singer Myles Smith, which refracts the style through a pop-EDM prism. It is notable, perhaps, that both Smith and Shaboozey are Black and got their start outside the country mainstream. Deploying the stomp-clap is a clever hack, a neat shorthand for tactile authenticity.
But what about Beyoncé?
That question lingered over country's breakthrough year, though it was asked largely by those on the outside looking in, reflecting anxiety about a huge cultural force operating just out of reach, or perhaps comprehension.
Despite its size, Nashville remains relatively cloistered -- it can often feel like a company town that only answers to itself. This could be felt even in the year of country's true cross-pollination into the cultural mainstream, when the high walls surrounding the music, and also the culture that comes with it, were buckling.
And yet the conversations around Beyoncé's "Cowboy Carter" indicated that the walls hadn't fully collapsed. "Cowboy Carter" was by no means the most commercially successful country album of the year, but it was almost certainly the most discoursed-about country album of the year. Though even if the light it cast on the country music business was a skeptical one, the power of having one of the most famous artists in the world engage with country music sound and ideology couldn't be undervalued.
"Beyoncé's album helped -- it was all for the betterment of country music, whether it was intended that way or not," Ernest said, adding that it, along with Malone's album, was likely to give a permanent boost to the genre's profile. "The needle has been moved so far this way that it'll never swing back as far as it was."
Beyoncé pointedly said before the album's release that it should be heard as a Beyoncé album, not a country album. Whatever the nomenclature, it is a parallel universe album of American roots music that asks what would happen if those modes, largely co-opted by white performers, were reinhabited by Black performers. A nothing-to-lose pop superstar serves as the anchor, surrounded and amplified by several rising talents in a range of approaches, from historical to edgy.
This intersection is one that Tanner Adell -- one of the featured Black country performers on "Cowboy Carter" -- has been boldly heading toward for the past few years.
She's best known for "Buckle Bunny," a salacious song about roping a hot cowboy -- "Lookin' like Beyoncé with a lasso," she quips. That was one of several singles she released over 2022 and 2023 that showed her to be a nimble combiner of sounds, a country star with pop gleam, hip-hop swagger and R&B sensuality.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, she found a following on TikTok before signing to a Nashville label. (They've since parted ways and she's now signed to LVRN, a Black-owned imprint, which she chose for its flexibility.) She's still committed to making country music -- in Nashville, she often works in a studio just next to Handsome's.
"I've never waited for an opportunity -- I go out and get what I want," she said backstage at the House of Blues in Cleveland, a few hours before a sold-out show. "What I was doing did not have a fan base. I had to work to acquire every single customer."
Her sophisticated but uncommon sound draws a more expansive audience than the usual country crowd: "It's diverse, it's all ages. It's all colors," she said. "It's young women who felt like they were like closeted Taylor Swift fans, and I'm that for them. I'm like a Black Taylor Swift to a lot of people. And they get to feel safe and enjoy it, and dress up and wear the cowboy hat."
In concert, Adell carried herself as if she were on an arena stage -- perfectly poised, decked out in an ornate denim outfit with multiple belts, singing with verve and cheek. Her show was severely modern, dexterous, at times raunchy, full of eminently quotable lines. It was a country show with creative ambition, learned but not limited.
She closed with "Buckle Bunny," which in this room was a shout-along anthem. The main part of the song is sinuous and slinky, but toward the end, her drummer shifted to a double-time train beat, reminiscent of the country music of several decades ago. Adell held her cowboy hat tight, kicked her high-heeled boots up in the air, and didn't miss a step. That tradition was hers, too.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The conductor Michael Tilson Thomas has always had a way with words, but one refrain of his is especially memorable.
"I have encouraged people to color outside the lines, for lack of a better analogy," he told The New York Times in 2017, in announcing his departure from the San Francisco Symphony after a quarter century as its lauded music director. "We're not trying to reproduce the notation here. We're trying to get back to the inspiration that caused the notations to exist."
Coloring outside the lines has been a way of life for Thomas, who, living with a terminal glioblastoma diagnosis from 2021, will turn 80 on Saturday. He has shown a certain freedom, a refusal to conform, a celebration of exuberance. Combined with a sprinkling of showmanship and a basic faith in the modern, these convictions have made Thomas, affectionately known as M.T.T., a crucial part of musical life for over five decades.
How has that philosophy fared on record? There's an argument that to ask the question at all is to somewhat miss the point. If Thomas has been anything, he has been a live musician, a man of the theater whose mind has feasted on the parallels and juxtapositions that tend to be much more possible in the concert hall than in the studio. Joshua Kosman, a longtime critic of The San Francisco Chronicle, recently noted that "it's the fleeting and protean quality of the event that corresponds, perhaps paradoxically, to M.T.T.'s deepest artistic commitments." Records, for better and for worse, last forever.
Even so, Thomas has been a dedicated, prolific, important recording artist, as a pair of new box sets that collect much of his legacy confirm. From Sony, there comes an 80-disc compendium of recordings he made for the Columbia, Sony and RCA labels, chiefly as the music director or principal conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic (1971-79), the London Symphony (1988-95), and the San Francisco Symphony (1995-2020). If the Sony set is a monument to the breadth of his interests, a 14-disc Eloquence compilation of Deutsche Grammophon and Argo releases is more of a diamond cut in his honor, sparkling with the precocity of his whiz-kid years with the Boston Symphony, and shining with the inquisitive enthusiasm of the young players of the New World Symphony, which he founded in 1987.
Add his many recordings for the San Francisco Symphony's own label and others, many of which remain widely available, as well as "Grace," a four-disc tribute to his compositions that was recently released by Pentatone to benefit brain cancer research, and we now have as full a picture of Thomas preserved in sound as we are ever likely to have. And his traits emerge with striking fidelity.
Thomas's discography is as notable for what it includes as for how well it is typically conducted. In "Viva Voce," a 1994 book of conversations with the journalist Edward Seckerson, Thomas noted that record companies used to have certain requirements of conductors, namely that they would do the Beethoven, Brahms and Mahler symphonies, a bit of Wagner, maybe some French music. "There are, what, 70 or 90 pieces you're expected to do," he said.
Indeed, he has recorded many of those pieces, but he has succeeded remarkably well at shifting the focus elsewhere. There was a bold early Beethoven survey, mostly with the English Chamber Orchestra, which shows its age now that performance styles have evolved, and a celebrated Mahler cycle in San Francisco that probably never will. There is excellent Berlioz and ample, often unusual Tchaikovsky. Some composers appear in strange, if welcome guises, like Brahms, who is represented by his serenades rather than by his symphonies. Others are conspicuously quiet, like Haydn, Mozart, Bruckner and Sibelius.
Thomas's achievement instead has been to fashion a repertoire for himself, one anchored much more firmly in the 20th century than the 19th or 18th, and far closer to home. Beethoven is still there, as are Mahler and Strauss, Debussy and Ravel. Stravinsky takes a starring role. But American music truly shines. Gershwin and Ives have been the twin poles of Thomas's American Century, and around them have come Ruggles, Copland, Bernstein, Feldman, Adams and more. Few of these men can have hoped for more committed or more persuasive readings than Thomas has given them over the years.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
GROWING UP in an intellectual Los Angeles household, and as an only child, Thomas had an astonishingly broad range of influences: his grandmother Bessie Thomashefsky, a founding light of American Yiddish theater; Jascha Heifetz and Gregor Piatigorsky, the superstars he accompanied at the University of Southern California; Stravinsky and Boulez, titans among the composers he performed as the pianist and conductor of the city's Monday Evening Concerts; Ingolf Dahl, the teacher who taught him that enjoyment and analysis were one and the same.
By the time Thomas joined the Boston Symphony at 24, as its assistant conductor, he was saturated in music and full of ideas. "Let me say simply that right now he is one of the ablest and most interesting conductors in the profession," the critic Michael Steinberg wrote after a 1969 debut in works by Haydn, Ives, Stravinsky and Debussy. "It was what I dreamed conducting would be like," Thomas recalled. The hype burned nuclear, as this tyro with "more ideas about programming than an IBM systems man," as one writer smirked, put Perotin, Stockhausen and Schumann on the same bill, then nearly caused a riot with Reich's "Four Organs" at Carnegie Hall. "I don't fling the word genius around lightly," Bernstein, a friend, told The Times, "but I fling it at Michael."
Opinions flowed torrentially from Thomas in those years, and some became abiding principles. From the start, he was determined to be an explorer and an advocate, in addition to being a performer -- and a teacher, too. He talked so eagerly from the Symphony Hall stage in Boston that a trustee once yelled at him to shut up; he was more cogent by the time he made his series of "Keeping Score" documentaries in San Francisco.
He also believed that orchestras could and should be more than they had become. "All this talk about favorite performances is bad," he said in 1971, decrying the impulse -- reinforced by recordings -- that originality in interpretation was suspect, that there was "only the permissible mean deviation between the Toscanini version and the Furtwängler." He preferred the model of repertory theater. "There the most important thing is not how like the last time this performance was, but how different, and in what ways," he added. He kept the comparison in mind throughout his career.
If Thomas's first recordings offer a declaration of intent, they also bear out his reputation. Who else could have taped a thoroughly entertaining set of Gershwin's Broadway overtures on the same day as parts of a Ruggles survey, as he did in Buffalo in 1976 -- let alone do so with such an exact sense of style? Who else might have trusted enough in "The American Flag," a forgotten Dvorak cantata, not only to unearth it, but also perform it so zealously? Who else could have dared make his first Beethoven album an exploration of late choral works? The Boston Symphony recordings are particularly special, renowned as classics for good reason: the bracing expressivity of his Ruggles "Sun-Treader," the songful abandon of his Piston Second Symphony. Rarely has "The Rite of Spring" sounded so lyrical, so gleeful. God, how those musicians played for him.
IN AN ESSAY with the new Sony set, Thomas offers a guide to some of his prouder achievements on record, and his selections largely make sense. His complete set of Ives with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, offering the first recordings of the critical editions of the scores, remains an indispensable introduction to that composer; the restless quality of Thomas's intelligence makes an ideal match for the contrasts and clashes of a great radical. It's impossible not to fall for his Gershwin, whether the three accounts of the "Rhapsody in Blue," including one with the composer's own piano rolls, or the piano miniatures that Thomas plays himself. All of Thomas's Stravinsky rewards hearing, especially a blistering San Francisco take on the "Rite."
Throughout, there is little suggestion that Thomas is around only to follow a score, still less to impose himself on the notes rather than find the spirit between them. "I'm not going to stand on the podium and say, 'I am the way, the truth and life,"' he explained in 1984. "There is no such person. And I have become accustomed to people either liking or disliking what I do. It's never just a nice, perfunctory performance. That's not what my work is about. It's either revelation or desecration, depending on your point of view."
If that is not especially apparent in many of Thomas's studio efforts, it is truer of the live recordings he made in San Francisco, in which his constant search for meaning and his willingness to be emotionally frank can work both ways. Slow movements, for example, are frequently pushed to their breaking point: Sometimes they come off, as in the gut punch of a Mahler Sixth he set down just days after Sept. 11, and sometimes they do not, as in a turgid finale of Tchaikovsky's "Pathétique" Symphony. The highs are extraordinary, among them a crushing Mahler Ninth, stylish excerpts from Prokofiev "Romeo and Juliet," and a rampant disc of Cowell, Harrison and Varèse. The lows, like a Schumann cycle, are a real slog.
Maybe it's apt, given Thomas's taste for upending expectations, that some of the most unusual of his recordings turn out to be among his most appealing. In the Eloquence set, there is a New World Symphony disc called "Tangazo," a collection of Latin American music that is played with breathtaking rhythmic confidence and plenty of bite. The Sony box has an atmospheric disc of Villa-Lobos. A San Francisco box of jewels, "Masterpieces in Miniature," is downright lovely, Delius and all.
"I never thought I would record Adam's 'Giselle,"' Thomas writes of that ballet score. I never thought I would love it so much.
It's in recordings like these that you best hear one last characteristic of Thomas's work. In an elegy for Bernstein, to whom he has so often been compared, he once wrote: "There was never any question of what he believed, what he championed. It was the joy of music. He lived it."
You might say the same of Thomas, too.

Country music has long been a genre that largely lived apart from the rest of popular culture. But this year felt like a crossover moment unlike any before. A New York Times critic hit the road to see the phenomenon up close and to understand why country music was inescapable in 2024.
NOV. 1
Country Outsiders at the Core
CHARLESTON, W.Va. — For a clear glimpse into the evolving soul of modern country music, you could have done far worse than to travel to West Virginia this fall to catch a stop on Jelly Roll’s headlining arena tour.
Jelly Roll, a heavily tattooed former gangster rapper remade as a country-rock preacher, delivers bombastic, melodic songs about the desperation of addiction and the power of faith. His latest album, “Beautifully Broken,” debuted atop the Billboard album chart in October.
His show is secular ministry — “church for people that don’t know they need church,” he said earlier in the evening, picking at some hash browns with bacon in a green room backstage. The concert was also, in some stretches, a hip-hop show, nodding to the decade-long rap career that preceded his breakout, and the ways in which that fact is no longer the obstacle to mainstream country success than it once might have been.
In fact, the tour’s whole lineup reflected that suddenly un-tense tension: The opening acts were Ernest, a writer of hit songs and an emerging star in his own right, who had an early career stretch as a rapper; and Shaboozey, perhaps the year’s most striking country music breakout star, whose “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” — a seamless and savvy hybrid of country and hip-hop, built around the structure of the 2004 hip-hop hit “Tipsy” by J-Kwon — was rewarded with a record-tying 19 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100.
A common-man rock star, a classicist with an edgy past and an easeful genre hybridizer — even a few years ago, one or more of these performers would have found country music’s doors closed to them. In subtle but not insignificant ways, though, the genre is accepting the inevitability of evolution — be it via performers who boldly engage with other genres, or via listeners whose consumption is more catholic than ever.
The curiosity is going both ways — it has also been a year in which country culture has become palpably ubiquitous. For more than half the year, the top song in the Hot 100 was country, or notionally so. The superstars Beyoncé and Post Malone released albums celebrating their take on the genre. There were even cowboys on the runways of Louis Vuitton.
Last year at the Country Music Association Awards, Nashville’s premiere honors, Jelly Roll won new artist of the year — as close as that show comes to a left field choice. The victory actually left him with something to prove, he said, wondering if his tale of personal redemption, and the powerful and highly visible way he’s passed that on to his fans, was what voters were rewarding. “I was worried if the new artist of the year was more story-driven than art-driven,” he confessed. “As a creative person, that’ll spiral you.”
But this year, his rapid absorption into country was reaffirmed with a nomination for entertainer of the year, the CMAs’ top prize — an outrageous landing place for someone who arrived in the country music business through a side door.
“Three years ago I was looking at the country world and I thought by letting me in, it had become broader than it had ever been,” Jelly Roll said. “And then I look at this year and I go, dude, it was still a PVC pipe back then. This is a full-blown tunnel now.”
This year’s outlier nominee for new artist of the year was Shaboozey — one of the few Black performers ever to be so honored, and the only rapper. Although his success this year has been undeniable, he didn’t win. He felt like he’d arrived at the right place, nevertheless — where he was welcome, but boldly stood out.
“I love going to places where no one looks like you,” he said, reflecting on the suddenness and size of his spotlight at a Mexican barbecue restaurant before that night’s show. “I like being like a presence in a space.”
“A Bar Song” was that and much more — a year-defining song that bridged two worlds without significant concessions, the end result of more than five years of chipping away at his rap-infused country sound.
Country has been sniffing around hip-hop for inspiration for at least the past decade: “Cruise,” the Florida Georgia Line single whose remix featuring Nelly became a megahit; Sam Hunt’s genre-shifting “Montevallo” album; dalliances with rapping from genre stalwarts including Jason Aldean and Blake Shelton; and the relatively recent persistence of 808 drums in country songs, a simple gesture that’s meant to almost unconsciously encode hip-hop tempo and texture.
It’s an intriguing twist — but perhaps not a coincidence? — that the two songs with the longest runs atop the Hot 100 have both been country-rap hybrids released in the past five years. Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” teetered between faithfulness and parody (more often tilting to the latter), and was treated largely like a nuisance by Nashville while dominating the pop zeitgeist. Whether because of the faithfulness of his approach, or a more welcoming spirit in the country music industry, Shaboozey has found more favor in Nashville.
His reverence for country is genuine — at one point in the conversation, he assesses the lyrics of Marty Robbins’ “Big Iron” through a gangster rap lens. But he also recalled listening to guitar-driven Atlanta rap in the late 2010s and struggling to understand, “Why’s this not country?”
Even though he’s perceived more as a country artist who raps than a straight-ahead rapper, Shaboozey said he’s still navigating exactly where he’d like to stand moving forward.
“My producer, every time he has a 808 in the song, I’m like, you need take that out. And he’s like, no, we need this,” he said. “I’m trying to get to stripped-down, singer-songwriter stuff. But sometimes I’m learning like, man, that might not be my music.”
NOV. 19-20
Fathering a Rap-Infused Sound
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The night before this year’s CMAs, producer Charlie Handsome was in his preferred room, The Cave at East Iris Studios in the Berry Hill section of Nashville. Perhaps more than anyone, he is responsible for the rapid evolution in country music’s sonic attitude. In the 2010s, he cut his teeth making hip-hop songs with Young Thug, Kanye West, Kodak Black and others, and is now a primary architect of Morgan Wallen’s sound.
Handsome’s defining 2024 project was helping to craft “F-1 Trillion,” the first country album by the cross-genre superstar Post Malone. It includes ample guest features from genre veterans (Brad Paisley, Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton) but, more crucially, a sound that finds common cause between Malone’s older work and the new world he’s seeking entree to.
In essence, Handsome is a translator, taking gestures from hip-hop and finding useful spots for them in country. Wallen was a natural partner. “He knows all the classic country records,” Handsome said. “But if you hang out with Morgan pre-gaming for his shows, it’s all rap. If you ride around in a truck with him, it’s all rap.
“I feel like we had that in common in Ernest as well,” Handsome continued, ”And that’s why we were able to understand the plan together.”
Those two first hit it off at a Los Angeles studio session years ago. Ernest then invited Handsome to Nashville to collaborate on songs — within the first few days of Handsome’s arrival in town, they’d written “If I Know Me,” the title track of Wallen’s 2018 debut album.
Since, Handsome and Ernest have been two of the key players in the creative brain trust that has remade the sound of Nashville hits. Part of the reason Handsome moved to Nashville full-time in 2021 was to be closer to Wallen. “Since the first night I met him, I was like, he could be the biggest artist in country. I always thought that. So I was like, it just makes more sense to come here and spend more time on that.”
Handsome doesn’t consider himself part of Nashville’s inner industry circle — he sat for an interview as he was skipping out on the BMI Country Awards, where he was honored for co-writing the song of the year (Wallen’s “Last Night”). Later that evening, Handsome headed to the storied dive bar Losers, which teemed with songwriters and executives (and Kid Rock), to catch up with Malone, who wore a long-sleeve camouflage shirt as he held court in a cordoned-off section, a welcome and easily absorbed addition to the scene’s center of gravity.
The following afternoon, Ernest was getting dressed for the CMAs — playfully groaning about having to buy the same pricey black Lucchese alligator boots multiple times — and recalling the days before he and his collaborators were regular nominees.
“We were all broke together,” he said of the early days writing alongside Wallen, Handsome and others. “Obviously schedules are more busy now, but when we’re sitting down and writing a song, it’s just three or four broke dudes trying to write a cool song.”
One of those songs became “I Had Some Help,” a collaboration between Malone and Wallen that had the longest run at the top of the Hot 100 this year of any song besides Shaboozey’s.
Malone wanted something different from Handsome — no 808s, no trap music — a sound distinct from the one Handsome had been cultivating with Wallen. “He said, ‘I feel like you guys are doing the new pop, but I want to do old country,’” Handsome recalled. (Malone is “a country music nerd,” Jelly Roll insisted.)
Ernest’s own music skews more classic country as well — “Kenny Rogers, Glen Campbell, Merle Haggard — I’m an old soul,” he said. But as a professional songwriter, he’s learned to be a creative assassin, writing in a variety of styles, a tool he said he honed freestyling when he focused more on rapping.
“The stuff that I used to write for fun when I was rapping, pulling up a Drake-style instrumental and write a song to that — now I can do that and it ain’t gotta be a joke,” he said. “I can literally go write a Bon Jovi song by day and then BigXthaPlug at night.”
During the pandemic, Ernest gained attention with an inside-country podcast on YouTube. On one episode he interviewed storied songwriter Craig Wiseman about where he thought country music was headed. “Craig’s answer was, wherever we send it,” Ernest recalled. “At that time I was like, wow, to have that power. And I genuinely humbly feel like we have that power right now.”
Looking around, all he sees are copycats. “I feel like a proud dad,” he said, grinning. “I know a few of us guys who are expecting some Father’s Day cards.”
OCT. 18
From the Stadium to the Club
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Morgan Wallen’s One Night at a Time world tour — the highest-grossing country tour ever — concluded with a pair of sold-out shows at the Bank of America Stadium, home of the NFL’s Carolina Panthers.
Wearing a pair of Travis Scott Air Jordan 1s, he performed two rollicking hours of country informed by hip-hop, pop and soul music. It was, in total, a coherent statement about the directions in which country music could be heading.
After the show, a few blocks away at the nightclub Trio, the country music DJ duo Vavo was getting prepared for its unofficial after-party.
It was Wallen who, indirectly, secured Vavo its big breakthrough: an edit of “Last Night,” which quickly became a TikTok staple.
Vavo — Jesse Fischer and Alden Martin — has arrived at an optimal moment when edits, remixes and decontextualized trims are the coin of the realm on TikTok. A decade ago, you’d ask why there would ever be a club-friendly remix of a country song. Now it’d almost be preposterous if there wasn’t one.
“There’s only two artists I’ve ever cried when they passed — one was Avicii and one was Toby Keith,” said Fischer.
The duo signed a recording contract with Sony Music Nashville, and performed a brief preshow set at the Academy of Country Music Awards in May. They’re releasing their own singles, but perhaps more crucially, they’ve been able to commercially release some of their remixes in partnership with the original performers, including Nate Smith and Thomas Rhett.
That owes to the group’s effectiveness on social media, but also to a softening of the walls between genres in listening audiences. “You go back 10, 15 years and it was like, you either liked country or you didn’t. There was no I’m-on-the-fence about it,” Fischer said, noting that as a DJ, it was extremely limiting creatively. “Vegas was full of hip-hop, all these clubs were playing hip-hop. But if you were a country fan, you were almost outcast.”
Once their post-Wallen set started, the through lines between country and dance began to reveal themselves plainly. Some songs, such as Bailey Zimmerman’s ecstatic “Religiously,” were a natural fit in the format. Vavo delivered a melancholically thumping version of an Eric Church song that recalled the Chainsmokers. In places, they nodded to the hip-hop-friendly crossover country of the early 2010s: Big & Rich’s “Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy),” multiple songs by Florida Georgia Line. There was even an edit of Luke Combs’ somber version of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car,” a song practically allergic to rhythm.
The set underscored the fact that country music has always been dance music, be it Western swing, or ’80s power country, or even the earthen stomp-clap sound that suffused the indie rock-adjacent universe in the early 2010s courtesy of Mumford & Sons, the Lumineers and others.
A decade ago, Avicii — then one of the most important dance music producers in the world — imported that sound into his repertoire, collaborating with singer Aloe Blacc and multi-instrumentalist Dan Tyminski. He debuted the sound at the Ultra Music Festival in 2013, and was roundly booed.
Eventually, those songs became hits, and helped set the table for the flexibility that underpins country’s current sound. This year, that same texture was part of what propelled “A Bar Song” to the top of the charts. The sound also recurs in another of the year’s unlikely hits, “Stargazing,” by British singer Myles Smith, which refracts the style through a pop-EDM prism. It is notable, perhaps, that both Smith and Shaboozey are Black and got their start outside the country mainstream. Deploying the stomp-clap is a clever hack, a neat shorthand for tactile authenticity.

Beyond ‘Cowboy Carter’
CLEVELAND — But what about Beyoncé?
That question lingered over country’s breakthrough year, though it was asked largely by those on the outside looking in, reflecting anxiety about a huge cultural force operating just out of reach, or perhaps comprehension.
Despite its size, Nashville remains relatively cloistered — it can often feel like a company town that only answers to itself. This could be felt even in the year of country’s true cross-pollination into the cultural mainstream, when the high walls surrounding the music, and also the culture that comes with it, were buckling.
And yet the conversations around Beyoncé’s “Cowboy Carter” indicated that the walls hadn’t fully collapsed. “Cowboy Carter” was by no means the most commercially successful country album of the year, but it was almost certainly the most discoursed-about country album of the year. Though even if the light it cast on the country music business was a skeptical one, the power of having one of the most famous artists in the world engage with country music sound and ideology couldn’t be undervalued.
“Beyoncé’s album helped — it was all for the betterment of country music, whether it was intended that way or not,” Ernest said, adding that it, along with Post Malone’s album, was likely to give a permanent boost to the genre’s profile. “The needle has been moved so far this way that it’ll never swing back as far as it was.”
Beyoncé pointedly said before the album’s release that it should be heard as a Beyoncé album, not a country album. Whatever the nomenclature, it is a parallel universe album of American roots music that asks what would happen if those modes, largely co-opted by white performers, were reinhabited by Black performers. A nothing-to-lose pop superstar serves as the anchor, surrounded and amplified by several rising talents in a range of approaches, from historical to edgy.
This intersection is one that Tanner Adell — one of the featured Black country performers on “Cowboy Carter” — has been boldly heading toward for the past few years.
She’s best known for “Buckle Bunny,” a salacious song about roping a hot cowboy — “Lookin’ like Beyoncé with a lasso,” she quips. That was one of several singles she released over 2022 and 2023 that showed her to be a nimble combiner of sounds, a country star with pop gleam, hip-hop swagger and R&B sensuality.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, she found a following on TikTok before signing to a Nashville label. (They’ve since parted ways and she’s now signed to LVRN, a Black-owned imprint, which she chose for its flexibility.) She’s still committed to making country music — in Nashville, she often works in a studio just next to Handsome’s.
“I’ve never waited for an opportunity — I go out and get what I want,” she said backstage at the House of Blues in Cleveland, a few hours before a sold-out show. “What I was doing did not have a fan base. I had to work to acquire every single customer.”
Her sophisticated but uncommon sound draws a more expansive audience than the usual country crowd: “It’s diverse, it’s all ages. It’s all colors,” she said. “It’s young women who felt like they were like closeted Taylor Swift fans, and I’m that for them. I’m like a Black Taylor Swift to a lot of people. And they get to feel safe and enjoy it, and dress up and wear the cowboy hat.”
In concert, Adell carried herself as if she were on an arena stage — perfectly poised, decked out in an ornate denim outfit with multiple belts, singing with verve and cheek. Her show was severely modern, dexterous, at times raunchy, full of eminently quotable lines. It was a country show with creative ambition, learned but not limited.
She closed with “Buckle Bunny,” which in this room was a shout-along anthem. The main part of the song is sinuous and slinky, but toward the end, her drummer shifted to a double-time train beat, reminiscent of the country music of several decades ago. Adell held her cowboy hat tight, kicked her high-heeled boots up in the air, and didn’t miss a step. That tradition was hers, too.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An esteemed Spanish actress, she was best known for her work in Pedro Almodóvar's movies like "All About My Mother." But their relationship was stormy.
Marisa Paredes, an award-winning actress who was considered one of the great divas of Spanish film, gaining international acclaim for her work with the renowned director Pedro Almodóvar, died on Tuesday in Madrid. She was 78.
Her death was announced by the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences of Spain. She was president of the academy from 2000 to 2003.
The news and culture site Hola! reported that Ms. Paredes had been feeling ill early on Tuesday and was admitted to a Madrid hospital, accompanied by her partner, the filmmaker Chema Prado.
Appearing in more than 75 films since 1960, Ms. Paredes was known for her mischievous comedic touch and an ability to mine the depths of her characters -- "strong, ambivalent, torn, passionate, enigmatic and ultimately very human women," as the academy described them in a statement.
While her early films and her many appearances on Spanish television received little attention outside her native country, Ms. Paredes eventually made waves internationally, appearing in Roberto Benigni's "Life Is Beautiful," a 1997 film that won three Academy Awards. She played the mother-in-law of Mr. Benigni's character, who attempts to survive on humor and imagination after he and his son are sent to a German concentration camp during World War II.
She also drew praise for her role as Carmen, a stoic leftist teacher with a wooden leg who struggles to survive at a boarding school in the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's "The Devil's Backbone," a 2001 horror-tinged film set during the Spanish Civil War.
But she was best known internationally for her roles in several films by Mr. Almodóvar, widely hailed as Spain's greatest living filmmaker.
Their working relationship began in 1983 with "Dark Habits," a the black comedy about a nightclub singer running from the law who takes refuge in a convent populated by nuns with a taste for soft-core pornographic literature and drugs. (Their motto is "Sin is our chosen path.") Ms. Paredes played Sister Manure, the resident psychedelics aficionado.
While her decades-long collaboration with Mr. Almodóvar was mutually beneficial, it was not without its complications -- in part, because of Ms. Paredes's acting process. As Mel Gussow wrote in 2001 in The New York Times, "Whatever the movie, Ms. Paredes is known for besieging her director with questions: 'Why do I do that? Where do I come from? Why do I think those thoughts? And what kind of books would my character read?"'
The demanding Mr. Almodóvar also bore some responsibility for their choppy relationship, which included an extended period of not speaking to each other. A 1996 profile of Ms. Paredes in The Guardian noted that the director looked "like a petulant boy" and was "renowned for living up to the description on set."
"He says that I asked too many questions; I was a little too mouthy, a little too arrogant," Ms. Paredes told The Guardian. "He said that I didn't deliver myself fully, that I insisted on rationalizing what I was doing. Not something he liked. And he was right. I'm a very methodical actress, a little too concerned about the whys and wherefores of things."
Regardless, she was one of Mr. Almodóvar's most valued collaborators, playing what Mr. Gussow described as "sexy, openhearted women with strong creative instincts." They included onetime pop star in "High Heels" (1992), a popular romance novelist in "The Flower of My Secret" (1995) and a celebrated actress in "All About My Mother" (1999).
Later, Ms. Paredes appeared in Mr. Almodóvar's 2011 thriller "The Skin I Live In," turning in a "spikily human, funny" performance, Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times, as the fanatically loyal housekeeper of a wealthy, deranged plastic surgeon (Antonio Banderas).
In the Guardian interview, Ms. Paredes discussed why much of her work had failed to travel beyond Spain. "I was offered the most unexpected films," she said. "I did them because they interested me artistically. Filmmaking for its own sake never interested me, and the same goes for being a film star."
She added: "I have not been offered many commercial films, but then I don't really fit the girl-next-door-let's-see-what-happens-to-her roles ... until Almodóvar turned up and turned me into a chica Almodóvar."
María Luisa Paredes Bartolomé was born on April 3, 1946, in Madrid. Growing up near the city's famous Teatro Español, she developed an early interest in acting.
In 1960, when she was 14, she made her film debut in "091, Policía al habla" ("Police Calling 091"). Three years later, she was cast in "El mundo sigue" ("Life Goes On"), by the Spanish actor, director and writer Fernando Fernán Gómez. A merciless drama about poverty and other hardships under the authoritarian Franco regime, the movie was not released until 1965 because of government censorship. It was later hailed as a classic.
Other notable films include "Las bicicletas son para el verano" ("Bicycles Are for the Summer"), a 1984 family drama set during the Spanish Civil War and directed by Jaime Chávarri, and "Tras el cristal" ("In a Glass Cage"), a transgressive psychological film from 1986 by Agustí Villaronga, in which she played the wife of a former Nazi doctor and pedophile confined to an iron lung.
Ms. Paredes had a daughter, María Isasi, in the 1970s with the filmmaker Antonio Isasi-Isasmendi, who died in 2017. Ms. Isasi is now an actress. Information on other survivors was not immediately available.
Ms. Paredes received the National Film Award from the Spanish Ministry of Culture in 1996 and an honorary Goya Award from the Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences in 2018.
"This profession," she said in an interview around the time she received her Goya Award, calls for "absolute rigor and seriousness."
She added: "It requires dedication, courage, strength -- not being defeated by discouragement."

An Unpredictable Actress Surprises Anew: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The actress Jessica Harper was first profiled in The Times on Aug. 19, 1977. The occasion was the release of the Italian horror film "Suspiria," and much was made of the fact that she had turned down a small role in Woody Allen's "Annie Hall." She explained, "I would have loved to do 'Annie Hall' but this was a big role and it meant going to Rome. I couldn't pass it up, but I don't know if it was a wise choice."
And so, in a video conversation with Harper about her new film, "Nightbitch," I had the rare opportunity to ask a 47-years-later follow-up question: was it, in fact, a wise choice? "More than wise, it was a brilliant choice," she said with a laugh. "'Suspiria' turned out to be what I think is a gorgeous movie in its genre, and I'm really proud to be in it -- and quite amazed, and yet not entirely surprised, by its long, long, long-term success."
"Suspiria" was a game-changer for Harper twice -- first in 1977, when it confirmed her as one of the most charismatic yet unpredictable actors of her generation, and then again in 2018, when Luca Guadagnino remade the film and offered Harper her first major role in a feature film in 16 years. "I felt really lucky to be able to have an opportunity to jump back in," she said cheerfully, adding, "He's such a wild, mad, creative person, and I love working with him." But even more, she was eager to "go back to Italy and step back into bigger features than I had been focusing on for a long time."
Those include "Nightbitch," about a mother, played by Amy Adams, who finds herself growing feral as she copes with her decision to stay at home with her husband, who's often absent. Adams, also a producer on the film, said Harper had "this great sort of grounded mysticism that I thought was really beautiful," explaining that the veteran brought "a wisdom" to the film. She added, "The relationship became very clear when she got onto set. And I always love that, when you're working with an actor, and you have it on the page, and you're exploring what that relationship means."
Harper's hiatus from the big screen was mostly by choice, stepping out of the spotlight to get married and raise a family, though she took pains to keep her creative muscles in shape. "I wrote a dozen children's books and created several albums of family music," she said. "So I found other outlets for creativity." But she would not have imagined that kind of self-imposed exile when she began acting in 1969, as part of the company of "Hair."
She came from a big Midwestern family (detailed in her delightful and thoughtful memoir podcast, "Winnetka"), one of six children born to conservative parents. "You wouldn't think that they would be the kind of people who would applaud their daughter when she got a role on Broadway, appearing naked in front of 700 people eight shows a week," she said with a chuckle, "but it was actually my mother who suggested that I try out for that show" after seeing an article in The Times.
She followed that up with an Off Broadway hit, "Dr. Selavy's Magic Theater," that drew rave reviews and theatergoers like Brian De Palma.
The up-and-coming director was casting for his gonzo horror musical comedy "Phantom of the Paradise," and he wanted Harper to audition for the role of the ingénue. Despite never having appeared in a film before, Harper won the part (over such competitors as Linda Ronstadt), and found herself thrust into a chaotic production. "They say, 'Hit your marks,"' she recalled. "Then they say, 'Look camera left.' I'm going, 'Whose left? Your left, or my left?' I didn't know anything." She learned quickly. Her electrifying work in "Phantom" caught the eye of the Italian genre maestro Dario Argento, who offered her the lead in "Suspiria."
"I kind of loved it," she confessed, "because, especially at that time in my life, I wasn't really scared of anything. I was not risk averse, and so everything in life was a welcome adventure -- particularly going to this strange city, and nobody on the crew, or very few, spoke English."
So she learned some Italian, and "I remember at a certain point, just becoming entirely comfortable with what I was doing." That confidence carried her through the next several years, as she continued to work with boundary-breaking directors in risky but rewarding projects.
But as the '80s dawned, something changed for Harper, and it wasn't just the studios (and the culture) becoming more conservative. After she co-starred with Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters in "Pennies From Heaven," a downbeat Depression-era musical, and she recalled that after that film opened, "going home in a limousine by myself to my little house in Laurel Canyon, I thought, 'You know, I need to populate my life a little better.' I really got to that age where I wanted to zero in on making a family."
In 1989 she married Tom Rothman, now the chairman of Sony Pictures, and had two children pretty rapidly. "That changed life radically, obviously," she said.
She didn't stop acting altogether, "but it was more local stuff and television, and not as many features, which generally require that you travel to Yugoslavia or someplace." There were occasional showcase roles ("Safe" for Todd Haynes in 1995 was one; Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report" in 2002 was another), "but for many years, I was, shall we say, struggling with the work-motherhood balance" -- as Amy Adams's character is in "Nightbitch."
She wanted to be closer to her daughters and didn't want to travel. However, she found ways to combine family and art, most notably by writing children's books (some of which are illustrated by her sister, Lindsay Harper duPont.) "It just became a way to satisfy the creative drive while kind of involving my children in the process," she said. Now that her girls are grown, she's been able to indulge in a wider array of projects; she wrote, edited and narrated the "Winnetka" podcast, penned a cookbook and just completed a memoir prompted by the time she spent with her family during the Covid lockdown.
And now she's acting again. After "Suspiria," Guadagnino cast her in his follow-up film, "Bones and All." Last year, she turned up in the indie drama "Memory"; she's appeared in multiple episodes of the series "See," "Fatal Attraction," and "The Old Man."
"I'm happy to say that more unusual movies have found me, and I have found them," she said, adding, "I feel as though there's always something groundbreaking and fun going on." For "Nightbitch" -- in which, in a nod to her life, she plays a children's librarian -- she was cast "the old-fashioned way: I auditioned, and lo and behold, they offered me a role. It was really quite straightforward."
"I definitely would like to keep doing that, and hopefully some interesting roles will come my way," Harper said. "I'm so excited to be on a roll. I'm having a really wonderful time."

Full text: Pedro Almodóvar's moving drama stars Julianne Moore and Tilda Swinton as friends facing mortality together.
At the end of James Joyce's 1914 story "The Dead," the main character is watching the snow fall on Dublin, late in the dark after a Twelfth Night dinner party. He's just learned something profoundly affecting about his wife's past, something he didn't know until now, and it's made him ruminative. Some day, every person he knows -- even him -- will be nothing more than memory. This thought is mortal, but not morbid. He finds it moving. "His soul swooned slowly," Joyce writes, "as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead."
Pedro Almodóvar borrows a version of that ending for his first English-language feature, "The Room Next Door," which he wrote and directed. Two characters lounge on chairs on a deck, watching as seemingly unseasonable snowflakes fall from the sky on them. They've been touched by mortality, and the process has proved strangely life-affirming. One repeats the last line from "The Dead."
This is not, it turns out, the ending of Sigrid Nunez's 2020 novel "What Are You Going Through," from which "The Room Next Door" is adapted. Almodóvar's film is more of an improvisation on the novel, borrowing some characters and plot points while telling a story all its own. (Joyce is indeed quoted in the novel, but the quote is from "Ulysses.") Both are about a pair of old friends who reunite while one is undergoing treatment for terminal cancer. Eventually, the sick friend asks the other to accompany her upstate, where she plans to take a euthanasia pill. In the novel, which meanders and winds around many a bend, the narrator is often asked, or asking, what she is going through. It's a riff on the philosopher Simone Weil: "The love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply means being able to say to him, 'What are you going through?"'

"The Room Next Door" takes a more straightforward path through its version, but though it goes unspoken, that question always lurks. Returned to New York after years living abroad, Ingrid (Julianne Moore) learns at a signing for her new book that her old friend Martha (Tilda Swinton), a war correspondent, is in the hospital, undergoing cancer treatment. She visits her, and they begin to grow close. The two women both dated the same man -- Damian (John Turturro), who once was full of joie de vivre but now makes a living delivering lectures about how the world is on the brink of environmental catastrophe. But their friendship stems from a shared youth working in journalism and spending their nights partying in New York.
Now, in middle age, things look a little different. Though everything looks different when death has come over the horizon. After some time, Martha asks Ingrid to come to the home she's rented in the woods, to be in "the room next door" when she decides it's time to go. Ingrid is frightened, and reluctant, but realizes it's what she must do. They close up Martha's apartment, pack suitcases and head upstate to face the end.
"The Room Next Door" is remarkably straightforward for an Almodóvar film, without the signature theatrics or sexual pyrotechnics that tend to pop up in the Spanish auteur's work. Every conversation is blunt, each character plain-spoken and uninterested in subtext. It takes a second to get used to -- movies are full of people saying the opposite of what they mean -- but it also feels refreshing, and true to these women in particular. They are past the point in life where it's expedient to dissemble, or to pretend to be something they're not.
Instead, they discuss everything: Martha's estranged daughter, or Ingrid's next book, or the things they have seen and learned in life. This is a richly textured film, set in beautiful buildings and gardens. Ingrid and Martha wear gorgeously hued clothes (and lipstick) and surround themselves with books and carefully selected things. They are sophisticated, educated people who have made lives for themselves according to their tastes and preferences.
Often movies ask what makes life worth living; this one asks what makes life worth leaving. It is a controversial subject, both in the movie and in the real world, and the film doesn't treat it lightly.
So the hovering specter of death is everywhere, but Martha doesn't mind. For her it gives the prospect of rest, of departing the world on her own terms. Ingrid is not there because she wants Martha to die, but because she wants to show her love -- to understand what she is going through, to go through it herself. It's balanced out with Damian's doomerism, which Ingrid can't quite quibble with but also finds appalling. He used to be full of joy, but his version of recognizing mortality has led him down quite a different path from Martha's.
Swinton and Moore are alone in conversation for much of the movie, two remarkably well-paired actors. Their easy youthful camaraderie returns almost immediately, and they address each other with love but also a simple self-respect. It is the sort of friendship you hope for in adulthood: honest, equal and willing to support the other even when their choice is different from the one you'd make.
Almodóvar's films often explore doubles: mothers and daughters, pairs of lovers, twisted friends. "The Room Next Door" does the same, in several different registers, and I think that's the point of the title. We cannot really know what another person is going through. Even if we follow Weil's exhortation and ask, we're incapable of fully inhabiting another person. We can't live inside of them. The real act of friendship, of love, is to check on one another in the morning and make sure we're still there. What we owe our neighbor is to set up camp, in whatever way we can, in the room next door to them.

Honda and Nissan Weigh Possible Merger: [Correction]

Full text: The merger talks between Japan's second- and third-largest automakers highlight the intense upheaval within the world's auto industry.
Honda Motor and Nissan Motor, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, are discussing ways to deepen their ties, including the possibility of a merger that could fundamentally restructure Japan's car industry.
The merger talks between the two storied Japanese giants highlight the intense upheaval within the world's auto industry, as carmakers grapple with expensive technological shifts, political instability and the rise of fast-growing Chinese rivals.
Though discussions are still at an early stage, the thinking at Nissan and Honda is that combining forces could provide the companies with the resources and scale necessary to navigate those immense pressures.
Last year, Honda sold 3.98 million vehicles and Nissan 3.37 million. Their combination could make them the world's third-largest automaker group, behind their Japanese rival Toyota Group, which sold 11.23 million vehicles last year, and Volkswagen Group of Germany, which sold 9.23 million.
Honda and Nissan began collaborating this year on the development of electric vehicles. Over several months, their discussions have expanded to include the potential creation of a new company under which both automakers would operate, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Nissan and Honda are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding within the next week to formally begin discussions of partnership-broadening steps, including the details of a potential merger, the people familiar with the matter said. No final decisions have been made, they said.
The companies said in statements that they were in talks. "As announced in March of this year, Honda and Nissan are exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other's strengths," they said. "We will inform our stakeholders of any updates at an appropriate time."
The possibility of merging forces would have been largely unthinkable for two Japanese titans of auto making just a decade ago. The talks underscore the level of churn in the industry as manufacturers move away from the internal combustion engine, which has powered the vehicles they have produced for most of the past century.
Honda and Nissan each need to invest billions of dollars in electric vehicles, said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market research firm.
"Moving forward in E.V.s is expensive, and some of the smaller players have to figure out how to pay for it," she said. "And it's harder than ever now, because sales of E.V.s are growing more slowly than people had expected just a few years ago."
Nissan shares soared more than 20 percent during trading in Tokyo on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news about a potential merger. Honda's shares fell slightly.
Honda, founded in 1948, has long pursued a go-it-alone approach, developing components like engines on its own and spurning globe-spanning alliances. But more recently, the amount of investment required for a shift toward battery-powered vehicles has led it to seek partnerships with companies including Sony in Japan and General Motors in the United States.
Established in 1933, Nissan in particular has struggled in recent years to keep up with the swiftly growing appetite for hybrid gas-electric vehicles in the United States and fully electric cars in China. Last month, Nissan unveiled deep cuts to its global operations and said it needed to take steps to speed up its development of new offerings in its core markets.
Nissan's global sales declined across its core markets -- North America, China and Japan -- in the first half of its fiscal year. During the April-to-September period, its operating profit fell 90 percent, to $ 214 million.
Japanese automakers, like their peers in the United States and Europe, are also facing intense competition from new, highly cost-competitive and technologically advanced rivals in China. After enjoying years of state support, Chinese makers of electric vehicles like BYD are pushing deeper into Europe and Southeast Asia, where Japanese manufacturers have long dominated.
Last year, China overtook Japan for the first time to become the world's largest car exporter. China's exports were boosted by strong demand for electric vehicles and its shipments to Russia, a market that Japanese and Western automakers withdrew from in response to the war in Ukraine.
Like the Western automakers G.M., Ford Motor and Volkswagen, Nissan and Honda have struggled to compete in China as local rivals offer low-cost models tailored to the domestic market, which is the world's largest. Nissan has forecast that its sales in China will fall 13 percent this fiscal year. Honda projected an even larger slump.
As the industry adapts to the new market dynamics, automakers worldwide are forging more alliances. In September, G.M. said it would work with Hyundai of South Korea on internal combustion, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Last month, Volkswagen said it would form a joint venture with the electric vehicle maker Rivian, a California start-up.
People at Honda and Nissan say a partnership could benefit both companies in a number of ways. Honda has a strong portfolio of fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles, and Nissan could help it build out its global supply chain for batteries. Nissan was an early pioneer in electric vehicles and has several popular models, including the Sakura minivehicle it offers in Japan.
Nissan also holds a large stake in Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller Japanese automaker. If a Nissan-Honda group is established, Mitsubishi will consider joining it, according to the Japanese newspaper Nikkei, which earlier reported the merger discussions.
Automotive mergers often fail to deliver the efficiencies and profits that executives hope for. DaimlerChrysler split after nine years of a mostly unhappy marriage. Stellantis was formed in the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, and the chief executive who helped engineer the pairing, Carlos Tavares, resigned under pressure this month.
Nissan and the French automaker Renault have been strategic partners for more than two decades, and both saw some benefits early on, but neither achieved the kind of growth and profitability levels that executives and analysts had expected.
Last year, Nissan and Renault agreed to take steps to unwind their alliance. Around the same time, Honda and G.M. decided to scrap a plan to develop a line of lower-priced electric vehicles, less than two years after the companies announced the joint effort.

Theater Debuts Ensure Streaming Hits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Just a few years ago, media executives thought theatrical releases didn't benefit their streaming services. Now, many of them think the opposite.
Amazon Studios spent $ 250 million to make "Red One," a comedic holiday action film starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans. Then the company pushed the film into more than 4,000 theaters, spending tens of millions more to market it.
So when the movie racked up only about $ 80 million in domestic box office receipts in recent weeks -- half of which goes to the theater operators -- it looked like a huge investment gone horribly bad.
Not so fast, Amazon says. "We did this for a very specific reason," Courtenay Valenti, the company's head of film, said.
And that reason: to make it a streaming hit.
For much of the past decade, Hollywood executives striving to catch Netflix started believing that the only way to increase the subscriber numbers for their own streaming services was either by significantly narrowing the time between a film's theatrical release and its appearance on streaming or by putting both out simultaneously. Disney did it with "Black Widow," much to the dismay of Scarlett Johansson. Warner Bros. did it with "Dune." This was the future.
On top of that, the thinking went, streaming would give movie studios a chance to spend far less on the expensive marketing required for a theatrical release. The algorithm would do all the work instead.
But the industry has now largely come to a very different conclusion: The key to making a movie a streaming success and attracting new subscribers is to first release it in theaters. It turns out that all the things that make theatrical movies successful -- expansive marketing and public relations campaigns, and valuable word of mouth -- continue to help movies perform once they land in the home.
"We really believe that this theatrical marketing campaign and a theatrical window for this movie will only further amplify and enhance what we always believed was going to be a strong performance on the service," Ms. Valenti said.
When "Red One" debuted on Prime Video last week, it became the No. 1 movie on the service, generating 50 million worldwide viewers in its first four days, the company said. It was Amazon MGM Studios' most-watched streaming film debut ever, even though "Red One" is still playing on over 3,000 screens in North America -- making it the latest theatrical release to find a big audience online.
Since August 2022, 65 percent of Netflix's weekly top 10 English-language films were movies it had licensed from studios after they debuted in theaters. And when Nielsen, the audience measurement company, crunched its data for the past two years, only three of its top 20 streaming movies of 2023 had been released straight to a streaming service. (The outliers were Disney's "Turning Red," which was first released to its service in 2022; Netflix's apocalyptic drama "Leave the World Behind," starring Julia Roberts; and the Jonah Hill and Eddie Murphy comedy "You People.")
In 2024, only four films in the top 20 went straight to streaming. Two of them, Netflix's "Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F" and Amazon's remake of "Road House," were based on previous theatrical titles. (The two streaming originals that made the list were Netflix's action film "Damsel," starring Millie Bobby Brown, and the heist film "Lift," with Kevin Hart.)
"You can objectively look at the data and see: Movies that have gone through the theatrical window perform better," said Casey Bloys, who has overseen HBO content since 2016 and has overseen the Max streaming service since 2020. "For us, I know it for a fact, and you can see it in data for other platforms. We're not the only one."
Mr. Bloys's sentiment is being echoed all over Hollywood.
"The better it does in theaters, the better it does on streaming," said Joe Earley, the head of Disney+ and Hulu.
During Disney's most recent earnings call, its chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said "a successful Disney movie today drives more value than it ever has in the past," affecting all his other business lines, including streaming, theme parks and consumer products.
It's not only new films that benefit from the copious marketing dollars spent on theatrical releases. (Summer blockbusters often cost north of $ 100 million in global marketing money, while even the smallest films have a hard time opening in theaters with marketing spends lower than $ 25 million.) When new chapters of a successful franchise are introduced to theaters, they prompt spikes in each company's catalog of films.
Paramount Plus said that when "A Quiet Place: Day One" premiered on its service, viewers increased their "engagement" with the other films in the "Quiet Place" franchise by 207 percent. For "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One," the percentage increase in interest in the other "Mission: Impossible" films was 181 percent.
"I think there's no doubt that theatrical films drive not only sign-ups to streaming services but obviously drive engagement, too," said Brian Robbins, the chief executive of Paramount Pictures. "They're a very, very, very powerful acquisition tool."
In many ways, the same hand-wringing that went into the latest declaration of the death of the multiplex is what fueled similar panic when new consumer technologies like televisions and DVD rentals were introduced. This time, things felt more pronounced, since the advent of streaming coincided with the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr. Robbins recalled that back in 2022, when he told an investor conference that theatrical movies would remain "the cornerstone" of Paramount's business, it was a radical position to take.
"At that time, everybody was freaking out about how streaming was going to cannibalize theatrical," he said.
It was a phenomenon, he said, that never happened.
Mr. Earley of Disney said the thought process just a few years ago was that if you started promoting a previous film in a franchise on a streaming service it would create consumer confusion over which film was in theaters.
"Back in 2020, we would not have merchandised 'Inside Out,' on Disney+," he said. "There was a thinking back then that if you do that, people will think that 'Inside Out 2' is also on Disney+, and they won't go to the theaters."
According to Nielsen, "Inside Out" is the sixth-most-watched streaming movie of 2024. "Inside Out 2" is the year's highest-grossing film.
Just a few years ago, Disney+ would never have promoted a theatrical movie on the service, either, for fear of frustrating the streaming consumer who would not have been able to watch that movie immediately at home. Now, the promotions are often prominent.
Mr. Earley uses the most recent "Planet of the Apes" movie as an example.
When "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes" entered theaters in May, the marketing team provided Hulu subscribers with an "exclusive look" at the film, an effort that gave them more reason to watch the eight other "Planet of the Apes" films available in the Hulu library and built excitement for the new film, even if they never made it to the theater to watch it.
Fans, Mr. Earley said, were "ravenous" when the film hit the streaming service.
Netflix is now the outlier in Hollywood, still avoiding wide theatrical releases for the movies it produces. The company continues to argue that putting a film in theaters detracts from viewership on streaming. It recently lost out on a $ 150 million bid to make "Wuthering Heights" for the service, with Margot Robbie and the writer-director Emerald Fennell opting for an offer that was some $ 50 million lower in exchange for the guarantee of a theatrical release. Yet, while few Netflix films have pierced the zeitgeist, the company -- with 283 million subscribers, far more than any other streaming service -- is doing something right.
Still, all studios are being more selective about what movies they are willing to put into theaters, because the cost to break through an ever-crowded marketplace of entertainment options is more expensive than ever.
"When we make a movie and release it in theaters, it has to have a level of undeniability that is going to make people leave the comfort of their homes," said Keith Le Goy, Sony's chairman of worldwide distribution.
In 2021, Mr. Le Goy made a deal with Netflix whereby every one of Sony's theatrical releases would head to the streaming giant after appearing in theaters. Thirty of the 32 Sony films landed in Netflix's top 10. Nineteen of them hit No. 1. Universal Pictures signed a similarly lucrative deal with the streamer that year for its animated films and renewed it last month to add an exclusive 10-month Netflix window for the company's live-action movies. In the past few years, Netflix's top films have been dominated by Universal animated titles like "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" and "Minions: The Rise of Gru."
Still, the theatrical movie business is very risky. For every "Wicked" that becomes a cultural phenomenon there is a "Joker: Folie à Deux," for which equal amounts of effort went into determining its success only to have audiences flat out reject it in theaters.
Yet, like the marketing campaign for "Red One," the one for "Joker" will not go to waste. A couple of weeks ago, Mr. Bloys said he expected the film, which grossed only $ 58 million at the domestic box office, to have a strong showing on Max.
He was right: Max released the movie on Friday, and it was service's No. 1 title over the weekend.
"Just because the box office didn't meet a certain threshold, I'm still happy to have it on the streaming service," he said.

How the Swedish Dungeons & Dragons Inspired Helldivers 2: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The studio behind the fastest-selling PlayStation title of all time adjusts its story arc based on corporate decisions by players.
As Arrowhead Studios was putting the finishing touches on its multiplayer sci-fi shooter Helldivers 2, Johan Pilestedt was firming up the game's online infrastructure.
Pilestedt, then the developer's chief executive and now its chief creative officer, estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000 people would buy Helldivers 2 at launch, based on audiences for similar games in the genre. He decided to make sure the studio's servers could handle up to 150,000 concurrent players, just in case.
But on Feb. 8, the day Helldivers 2 was released for the PlayStation 5 and the PC, Arrowhead's servers started crashing early.
A quarter of a million people had tried to log on and play the game, more than double Pilestedt's projections. The engineers got to work increasing what the servers could handle. Soon they had room for 400,000 players but blew through that almost immediately. They raised it to 500,000. Then 600,000.
Within days, Helldivers 2 had more than a million people playing at once, and by May, it had earned the distinction of the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, outpacing God of War Ragnarok with 12 million units sold in 12 weeks. The success was unexpected, even for those who made the game, a team-based shooter with similarities to Left 4 Dead and Destiny.
"I wouldn't have thought that people would care this much in a million years," Pilestedt said.
Although Helldivers 2, an intergalactic action-adventure with a setting and satirical tone reminiscent of Paul Verhoeven's cult classic "Starship Troopers," is technically a sequel, players were responding to what makes the game stand apart. Unlike other live service games, which typically introduce predetermined content on a seasonal basis, updates in Helldivers 2 form the backbone of a constantly evolving story that changes and fluctuates, sometimes drastically, depending on how players act.
"It felt cool and innovative," said Paul Tassi, a video game journalist at Forbes who frequently writes about live service games. "It's not structured like a traditional game."
Pilestedt pointed to an extraordinary moment in the summer when players were forced to make a stark moral decision typical of the game's mordant sense of humor: either take on a simple task to unlock a weapon, or abandon it to save a children's hospital from a siege by killer robots.
The developers, Pilestedt said, were pretty sure the players would go for the new weapon, a set of powerful anti-tank land mines capable of taking down larger enemies, which they had been wanting for months. But as the campaign waged on, it became clear that the community had decided to help the children. Once the hospital was saved, Arrowhead had to adjust its planned story to account for the choice.
"The sense of morality was actually weighing higher for them than getting new stuff, which was something that we really didn't foresee," Pilestedt said.
Helldivers 2's untraditional approach to the live service model was the plan from the start. As a child growing up in the 1980s, Pilestedt spent a lot of time playing Drakar och Demoner, Sweden's take on the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons.
Arrowhead, Pilestedt said, hoped to channel the idea of "going to someone's house to take part in an adventure that somebody has crafted for the rest of the group." When it was time to approach the game's live service component, the designers "started to think about that sort of crafted narrative, where gamers can influence the narrative with their actions, and there's a game master having to react to tell the next part of the story."
Helldivers 2 was written like a Dungeons and Dragons campaign: The studio sketched out a long-form choose-your-own adventure story, which it adjusts as the community completes (or fails) orders from the government of Super Earth, a self-proclaimed global democracy that is a thinly veiled authoritarian state.
The goal is to "liberate" planets in outer space, which in practice means stealing their resources and wiping out their native populations. Players work together to complete missions and work toward shared objectives, which are assigned weekly and require large-scale cooperation to finish before their time limits elapse.
Helldivers 2 has not maintained its sky-high player counts. Through November, the game's concurrent online player count on Steam was fluctuating between 28,000 and 56,000. (Sony does not publicly release data about the number of concurrent players.)
"It's a pretty quick drop, more sharp than average," Tassi said. "That long-term trend is something that would worry me a bit given that we don't know what the game is adding in the future."
In recent months, Arrowhead has been focused on addressing some common criticisms by tweaking weapon strength and retooling some of the core mechanics. The game's first major expansion, Escalation of Freedom, made several tweaks to the game's difficulty and balance that were received negatively by players when it was released in August, leading the studio to issue an apology.
Pilestedt said he believed that Escalation of Freedom was "a consequence of our success," requiring more work than expected from a team already under considerable strain. "We fell short," he said. In September, the team released a patch that served as a kind of course correction, walking back some of the earlier changes and making certain weapons more powerful to make the game easier and more fun.
The game has continued to engage players with its creative missions: Recent orders have included demands to fend off attacks on an interplanetary space station that is under construction; to "liberate" a mining colony from an army of killer robots; and a satirical request to recruit slave labor for the cause of democracy from the refugees of war-torn planets. One of the game's two major enemy factions, the Terminator-like Automatons, recently stole Helldiver jump pack technology, meaning that some of the droid platoons can now fly -- an example of the ways that the game tries keep players on their toes.
Pilestedt sees Helldivers 2 as a game that will evolve as the story continues to unfold and new secrets are revealed. Last week, Arrowhead surprised players with the game's next expansion, called Omens of Tyranny, which introduces a third faction of enemies that use mind control to convert a planet's civilian population into armies of zombies.
The novel approach to live service, according to Pilestedt, will have seismic consequences. "We have some really exciting updates coming," he said, "and some rather big twists and turns for the core expectations of what the Helldivers universe even is."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It was supposed to be a sleepy year for the video game industry. Then came surprise hits like Balatro, Animal Well and Astro Bot.
Last year was particularly strong for the video game industry. Several major releases found critical and commercial success, including Baldur's Gate 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, while smaller indie puzzlers like Chants of Sennaar also delighted audiences.
This year, the environment has not been nearly as kind. The rising cost of game development has hurt the bottom line for many studios. Thousands lost their jobs as executives attempted to streamline operations. Despite those challenges, there were many new games filled with creative vision and thought-provoking stories.
Here, in alphabetical order, are some of the best releases of 2024.
Animal Well
A single play-through of Animal Well is enjoyable enough. The game presents itself as a pixelated throwback to Metroidvania puzzlers, where players traverse a complicated labyrinth of rooms in search of power-ups that will open new paths and secrets. But in Animal Well there are secrets beyond those secrets. Players needed to convene in online forums and YouTube comment sections to figure them all out.
That kind of social experiment made a splash when Animal Well was first released, but even a later play-through can rekindle the joy of a game that is constantly -- and at just the right moments -- revealing that it has more tricks up its sleeves. (PC, PlayStation 5, Switch, Xbox Series X|S)
Astro Bot
Sony executives have never committed to a single mascot for their PlayStation brand. They flirted with characters like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon through the early 2000s before adopting grittier personas in the 2010s like Kratos from the God of War series and Aloy from the Horizon franchise.
Astro Bot, the protagonist of several tech demos, barely registered until the 2020 release of Astro's Playroom, a free game packaged with PlayStation 5 consoles. It became so popular that developers at Team Asobi created a full platformer that gives the little blue robot planets to explore and coins to collect in a celebration of Sony's history. The result is a quirky and lighthearted adventure that feels like a spiritual successor to Nintendo's Super Mario Galaxy games. (PS5)
Balatro
Nobody could have expected in the year 2024 that one of the most addicting games in recent memory would be a card game that turns poker on its head. But Balatro has sold more than two million copies with joker cards that allow players to bend the game's rules in their favor. Their random distribution makes for addicting play-throughs.
A recent port of the game to Android and iOS devices means you may be seeing commuters playing Balatro for years to come. It's a testament to the anonymous developer behind the project, LocalThunk, who was inspired by playing the Cantonese card game big two with co-workers. (Android, iOS, PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree
Had players experienced a collective delusion in 2022 when Elden Ring was released to rave reviews despite its sadistic difficulty and arcane rules? Not at all. A return to the Lands Between in the expansion Shadow of the Erdtree proved that the formula refined by Hidetaka Miyazaki remained a powerful draw. Vertical level design and seemingly impossible boss fights reminded players that victory feels even sweeter after being crushed by an enemy ten -- or a hundred -- times. (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth
Nostalgia is a powerful drug -- and a moneymaker, if the many remakes and sequels coming from the entertainment industry are any indication. But there is something special about Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth that remains with you, even months after playing it.
Some players say it is overstuffed with optional side quests; others are unhappy about an ending that seems needlessly designed to keep the death of a main character ambiguous. But these complaints feel minor for a game with sweeping narrative moments about a beautiful world headed toward environmental collapse. It helps that the gameplay remains one of the best compromises between classic turn-based strategy games and modern button-mashing action games. (PS5)
Helldivers 2
More than 12 million players have battled against hordes of alien bugs and robot soldiers across the galaxy of Helldivers 2. A smart design has gamers from around the world cooperating in missions that often scale to the limit of a user's ability, leading to breathless battles and shootouts with acid-spitting insects and terminator machines. Although Helldivers 2 takes inspiration from past sci-fi creations, including "Starship Troopers," it refines the gameplay loop into a chaotic battlefield of crossfire and ambushes. (PC, PS5)
Metaphor: ReFantazio
With enemies lifted from Hieronymus Bosch paintings and a narrative that takes a Dickensian twist on political powerlessness, Metaphor: ReFantazio constantly surprises. The world feels alive in the magical Kingdom of Euchronia, where your protagonist attempts to find a cure for a dying prince. But reality bleeds into this fantasy world as you live each day, completing basic tasks and forming bonds with other characters in a system inspired by another Atlus franchise, Persona.
During a period when many Hollywood films seem politically gutless, it's surprising to find a game that deals frankly with issues like racism and caste, asking players to think about their image of a utopian society. It helps that the gameplay is incredibly smooth and that its turn-based combat has strategic depth. (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S)
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown
One of the most overlooked games of the year, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is a superb addition to the long-running series, which has struggled to regain its footing since the 2000s. The main character, Sargon, explores a labyrinthine sacred city where time seems to have no meaning -- or at least a different meaning for his companions.
This is a special game with fluid action and difficult puzzles that make you feel like a genius for solving. It's a shame that it might be the only game like it in the series -- after poor sales, the game's publisher, Ubisoft, announced that it had rejected a planned sequel and disbanded the development team. (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
Silent Hill 2
When the original Silent Hill 2 released in 2001, it was immediately recognized for a psychologically thrilling story that had more to say about humanity than many of the zombie-slasher games from that period. It starred a flawed protagonist named James Sunderland, a widower lost in a foggy town whose rooms seem to bend around his memories.
This year's remake is a meticulous refinement of what made the original so impressive. The attention to detail can be seen in how the voice actors deliver their lines and how Sunderland's attitude and physicality shifts as he discovers dark truths about himself. (PC, PS5)
Still Wakes the Deep
This poor electrician named Caz is stranded on a perilous ocean oil rig that is collapsing off the Scottish coast. Through his eyes, the player experiences a horror of underwater creatures and gore, armed with little more than a flashlight and sometimes a hammer.
But it's a small design decision that really gets under your skin. Designers at the Chinese Room pulled the camera back just far enough in this first-person game to see Caz's flailing arms. You watch them shake with fright and shiver with cold. It makes him feel all the more human as he attempts to escape the burning rig. (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S)

Brazil's Oscar Contender Strikes a Nerve: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fernanda Torres still remembers the day her mother, Brazil's grande dame of film, came within reach of cinema's most coveted prize: an Oscar.
"It had great symbolism for Brazil," Ms. Torres, an acclaimed actress herself, said in an interview. "I mean, Brazil produced something like her, you know?" she added. "It was very beautiful."
A quarter-century ago, Fernanda Montenegro, now 95, made history when she became the first Brazilian actress to be nominated for an Academy Award. She lost to Gwyneth Paltrow, and Brazil never got over what it considered a snub.
Now, Ms. Torres, 59, is attracting chatter in Hollywood that could put her in line to win the elusive golden statuette for a role that has ignited cinematic fever -- and a national reckoning -- in Latin America's largest country.
Millions of viewers are packing theaters to watch "I'm Still Here," a quiet drama starring Ms. Torres about a family torn apart by a military junta that ruled Brazil, by fear and force, for over two decades.
This past week, the movie was nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign language film, and Ms. Torres was nominated in the lead actress category, bolstering Oscar hopes.
Though the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which oversees the Oscars, will not reveal its nominations until January, "I'm Still Here" is Brazil's official entry in the international feature film category.
At home, the movie has struck a nerve in a nation that suffered through the brutal dictatorship from 1964 to 1985.
Set in Rio de Janeiro in the 1970s, "I'm Still Here" tells the story of Eunice Paiva and her five children, whose lives are upended when the family patriarch, Rubens Paiva, a former congressman played by Selton Mello, disappears at the hands of the military government.
By telling this family's story, the film tackles a "piece of Brazilian history" that is being forgotten, said Walter Salles, the movie's director and one of the nation's most prolific filmmakers. "The personal story of the Paiva family is the collective story of a country."
The film has quickly become a national treasure, breaking box office records and eclipsing usual crowd-pleasers like "Wicked" and "Gladiator 2."
Since the release of "I'm Still Here" in early November, more than 2.5 million Brazilians have seen it in theaters, and it has grossed more than six times the amount made by last year's most-watched Brazilian film.
In a troubling twist, the movie was being widely shown in Brazil just as the police revealed new details about a plot to stage a coup and keep the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, a defender of the military dictatorship, in power after he lost the 2022 election.
Against this backdrop, the film's themes have gained an urgent new meaning, said Marcelo Rubens Paiva, whose book about his family inspired the movie.
"The timing was, unfortunately, perfect," he said, "because it showed this story isn't just in our past."
Human rights groups estimate that hundreds of people were disappeared and some 20,000 were tortured during the dictatorship. But, unlike Chile or Argentina, where many crimes committed there under military dictatorships have been tried and punished, Brazil has not pursued accountability for its military's atrocities.
In recent years, what many had seen as the distant past began to creep into the present. Mr. Bolsonaro, a retired army captain, spoke frequently in nostalgic terms about the dictatorship, awarded thousands of government jobs to soldiers and dismantled a panel investigating crimes committed during the military's rule.
Movies and other forms of cultural works were frequent targets of censorship during the dictatorship, which considered them political foes. Now, films like "I'm Still Here" can serve as "instruments against forgetting," Mr. Salles said. "Cinema reconstructs memory."
And the film has surely ignited Brazil's collective memory. In classrooms and newspaper pages, heated debates are unfolding over the legacy of the dictatorship. On social media, stories of suffering at the hands of the military government have gone viral, drawing millions of views.
On a recent rainy weekday, as moviegoers packed a Rio de Janeiro theater, it was clear that "I'm Still Here" had cast a wide spell. Groups of teenagers, fathers and sons and older couples were all clutching tickets.
Some snapped selfies in front of the movie's poster. Others took deep breaths before stepping into the theater's darkness.
Inside, the crowd gasped at the sounds of the torture of political prisoners; teared up when Eunice, played by Ms. Torres, defiantly smiled for a newspaper photo, unwavering in the face of tragedy; and stifled sobs when Ms. Montenegro made a silent appearance in the closing scenes, as an older Eunice whose memories were fading.
The film echoed a familiar past for many. "It shows everything we lived through," said Dr. Eneida Glória Mendes, 73, who grew up in a military family during the dictatorship.
Dr. Mendes, who has watched the film twice, remembers ripping up letters she received from friends who criticized the regime so that her father would not see them. Anyone sending or receiving such correspondence could have been detained.
"We were not free," she said. "Even a silly criticism could lead to arrest."
For younger Brazilians, the film offered a glimpse into a reality they had heard about only at school. "For my generation, there's this thirst to know more," said Sara Chaves, 25, an aspiring actress.
"I'm Still Here" has also captivated audiences and critics abroad. When it premiered in Venice this year, it won an award for best screenplay and drew a thundering applause that lasted 10 minutes.
So when the academy shared an image on social media of Ms. Torres at a Hollywood industry gala last month, Brazilians went wild. "Give her the award already!" said one of the more than 820,000 comments on Instagram.
If she is nominated in the best actress category, Ms. Torres would be following a remarkably similar path to her mother, who was nominated in 1999 for her role as a letter writer for illiterate people in "Central Station," a Brazilian classic also directed by Mr. Salles.
"There was this feeling in the country that she was deeply wronged," said Isabela Boscov, a Brazilian cinema critic who has been reviewing films for three decades.
"I'm Still Here" is widely expected to receive a nomination in the international film category, according to Hollywood insiders, but Ms. Torres's chances are more uncertain.
Sony Pictures Classics, the studio distributing "I'm Still Here" globally, which launched the successful best actress nomination bid for Ms. Montenegro, is making a concerted push for Ms. Torres. Yet she may face tough odds this year in a crowded field that includes names like Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman.
To Ms. Torres, an Oscar nomination "would be a big victory" in itself, but she is not getting her hopes up. "It would be an incredible story if I got there, following my mother," she said. "Now, winning -- I consider it impossible."
Since the first Oscars ceremony in 1929, only two actresses have won awards for leading roles in foreign-language films.
On a recent Sunday afternoon at Ms. Torres's home, she sat across from her mother, reminiscing about art and family and other films the two have made together.
"This is also a legacy of life, of a profession," Ms. Montenegro said, gesturing toward her daughter, then herself.
After a career spanning more than seven decades, Ms. Montenegro is still acting in films and onstage. But her movements are slower, her eyesight is weakening and she rests more.
Sharing a character with her daughter, in a film that has inspired awe and soul-searching across Brazil, has carried personal symbolism, too. "It's a really special moment," Ms. Montenegro said.
After a final lipstick check in the mirror, the two actresses faced a camera for a photograph for this article. They moved their faces close together, their cheeks nearly touching. Like Eunice Paiva, in the movie both are in, they prefer to smile.
"My mother is still alive; all is well with her," Ms. Torres explained. "I'm happy."
"By chance, I'm still here," Ms. Montenegro replied. Ms. Torres chimed in: "We're still here."

Unveiling the Eerie Score Behind the Leather Mask: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Fifty-one years after the smash horror movie, its groundbreaking and unconventional music -- long a "holy grail" -- will arrive on vinyl.
In 1996, years before helping to found the experimental rock institution Animal Collective, David Portner and Brian Weitz were Baltimore high school pals who diligently hunted for the soundtrack album that perfectly meshed their love of the unorthodox sound worlds of musique concrète and the thrills of horror movies: "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre." "It wasn't really till years later that I found out that it had never been released," Portner said.
"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" changed the horror business when it splattered out in 1974, turning a spartan budget into a $ 30 million juggernaut and laying groundwork for the blood-soaked slasher genre that dominated the 1980s. Among its many innovations was its unconventional score, an abstract suite of bone-chilling scrapes, metallic clanks, ominous drones and mysterious stingers.
This symphony of discordance, recorded by the film's director Tobe Hooper and the sound man Wayne Bell, emerged three full years before the first commercially available industrial music from Throbbing Gristle. It anticipated the tape-traded noise music underground that flourished in places like Japan in the 1990s and the American Midwest in the '00s. But with the master tapes ostensibly lost and Hooper seemingly uninterested in an official release, the "Chain Saw" score survived mostly as a bootleg, often just the entire 83-minute film dubbed to audio cassette from a VHS or Laserdisc.
That half-century of tape hiss and YouTube rips will end in March with a vinyl release on the boutique soundtrack label Waxwork Records. (Pre-orders start this week.)
"It was kind of like a holy grail. Was it even possible to do it?" said the Waxwork co-founder Kevin Bergeron, who had been doggedly pursuing the release for more than a decade. "Everyone has asked. Literally every label from Sony to Waxwork. Major labels to independents to randos living with their parents. Everyone wanted to release it. What would it take to make it happen? No one had any sort of intel, like what would it cost or what would it take."
Bell had held on to a few of the original tapes, but a majority were assumed lost. After the success of "Chain Saw," Hooper left Austin for Hollywood, leaving behind a storage shed full of personal effects. But the "Chain Saw" tapes were not absorbing water damage or rotting away in some hot Texas garage: They would be quietly donated to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, lovingly archived alongside Albert Einstein's notes, a Frida Kahlo self-portrait and a Gutenberg Bible.
"Suddenly they're artifacts," Bell said in a recent video interview. "Sometimes you need to wear gloves to handle this stuff. So the idea of threading it up on a machine and listening to exactly know what you've got? I just had to go by what little notes I had in 1974 and, by eye, just recognizing my handwriting and remembering what tapes we had." He finally got to hear the digitized version of their audio this year.
With $ 16 in his bank account, Bergeron first reached out to Bell in 2013, before Waxwork even stamped its first LP. After years playing guitar in horror-centric punk and thrash bands, Bergeron started Waxwork with his girlfriend, Sue Ellen Soto, with the idea of becoming the "Criterion Collection of soundtracks" by releasing albums with newly commissioned artwork, liner notes from the filmmakers and whimsically colored vinyl. Bergeron sent almost-monthly correspondence to Bell for a decade. All emails to Hooper, up to his death in 2017, went unanswered.
"A big pitch of mine was, 'Look, there's a lot of parallels between how we conduct business and how you guys conduct business,"' said Bergeron, who sees a corollary between Waxwork's D.I.Y. ethic and the spirit of idealistic hippies in the desert cobbling together a horror movie. "I would hate to see this precious thing that they've guarded for 50 years get in the hands of a major or someone that's going to do some Hollywood accounting and rip people off."
Getting the requisite tapes and permissions was an odyssey, but making a coherent album from them would prove a different challenge entirely. As an editor, Bell, 73, is now a seasoned veteran with credits on more than a dozen Richard Linklater movies. He said the estimated 10 to 12 hours of sound on the "Chain Saw" tapes was of good fidelity and would allow the listener to "really hear into this music." However, nothing was mixed down. This meant a three-month process of reconstructing the familiar cacophony from the original raw materials, hand-scrawled notes and 50-year-old memories.
"It's putting together a thousand-piece puzzle of very similar-shaped and similar-looking pieces," he explained.
The tapes contained the sounds as they were originally recorded in the 1970s: Bell and Hooper experimenting and laughing on the carpeted floor of a spare bedroom belonging to the director's then-girlfriend, Paulette Gochnour. The body of an upright bass was used as a reverb chamber and its metal bridge served as a mount for a mobile made of can lids. Cymbals were scraped against the strings of a lap steel guitar. Lithography plates were flapped around like dish towels. Children's percussion instruments were chimed and rattled. When Bell heard Gochnour cooking with an 11-inch sauce pan, its bell-like tone inspired him to fill it halfway with water and strike it with a timpani mallet.
"Just because the sound comes from a stringed instrument, you could torture it such that you don't know that that's a string instrument or it doesn't necessarily sound musical," said Bell, who had already honed these techniques in playful jam sessions with Hooper. "Clearly these sounds had emotional properties, they made you think this or that, would trigger the mind. So it was a fertility that was right there already for us."
After these sounds were pieced together and matched with the grainy footage of Leatherface's murder spree, they took on a life that extended far beyond the borders of Texas. In '80s London, where "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" was banned outright, the Iphar label sold cassette bootlegs of the score alongside first-generation extreme noise artists like Ramleh, S.P.K. and Consumer Electronics. Alternative metal bands in the '90s including Nine Inch Nails, White Zombie and Marilyn Manson peppered their albums with "Chain Saw" dialogue and sounds. The fleet-fingered oddball guitarist Buckethead professed that he would solo over the drone feast that follows the actor William Vail getting bludgeoned to death with a hammer. The director Nicolas Winding Refn pushed the composer Cliff Martinez to put more "Chain Saw" influence in the game-changing synth soundtrack to "Drive" from 2011.
Aaron Dilloway, a solo artist and onetime member of the noise band Wolf Eyes, called the "Chain Saw" score "ground zero for noise music." He recorded the entire film to audio cassette and would play it in the van on Wolf Eyes tours, and once accompanied the rest of the band using "Chain Saw" audio played on a variable speed cassette player. (He accidentally concluded the set with an incredibly spooky recording of the actor Paul A. Partain's disembodied voice calling out for Jerry the van driver.)
"Nothing sounds like that. Nothing," Dilloway said of Hooper and Bell's score. "I mean, there's little bits and stuff here and there, but nothing's been able to get that screech like that -- eeeeeerrrgh. There's nothing else like it. And it's always just been stuck in my head. You want to strive for that. Make something as scary and as unique as that sound."
Portner, who records as Avey Tare, spent Animal Collective's earliest days in New York without a practice space or much room to hold instruments. "It was a way of seeing that you could make music with anything," he said of the score. "You could have as much of a dramatic effect or emotional effect just banging on pots and pans if that's all that was around."
With the official Waxwork release -- complete with two never-heard-before cues -- the "Chain Saw" score's legacy is secure, though its story may not be finished. Bell estimated that he had 95 percent of the material, but said there was still a single missing tape he would like to incorporate to complete the picture.
"There's a cue that I knew I didn't have," he explained, "and I didn't want to do an ersatz version of that. 'Cause it's very important that it be what 'Chain Saw' fans expect. I've felt a big responsibility to deliver this. A responsibility to myself and to Tobe and to the film, but also to the fans."
Starting in 2022, he even started appearing at horror conventions. He found the gaggle of cosplaying "Chain Saw" fans to be interesting and likable.
Said Bell with a laugh, "I've never been around so many Leatherfaces in my life."

Suffused With the Law of Tooth and Claw. And Silliness.: [Review]

Full text: Aaron Taylor-Johnson's buff Marvel hero is overshadowed by unabashedly fun villains.
Built on brawn, J.C. Chandor's action sci-fi picture "Kraven the Hunter" is limited by incomprehensible plotting and dodgy one-liners delivered by a cast who seem to be practicing their worst Russian accents. If not for the bevy of anticlimactic fights, "Kraven the Hunter" could be so bad it's good. Instead, it's merely another excursion away from the Marvel Cinematic Universe to Sony's series of defanged comic book villains.
Kraven's baffling origin story finds a jumbled through-line in half brothers Sergei and Dmitri's tight-knit relationship. Sons of Russian drug dealer Nikolai Kravinoff (Russell Crowe, adopting a low, growling accent), the boys are persistently pushed by their bloodthirsty father to be stronger than Sergei's mother, who recently died by suicide. To harden them, Nikolai takes them hunting in Ghana. "Shoot to kill. Fun," Nikolai grumbles. Fun for Sergei is short-lived when a lion mauls him. Only a potion provided by a passerby named Calypso saves Sergei, imbuing him with otherworldly vision, agility and strength.
Fast forward 16 years and a hulking Sergei (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is now a vigilante known as "Kraven the Hunter," who's pursuing criminals that remind him of his estranged father. Aleksei Sytsevich (Alessandro Nivola), a Russian mercenary who can morph into a rhino, is not only worried that Kraven will soon pursue him. Aleksei also wants to eliminate his rival Nikolai. Aleksei kidnaps Dmitri and dispatches a time-morphing assassin called the Foreigner (Christopher Abbott) to pursue Kraven. With an adult Calypso (Ariana DeBose) providing aid, Kraven tries to free Dmitri.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Thankfully, "Kraven the Hunter" doesn't take itself too seriously. Like Sony's "The Venom" franchise and "Madame Web," the story is incidental to these larger-than-life characters. While Taylor-Johnson does his best Hugh Jackman impression -- posing for glamour shots of his ripped body before crawling and flying across the frame -- only a couple of actors here know exactly what movie they're in. Abbott is captivatingly slippery, rolling his slender frame and casting his bewitching eyes on his victims with cool intent. Nivola, on the other hand, is the type of ham you'd find in Joel Schumacher's Batman films. From his surprising hissing to his stocky build, every choice he makes is spontaneous yet wholly grounded in this troubled character.
If the action in "Kraven the Hunter" was as well conceived as its villains, it'd be a riot. Unfortunately, the brawls are physically detached from the environment. The choreography lacks punch and design; the compositions are spatially unaware. Kraven and Aleksei 's final tussle, an anticlimactic mud fight in the middle of a field, ends as quickly as it began. The film adds a pound of revenge and an ounce of a surprise to its final moments, but these ingredients, including the entertaining silliness, aren't enough for "Kraven the Hunter" to catch the biggest game -- our admiration.

Full text: Neil Druckmann said Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, the adventure of a galactic bounty hunter, would be a story about faith.
After becoming known for cinematic storytelling and heartbreaking realism through franchises such as The Last of Us and Uncharted, Neil Druckmann said his next video game would take place in the fantastical reaches of space, where a tattooed bounty hunter watches anime and drives a Porsche-branded rocket ship.
"The story is quite ambitious," centering on a fictitious religion and "what happens when you put your faith in different institutions," said Druckmann, studio head of Naughty Dog, a development company owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Druckmann has also written and directed episodes of HBO's "The Last of Us," which tells a story of grief and grudges in postapocalyptic America.
The new game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, was announced on Thursday in a cryptic trailer at the Game Awards that showed a few seconds of gameplay in which the protagonist battles a hulking cyborg with swordlike weapons. The story is set in an alternative universe where space travel has significantly advanced by 1986.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Druckmann declined to share many details about Intergalactic, which is the first original story he and his team have created in almost 15 years and does not have a release date. But he said it was a return to Naughty Dog's roots in the action-adventure genre that helped build the studio's reputation with franchises like Crash Bandicoot. It takes inspiration, he said, from classic anime like the 1988 movie "Akira" and the 1990s series "Cowboy Bebop."
Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who have composed film scores for "Challengers" and "The Social Network," wrote the soundtrack for Intergalactic. Tati Gabrielle ("Chilling Adventures of Sabrina") will star as the bounty hunter, Jordan Mun, and Kumail Nanjiani ("Silicon Valley") will play Colin Graves, one of her wanted men.
Gabrielle was a standout during the casting process, said Druckmann, who has worked with her several times. She was the villain in the "Uncharted" movie and will play Nora in the second season of "The Last of Us."
"She has this intimidating presence to her," he said. "We brought her in for an audition, and she blew us away. It was one of those moments -- like when I first saw Ashley Johnson as Ellie," one of the main characters from The Last of Us.
More than 250 Naughty Dog employees have worked on Intergalactic over the past four years, in addition to outside artists in Druckmann's network.
Druckmann, 46, said that the chance to make something new was earned after a string of successful games -- The Last of Us franchise has sold more than 37 million copies, Naughty Dog said early last year -- and that he did not feel like he had something to prove at this point in his career.
Developing new intellectual property can be nerve-racking because of the financial investment; Naughty Dog has had a series of layoffs over the past two years and underwent a restructuring that Druckmann said would ensure the company could operate as "an I.P. powerhouse."
"It is about striking a balance of business and art," he said. "It is not just jumping on any opportunity to increase our bottom line."
Druckmann said he was keenly aware that some gamers have eagerly awaited news about Intergalactic.
"It's really hard to work on these things in secret and silence for so many years," he said, "and then to see our fans go on social media and say, 'Enough with the remasters and remakes! Where are your new games and new I.P.s?"'
He added, "We are finally starting to lift the curtain on this thing."

Astro Bot Named Game of the Year: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The exploration of Sony history held off Balatro and Metaphor: ReFantazio, which each received several awards at an annual showcase for the industry.
The plucky platformer Astro Bot won the top prize at the Game Awards on Thursday, a crowning achievement for a character who originated as an asset for a PlayStation tech demo.
The game, developed by Team Asobi, is both a mascot platformer in the vein of Crash Bandicoot and an exploration of the deep catalog of Sony franchises. In his review for The New York Times, the critic Harold Goldberg called Astro Bot an "enjoyable endeavor that often showcases the brilliance of game makers who know their history."
Astro Bot also received awards for best game direction, best action/adventure game and best family game. It beat five other nominees for game of the year: Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Metaphor: ReFantazio.
The awards ceremony, now in its 10th year, recognizes artistic and technical achievements in the video game industry and showcases announcements of new games from high-profile developers.
Among the games announced on Thursday was Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, the next project by Neil Druckmann and Naughty Dog, the studio that created The Last of Us and Uncharted. The story, which Druckmann told The Times is inspired by classic anime, follows a bounty hunter in an alternative universe where space travel has significantly advanced by 1986.
Several of the other games revealed were cooperative adventures: Split Fiction, a split-screen exploration of friendship by the studio that made It Takes Two; Stage Fright, in which the creators of Overcooked incorporate escape room mechanics; and Elden Ring: Nightreign, a new approach for the ruthless action franchise by FromSoftware.
The celebrity guests this year included the gaming auteur Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear Solid, Death Stranding), the prolific voice actor Troy Baker and the actor Ella Purnell, who this year has starred in the television adaptation of the postapocalyptic Fallout as well as "Arcane," which is based on the multiplayer game League of Legends. (Harrison Ford showed up with Baker to promote Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.)
There were also performances by the rapper Snoop Dogg, who was recently added as a character in Fortnite, and the band Twenty One Pilots, which has a song on the "Arcane" soundtrack.
More than two dozen awards were handed out in categories including performance, narrative and art direction; votes from journalists accounted for 90 percent of the selection process, while public fan voting determined the rest. Notable wins were Helldivers 2 for best multiplayer game and Black Myth: Wukong for best action game.
Astro Bot held off five other games to win the top prize.
Balatro, a pixelated game made by a pseudonymous developer who goes by LocalThunk, was an unusual contender in a category typically filled with titles from giant studios. But people flocked to the game, which distorts the rules of poker and has players racking up points into the millions with hands buoyed by powerful abilities from themed joker cards. Balatro was named best mobile game, best independent game and best debut indie game.
The medieval fantasy Metaphor: ReFantazio, developed by Atlus, sets up a succession plot after a king is assassinated and different powers in a fictional kingdom vie for control, reflecting upon the role of utopian art in a society. Metaphor won awards for best role-playing game, best narrative and best art direction.
Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which received the award for best score and music, is the second of three installments that reinvents the classic 1997 role-playing title developed by the studio Square Enix for an age of luxe visuals and open-world exploration.
Black Myth: Wukong, considered China's first "AAA" title, a term for big-budget games with global audiences and sophisticated gameplay and graphics, was named best action game. An adaptation of the classic Chinese novel "Journey to the West," it broke records for the most concurrent users in a single-player game when it launched on Steam.
There was debate online about the final nominee, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, which is a large and vicious expansion instead of a stand-alone game. The original Elden Ring, by FromSoftware, won game of the year when it was released in 2022.
Here is a partial list of winners:

Musicians Join Players to Enliven a Video Game: [Correction]

Full text: A controller will direct a conductor's baton during live performances of Journey at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
For each music cue in the dreamlike, solemn odyssey of the video game Journey, the engine tracking the player's behavior pulls from a library of compositions, scoring a dynamic path through the game's vast desert landscapes.
At the Brooklyn Academy of Music this week, a live orchestra is taking on the same task in Journey LIVE. In both performances, at least five players will take turns using a controller to pilot a nameless robed figure through the online game, triggering music cues that the orchestra must perform in the moment as the player progresses through the story or takes unexpected detours.
"I always like to tell people it will be like the most challenging wedding you've ever played," said Melissa Ngan, a flutist who has played in Journey LIVE several times and now leads the orchestra playing the show at BAM. "Many of us remember those moments early in our lives where we played wedding after wedding, and you just have to have one eye on the ensemble and your music, and the other eye on what's happening down the aisle."
Journey is a wordless game, and Austin Wintory's Grammy-nominated score acts as a kind of narration as the robed figure follows traces of an ancestral civilization through the sun-dappled desert and into the bowels of structures that once teemed with life.
Though roughly linear, the game has no explicit missions. The narrative unfolds as the player explores different landscapes. The game's eight major sections are each broken into three scenes, and each of those contain up to seven musical jump points.
The score is an evolving soundscape, moving from mournful cello and oboe to sprightly pizzicato plucking of strings to a shimmering harp. That means the orchestra must prioritize continuity, a unique challenge in a field where concertos and symphonies are neatly divided into discrete movements.
"The musicians have to learn a way of thinking more than they have to learn the notes on the page," said Wintory, who is conducting Journey LIVE at BAM.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The musicians -- 21 players from the American Composers Orchestra and a solo cellist -- are prepared to switch to the score's jump points based on where a player decides to go in the game. (A soprano is also present to perform the vocal sections of the score's final track.) Wintory relays that information to the orchestra with hand signals as he watches the screen behind them.
To indicate the next segment, Wintory holds up a certain number of fingers; he confirms the transition for the next downbeat with a thumbs up. Some musicians use foot pedals to flip between the score's pages on an iPad while others read off analog sheet music that shows entire movements. A segment can last only seconds or several minutes.
Skipping around is common. While the orchestra rehearses all possible pieces of music that a player could prompt, Wintory said that maybe one in 10 players would explore in enough detail to require a snippet for a tower hidden to the side of the game world.
"The player takes on a curatorial role as well as the role of the conductor," said Dan Visconti, the former artistic director for Fifth House Ensemble who is now a producer for Journey LIVE. "It's exciting to see people from all walks of life be able to come up and effectively conduct an orchestra."
The show premiered in 2016 at MAGFest, an annual convention in Maryland dedicated to video games and their soundtracks. Earlier iterations were played by Fifth House, a former Chicago group co-founded by Ngan, who is now the president and chief executive of the American Composers Orchestra.
That it has arrived at BAM is a sign of the growing profile of video game music and the push for arts institutions to cultivate relationships with nontraditional audiences. "With Journey LIVE, we bring together two distinct audiences -- gaming aficionados and orchestral music fans," BAM's artistic director, Amy Cassello, said in a statement.
Video game music has been considered a novelty in orchestral spaces, and is even the punchline punishment for Cate Blanchett's disgraced conductor in the 2022 film "Tár." If that perception is changing, it is not an exaggeration to cite Journey as a reason.
Journey, which was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2012, is a frequent answer to the question of whether video games can be art. It was the first video game score to receive a Grammy nomination, for best score soundtrack for visual media. Wintory competed with luminaries like Hans Zimmer ("The Dark Knight Rises") and John Williams ("The Adventures of Tintin") in a category won by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."
The Journey LIVE experience is not an exact copy of what a player would hear in the game because Wintory makes decisions on what will work best in the moment. That could mean delaying a transition by a half-second or slowing down the tempo for a smoother handoff to a location-based music cue.
One of the highlights of Journey is the player's interaction with kind figures in white robes who guide them through terrain and hidden corners. They are actually other players somewhere else in the world choosing to help other players and they remain unidentified until the game's end credits, which include the screen names of everyone met along the way.
At Journey LIVE, where that reveal plays out in front of the audience, it means a graceful orchestral flourish can punctuate a shout-out to the contributions of "PeePants123."
That example is not theoretical. Ngan said someone in the audience at that performance was able to connect with PeePants123, a white robe who said, "I had no idea that I was on the stage in front of 500 people, and I haven't been able to change my screen name since I was 13."
Though the spontaneity of a live player, like the ones in the Journey LIVE performances, is an intriguing premise, Wintory said the idea was to center the player onstage and treat that person like a senior conductor or a concerto soloist, not as a novelty. "The goal is not to make it sort of a circus act," he said.
But the high-wire pressure remains: The players are given no instructions, and no part of the gameplay is choreographed. BAM identified its onstage players through an online submission form, seeking those deeply familiar with the game to drive the show forward.
Journey is rife with secrets, but the players are reminded that they are in front of a live audience that does not have all night to watch them stress test the orchestra's responsiveness. If players move somewhat promptly through the game, Journey LIVE runs for about 90 minutes.
"Don't try to platinum the game on this one," Wintory said, a joking reference to the digital trophy players get when they fully complete a PlayStation game.
Kellee Santiago, the co-founder and former president of the Journey developer thatgamecompany, has seen Journey LIVE twice and suggested a different approach.
"Pause for an oddly long amount of time at one place in the game," she said. "There's always something that you hear in the music in those moments that is delightful and surprising."

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's tough to imagine that this Illumination franchise will ever stop churning out movies. Children keep watching, so why not continue with Minion mania? This time around, Gru (Steve Carell), supervillain gone good (sort of), is in the witness protection program with his wife, Lucy (Kristen Wiig), and their kids, including his new baby son, Gru Jr.
The actual villain here is Maxime Le Mal (Will Ferrell), an old boarding school classmate of Gru's who is out for revenge because Gru once humiliated him. As payback, Maxime schemes to kidnap Gru Jr. and turn him into a cockroach. Maxime and his girlfriend, Valentina (Sofia Vergara), employ an army of roaches as their henchmen in this quest (they also want to conquer the world while they're at it).
My son, who has seen all of the films, didn't tire of the Minions humor or Gru's antics. There's a surprise bonus scene after the credits, so make sure your little ones stick around. The franchise director and producer Chris Renaud co-directed with Patrick Delage. Ken Daurio and Mike White wrote the script.
'Kung Fu Panda 4'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Jack Black returns as the voice of Po, the lovable martial arts master at the center of this DreamWorks franchise. Po would rather munch on cookies and dumplings than meditate or find inner peace, but that doesn't stop his mentor Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) from asking Po to succeed him as spiritual leader.
In past films, Po has fought and conquered fearsome villains, but none as powerful as The Chameleon (Viola Davis), a new baddie determined to steal Po's Staff of Wisdom and summon back all the evildoers Po defeated in the previous films. Po sets off for Juniper City to find and stop The Chameleon, with the help of a wisecracking, thieving fox named Zhen (Awkwafina). Po's biological dad, Li Shan (Bryan Cranston), and adoptive father, Mr. Ping (James Hong), follow along to protect him.
This installment is not as clever as the previous films, but it's still beautifully animated, funny and action-packed, and should appeal to older children who remember the original and viewers who are meeting Po for the first time. Mike Mitchell ("Trolls") directed (Stephanie Ma Stine gets a co-directing credit). Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger and Darren Lemke wrote the script.
'Felix and the Hidden Treasure'
Stream it on Hulu.

This animated adventure out of Canada follows Felix (voiced by Elias Harger in the English-language version) as he sneaks away from his seaside home on the Magdalen Islands of Quebec to try to find his father, a fisherman who was lost at sea two years earlier. On this mission, he and his dog, Rover, set sail with a white-bearded, wizened lighthouse keeper named Tom (Vlasta Vrana) to Darkshadow Island.
The villain here is Morgäa (Karine Vanasse), the leader of what she calls a "community" but which is, as most adults watching will realize, a New Age cult. Her power comes from a silvery spider who seems to have the ability to grant eternal youth and life, but when Felix, Tom and Rover arrive, her hold on her subjects (and on her eternal youth) is threatened. When Felix finds his father trapped on the island, he learns important lessons about wisdom and age. It's a lesson that might land with adults and not children, but the movie should appeal to youngsters who love adventure stories about hidden treasure and characters' battling the high seas. Nicola Lemay directed, and Arthur Holden wrote the English adaptation.
'The Garfield Movie'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Garfield character made his big debut in Jim Davis's comic strip in 1978, and the portly, lazy, lasagna-loving orange tabby cat quickly became a meme generator of sorts long before memes were a thing. There were "I Hate Mondays" coffee mugs and T-shirts that read, "I'm not overweight. I'm under tall." There have been specials, TV shows and movies. This year, Sony brought the tubby tabby back for a new generation of children, now with Chris Pratt voicing Garfield and Nicholas Hoult as Garfield's owner, Jon.
Garfield is living his best couch-potato life with Jon and his canine pal Odie (Harvey Guillén). He binges shows on Catflix (yes, really) and tries not to exert himself, but when he and Odie are kidnapped by thugs working for a vengeful cat named Jinx (Hannah Waddingham), Garfield has no choice but to go where the adventure takes him. And what started as a comic strip about a cat whose goal was to be as inert as possible becomes an action-packed heist film.
Yes, it's a little silly and not exactly true to Davis's original character, but children looking for a few laughs and a little fun should be entertained. Mark Dindal "(The Emperor's New Groove," "Chicken Little") directed, and Paul A. Kaplan, Mark Torgove and David Reynolds wrote the screenplay.
'Good Burger 2'
Stream it on Paramount+.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
With this sequel to the 1997 film about the goofball fast-food workers and best buddies Dexter (Kenan Thompson) and Ed (Kel Mitchell), 1990s Nickelodeon nostalgia is in full force. Decades later, Dex returns to Good Burger to get a job after his latest entrepreneurial venture fails. Ed now owns the restaurant, and he's been trying to fend off corporate bigwigs who are trying to take over his beloved little burger joint. Desperate for money, Dex ropes Ed into signing a contract without reading the fine print, and Good Burger is sold to Katt Bozwell (Jillian Bell), the head honcho at MegaCorp who wants to replace Good Burger's human work force with robot lookalikes.
There are food fights, pranks, pratfalls and throwback cameos from the original movie including from Carmen Electra and Lori Beth Denberg. Older children who like over-the-top antics and gross-out humor probably won't care about the timely A.I. plotline, but they'll be entertained by Thompson and Mitchell's shtick. Phil Traill directed, and the original "Good Burger" writers Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert teamed up again for the script.

Full text: Everyone's searching for something in Lego Horizon Adventures, where a science fiction franchise gets an entertaining brick makeover.
More often than not, the long-running children's series of Lego video games has focused on instantly recognizable characters: Batman, Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker.
The star of Sony's science fiction Horizon game franchise does not have such an expansive fan base. Yet the single-minded, redheaded Aloy is a wise choice for one of these lighthearted branded games, which exude so many happy, humorous vibes.
In this Lego world, Aloy's battle is against formerly peaceful animal-robots like the Sawtooth, a riff on pouncing saber-toothed tigers. They shoot swirling circles of fire. The Buried Shadow, the darkest, scariest creature in the Horizon series, is a cute but devilish balloon blob here, something well-suited for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. You can hide from most of the machines in patches of tall grass, which Aloy calls "so itchy."
Aloy also needs to discover her own origins, often via a holographic character named Elisabet. The eager warrior's base of operations is called Mother's Heart, inhabited by nature lovers who are hunter-gatherers. As you progress, the almost-unpopulated town grows as you build customizable structures, totems and environments. Fifteen hours in and you'll find it teeming with clucking chickens and plastic minifigures who fish, eat, converse, dance and generally enjoy life. Just look at their animated drawn-on faces.
The stripped-down plot eschews the game franchise's serious, sometimes perplexing epic tale that features Aloy as kind of a religious savior. Here, the objectives are simpler, clearer -- and unapologetically goofy.
Other heroes from Horizon Zero Dawn make appearances as playable protagonists in a postapocalyptic world where there's no "social media or cat videos." The reinvention of the clumsy Varl, an ardent warrior, includes a passion for comic book collecting. He puts on gloves before touching a rare graphic novel.
The crumbs in this game's trail are shiny Lego studs, which also can be used to buy outfits and upgrade Mother's Heart. Sometimes, you find treasure chests full of them.
In the store, you can also add items from Ninjago, another Lego-branded game, and modern buildings. This mash-up doesn't dovetail with the carefully created Horizon milieu where Sony's lush, lurid environments are so meticulously reinvented through Lego blocks and pieces. No one is yearning to see a bright white police station in a land where lumber is the primary building material.
Each robotic machine is introduced in a comical but terrorizing cut scene, its name boldly and brightly emblazoned onscreen. The level design is generally repetitive. Walk over arched bridges and attractive waterfalls. Stock up on studs. Open a vendor's treasure chest to discover a power-up, like fiery boots Aloy can wear to jump over an enemy and burn them. Fight a number of machines in a circular environment reminiscent of a corral. Receive a gold brick reward and begin the next chapter.
In previous Lego games, a single player could switch between two heroes. Here, I could only explore and fight as one at a time, with Aloy the choice for most of my trek through blocky mountains and humid jungle lands. There were other frustrations like the inability to select power-ups. One of Aloy's lines -- "the wilds reward the curious" -- went from a mildly sage observation to an irritating maxim.
Lego Horizon Adventures, however, is generally very pleasant and entertaining. When I changed my character to Teersa, an elder who has "survived 13 grandchildren," I was able to toss exploding carrots or land sharks. The mustachioed Erend, with his eternal love for doughnuts, wielded a giant hammer that recalled Thor's Mjolnir. With a flame upgrade, Erend was more powerful than Aloy against the mechanized beasts.
The wackiness never stops. Dropping a hot dog cart damages enemies considerably more than the tossable bombs found scattered along the battle arena. While the gameplay is similar from area to area, the fighting stages become bigger and more complex as you proceed. A small, inviting pond may freeze you briefly. Sharp briar patches will sting you, eating away at your health.
For adults, who can join in the play by adding an extra controller, the treats include some nostalgic pop culture riffs. Seeing a level titled "Desperately Seeking Sawtooths" evoked a smile. As a fun romp for all ages, Lego Horizon Adventures will probably be one of the season's most requested holiday games.
Lego Horizon Adventures was reviewed on a PlayStation 5. It will be released on Thursday and will also be available on the PC and Nintendo Switch.

Huge Ad Buy Will Promote 'Gladiator II' On Monday: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The studio plans to air the same 60-second trailer on 4,000 TV, radio and digital channels on Monday.
For a snapshot of what movie marketers think it now takes to get the public's attention -- even for a sequel to a popular movie -- consider the astounding stunt that Paramount Pictures has planned for "Gladiator II."
On Monday at 9 p.m. Eastern, Paramount will debut a final 60-second trailer for the film on more than 4,000 television networks, digital platforms, local stations, Spanish-language outlets and radio stations simultaneously.
Based on average audience totals for a Monday evening, the trailer could reach roughly 300 million potential customers, according to Marc Weinstock, Paramount's president of worldwide marketing and distribution. "We aimed to create a big moment to match the scope and grandeur of Ridley Scott's epic film," Mr. Weinstock said.
The promotional tactic is known as a roadblock, and marketers have used them for decades. But the number of channels is typically much smaller. In what was described by Variety magazine in 2009 as the largest roadblock ever, Sony Pictures Entertainment simultaneously aired ads for the disaster movie "2012" on 450 television networks.
Mr. Weinstock would not say how much Paramount is spending on Monday's stunt. According to a "Gladiator II" producer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with the studio, the airtime was relatively inexpensive to purchase -- about $ 2 million in total, with a spot during "Monday Night Football" as the most expensive. Wavemaker, a media agency, helped Paramount coordinate the effort.
Marketing a movie used to require little more than buying ads on NBC on a Thursday night when millions tuned in to watch shows like "ER" and "Friends." With the intense fracturing of the media landscape, however, studios have been forced to conjure up ever more provocative ways to grab attention. A single premiere? How quaint. Paramount staged "Gladiator II" red carpets in Australia, Japan, Ireland, France, Denmark and Britain in recent weeks. On Monday, a premiere in Los Angeles will involve the construction of a faux coliseum on Hollywood Boulevard.
In total, Paramount has easily spent $ 100 million to market "Gladiator II," which arrives in theaters in the United States and Canada on Thursday night. The movie, starring Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington and Connie Nielsen, cost more than $ 200 million to make. Reviews so far have been solid, although some critics have complained that the sequel falls short of the first film, which won the Oscar for best picture in 2001.
Paramount is under pressure to deliver a blockbuster. Although it recently found medium-size hits in "A Quiet Place: Day One" and "Smile 2," Paramount ranks a distant last among Hollywood's major studios in terms of domestic box office market share for the year. And "Gladiator II" has major competition, arriving in theaters at the same time as Universal's heavily marketed "Wicked."
Every movie studio is also fighting a downturn in moviegoing. Streaming services, TikTok and video games have siphoned away audiences. Higher ticket prices have also dented demand. Year-to-date, the North American box office is down about 11 percent from last year -- and 25 percent compared with before the pandemic.

If a Celebrity Orders a Biographical Documentary, Is It Really a Documentary?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Barnes, Brooks

Full text: Real documentarians shine a light on the overlooked and the underprivileged. Real documentarians nudge the world forward. Real documentarians don't get rich.
At least that is what purists will tell you.
Does that mean that R.J. Cutler isn't a real documentarian?
As a vérité filmmaker for the past 31 years, Mr. Cutler has tackled a wide variety of subjects, from politics ("The World According to Dick Cheney") to Vogue magazine ("The September Issue") to e-cigarettes ("Big Vape: The Rise and Fall of Juul"). He has been nominated for an Oscar. He has won three Emmys, including one for "American High," a docuseries that tracked 14 high school students over a year.
But lately Mr. Cutler has been mostly working in the booming subcategory of celebrity docs, landing him at the center of a debate that has been roiling the nonfiction film world. Namely, should celebrity documentaries -- Mr. Cutler has examined Billie Eilish, Martha Stewart, Elton John, Anna Wintour, Marlon Brando and John Belushi -- even be called documentaries? Aren't these films, which are frequently sought out by celebrities (and celebrity estates), closer to glamour shots?
"How honest can you really be?" said Sheila Nevins, the former president of HBO Documentary Films. "These famous people are all very involved in the making of their films. So is the result a biography or an autobiography? Is it a sellout or just a different form?"
Mr. Cutler, 63, said celebrity falls into the latter category -- just a different form, one of many (agitprop, advocacy, expository) that make up the broader genre. He maintains that celebrity films can be every bit as serious, noting that subjects, at least in his movies, don't call the shots.
"The lens, figuratively and literally, is mine," he said.
Simultaneously affable and unyielding, Mr. Cutler is hardly the only esteemed filmmaker to add celebrity to his oeuvre. (Liz Garbus is another.) But he has been more successful than most, selling movies to streaming services for unheard-of prices.
Apple TV+ paid an estimated $ 27 million for his "Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry" in 2019. (Produced with Ms. Eilish's label, Interscope Records, the film cost about $ 5 million to make.) Disney spent $ 32 million for "Elton John: Never Too Late," which Mr. Cutler co-directed with Sir Elton's husband, David Furnish. (It cost an estimated $ 7 million.) Profit is shared by various producers and production companies.
Weighty, issue-oriented documentaries, which have a much harder time attracting viewers, are lucky to sell for a few million dollars. Many don't sell at all.
"We're not trying to chase a marketplace," Mr. Cutler said, referring to his documentary production company, This Machine Filmworks, which he co-owns with Sony Pictures Entertainment. "We believe that documentary can work as popular entertainment and say something about the world at the same time. We're artists who want to impact people's lives."
As for the ethical debate -- how honest can you be with celebrity subjects, should a spouse be co-directing -- Mr. Cutler said he understood why those questions got asked. But he also seemed puzzled as to why he would need to explain himself.
"I'm a contractual final-cut filmmaker," he said flatly.
Ms. Stewart certainly discovered as much. When she agreed to be one of his subjects, she was expecting a collaboration. Instead, she said, Mr. Cutler mostly vetoed her requests for changes to "Martha," which arrived on Netflix on Wednesday.
"We had pages and pages of notes for him, and maybe 4 percent of those suggested changes were actually made," Ms. Stewart said by phone. "I have collaborated on thousands of products and magazines and TV shows -- fabulous designers and writers and photographers. And this is the first showdown I have ever had on a creative project."
Ms. Stewart met with several potential filmmakers after deciding to pursue a documentary. One exploratory discussion with Mr. Cutler took place in her Manhattan office. "I made chicken salad," Ms. Stewart recalled. "He was working on Billie Eilish, which I thought was cool."
The more Mr. Cutler learned about Ms. Stewart's life, the more interested he became. "It's an incredible story -- the first self-made female billionaire in American history, for crying out loud -- and yet she is a very complex character filled with conflicts and contradictions," he said.
They signed a contract in May 2022. According to Ms. Stewart, it included a "collaboration clause."
"While he has final control of the picture," Ms. Stewart said, reading from the contract, "he is obligated to meaningfully consult with you with respect to the development, production, distribution and exploitation of the picture, and to keep you meaningfully and promptly informed of any and all material updates."
Ms. Stewart said Mr. Cutler had not complied. "The lack of communication was glaring, glaring," she said. "I don't work like that. I don't keep people in the dark." She added that her deal entitles her to "share in the profits of the film" and that she is "waiting for an accounting."
"I'm a businesswoman," she said. "I have good lawyers."
Mr. Cutler declined to comment on the film's finances. (Netflix paid seven figures for "Martha," according to a person who worked on the deal and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms are private.) As for the contract, Mr. Cutler said he had shown work-in-progress cuts to Ms. Stewart "three or four times" and "engaged in thoughtful conversations with her and her team about it."
He said there was no such thing as a collaboration clause.
"What she had in her contract, it's the same thing as in all of our contracts," Mr. Cutler said. "I'll show you the film. You'll tell me what you think. I'll tell you how I'm responding. You'll tell me again what you think. I'll tell you again how I'm responding. And that will be that. The final editing decisions are mine."
Some documentarians refuse to preview their work for participants. Mr. Cutler said he didn't think that was fair.
"You've got to start from a position of empathy and responsibility," he said. "They have trusted you with their story. It may be difficult for them to see aspects of it."
"Elton John: Never Too Late," which arrives in theaters on Nov. 15 and on Disney+ in December, seems to have been a happier experience. The film contrasts the rock icon's early heyday -- in particular, a 1974 performance with John Lennon at Madison Square Garden -- with his recent farewell tour and offstage life as a father. It includes the 1976 tape recording with Rolling Stone when he first revealed his sexuality.
The Variety critic Owen Gleiberman, reviewing "Never Too Late" after its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, called it "robustly satisfying and emotional."
Like Ms. Stewart, Mr. Furnish also shopped for a filmmaker. He said that he had zeroed in on Mr. Cutler because of his decades of experience -- that Mr. Cutler knew how to do the "very, very deep dive that we wanted to do." As it turned out, Mr. Cutler already had Mr. John on his wish list of subjects; as a boy in New York, Mr. Cutler attended that 1974 concert at the Garden and never forgot it.
"I'm really happy with how the film came out," Mr. Furnish said, pointing in particular to scenes that involve their sons, Zachary and Elijah. "In a very natural, nonconfrontational way, we're sending a very positive, life-affirming message about domestic happiness, whoever you are."
This Machine Filmworks was named in reference to the statement that Woody Guthrie famously scrawled on his guitar in 1941: "This machine kills fascists." The company employs about 20 people and has 15 films and docuseries in production. One is headed to Apple TV+ and focuses on the current World Series. Another examines Lee Soo-man, known as the king of K-pop, for Amazon's Prime Video.
Another 40 projects are in development.
"We're never going to make a film about something that we don't love just because it's going to sell, because it's too hard," said Trevor Smith, executive vice president of This Machine.
Mr. Cutler's career has taken a circuitous route. He directed live theater in his 20s, pivoted toward serious political documentary in his 30s ("The War Room," "A Perfect Candidate") and then spent a period exploring scripted entertainment, including executive-producing the soapy "Nashville," which lasted six seasons.
All of that, he said, has led him to his current spot in Hollywood -- practicing rigorous vérité filmmaking on topics that people might actually watch.
"I'm looking for a big tent," he said.

American Airlines Loses JetBlue Alliance Appeal
A U.S. appeals court on Friday held that a trial judge correctly found that American Airlines' now-scrapped U.S. Northeast partnership with JetBlue Airways violated federal antitrust law.
Through their partnership, American and JetBlue coordinated schedules and pooled revenue on flights in and out of New York City and Boston. JetBlue terminated the alliance last year as it sought to bolster its efforts to win approval for its now-dropped $ 3.8 billion purchase of Spirit Airlines, but American Airlines pressed ahead with an appeal, saying the trial ruling would prevent the company from entering into any similar future arrangement, including with JetBlue.
The alliance was announced in July 2020 and approved by the Transportation Department just days before the end of Republican President-elect Donald Trump's first administration in January 2021. REUTERS
EARNINGS
Sony Reports Big Profits
On Strong Sales of Games
Sony's profit rose 69 percent in July-September from a year earlier on the back of strong sales of its image sensors, games, music and network services, the Japanese electronics and entertainment company said on Friday.
Quarterly profit was 338.5 billion yen ( $ 2.2 billion), up from 200 billion yen in the year-earlier period, while consolidated quarterly sales edged up 3 percent year-on-year to 2.9 trillion yen.
Tokyo-based Sony's latest quarterly results were boosted by healthy demand around the world for image sensors used in mobile products.
Sales also held up in its video games division. During the latest quarter, 3.8 million PlayStation 5 game consoles were sold globally, compared with 4.9 million units sold the same period a year ago.
Demand remained strong for PS5 game software, according to Sony. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Consumer Sentiment Rises to 7-Month High
U.S. consumer sentiment rose to a seven-month high in early November, with a measure of households' expectations for the future climbing to the highest in more than three years, led by brightening outlooks among Republicans, a survey showed on Friday.
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index climbed to 73.0 this month, the highest since April, from 70.5 in October. The result exceeded the median estimate among economists polled by Reuters for a reading of 71.0.
The survey's expectations index climbed nearly 6 percent to 78.5, the highest since July 2021.
As has been the case for several years now, details of the report showed a wide partisan skew in a survey completed the day before Tuesday's presidential election in which Republican Donald Trump emerged the victor over Democrat Kamala Harris. REUTERS

Game Designer Welcomes Even the Ideas He Might Hate: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The founder of Giant Sparrow says creativity requires pushing boundaries. Its next game will explore "the strangeness of organic life."
Ian Dallas, the founder and creative director of the video game studio Giant Sparrow, happened to be talking about food, but his gastronomical tastes are similar to his design philosophy. "I'm always interested," he said, "in what's the strangest, new intense experience that I can have."
Giant Sparrow's most recent release, What Remains of Edith Finch, is one of the more piquant fusions of narrative and game design of the past decade. What became a collection of short stories about a cursed family of storytellers living in the Pacific Northwest began as a scuba diving simulator.
From the rough prototype to the finished game, Dallas strove to evoke the rush of the sublime; while searching for ways to conjure that feeling, he made one prototype after another. By the alchemy of art, he and his small team ended up with a game that uses a different mechanic for each of the stories it tells about the last day of a character's life. In one scenario, a little girl turns into a cat, an owl, a shark and a man-eating sea monster; in another, a man working at a cannery becomes lost in an internal fantasy while working over a fish-slicing machine.
Dallas's approach to a project can be summed up as experimentation within a given set of parameters. He likes to tell new colleagues that he wants to see things he will hate.
"If I don't see ideas that include some that are just like really out there, then we're not trying hard enough," he said. What might not seem promising early on can plant the seed for inspired creativity down the line.
A couple of years after the success of What Remains of Edith Finch, in January 2019, Dallas started working on a bird simulator prototype to try to get the ideas flowing. He had a longstanding interest in birds. But as with the scuba diving prototype from years before, he did not have an inkling where the idea would take him.
Now Giant Sparrow's three-person team is working in six-week sprints to put together prototypes and gather feedback on its next game, which will also be framed around a collection of short stories. The unnamed game is about a field biologist who studies animals and will explore "the strangeness of organic life," Dallas said during a video chat from his Los Angeles office.
Dallas majored in film as an undergraduate at Yale and spent some time working in television, but he had his eye on writing video games. The more he researched the industry, however, the more he realized that video game writers have little say on the direction a project will take.
"All of the important decisions are made upstream," he said.
To better position himself, Dallas enrolled at the University of Southern California, where he studied game design and spent a couple of years developing prototypes. One caught the attention of Sony, and he secured a deal to develop it into a full game.
Dallas dropped out of his master's program and formed his own company in 2009. Three years later he released The Unfinished Swan (2012), about a young boy who explores a semi-realized kingdom. It won BAFTA Awards for best debut and game innovation, and What Remains of Edith Finch (2017) won best narrative at the Game Awards and the BAFTA for best game.
Past success does not guarantee that future projects will be smooth. Ask just about any video game developer what it is like to see a project through from start to finish and you will learn about false starts, heartbreaking overhauls and late-stage revisions. The next game by Giant Sparrow -- Dallas likens each iteration of his studio to a band that exists to make an album -- has been no different.
"The original premise for the game was a mix of David Attenborough and 'Spirited Away,"' Dallas said, referring to the British biologist whose plummy voice narrates documentaries like "The Blue Planet," and Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-winning animated film.
One of the "early catastrophes" in the design process was Dallas's disappointing realization about nature documentaries. Instead of finding inspiration, he was dismayed by how many adhered to a formula of focusing on an area for a few minutes before radically shifting to another geography and climate. "They work in part because it's like a distraction for a toddler," he said.
It has also been challenging, Dallas said, to design gameplay systems more interesting than what one might expect from the premise -- "like a photographing mini game, or like collecting 10 ladybugs or whatever."
To partially get around this problem, he plans to introduce a number of fantastical creatures. It has been tricky to distinguish them, though, given the monstrous appearance of real animals like star-nosed moles and anglerfish. "Scary can also be boring," he wrote in an email. The right direction, he said, was a mutton-chopped monster created by one of Giant Sparrow's concept artists.
"When we started adding a few slightly goofy elements," Dallas said, "that led us to some stranger and more interesting places."
Dallas wants his new game to help people reflect on the vastly different ways that other species experience the world. He is also interested in "how many bizarre things are going on around us all the time that we aren't really aware of or thinking about."
He continued, "This game is trying to call out just how weird biology is."
The intention is for players to feel a push and pull between themselves and the game world. Dallas pointed to a sequence in which players must try to get something stuck on a giraffe's head, while also coaxing the animal to draw near and angle its head just so.
"I think single-player games often feel like a chess board -- a world that's highly predictable and entirely designed to facilitate the limited set of actions a player is capable of," Dallas wrote. "We'd like our worlds to feel more exploratory and playful."
What seems playful, though, can vary in relation to its surroundings. In one chapter of What Remains of Edith Finch, players assume the role of a baby in a bathtub. The segment was not that emotionally difficult when he first tested it, Dallas said. But it assumes a completely different force in the actual game, he said, "after having played an hour of other stories where you know that every person in this game is going to die."
Similarly to What Remains of Edith Finch, the tone of Giant Sparrow's next game has considerably darkened over its development cycle. Dallas said his team initially tried to capture how mesmerizing animals were, and did not incorporate people at all in early zoology-themed prototypes.
"What we have slowly found our way to is a game where animals feel gross and maybe you have this visceral reaction to, in the way that like, when a caterpillar walks over your finger there's something about all those legs moving that's really disturbing but also fascinating," Dallas said.
To that end, elements of poop and biological decay have become integrated into the game. Dallas is also trying to work in a bit involving caterpillars, which turn themselves into liquid to transform into butterflies. Children are taught to consider the transformation adorable, but he calls it one of the most horrifying processes in nature.
"Hopefully, this game is going to be one of the stranger games that people have experienced," Dallas said. "I'm doing everything I can to make it that way."

Photographing Every President Since Reagan: [National Desk]

Full text: Doug Mills reflects on nearly 40 years of taking photos of presidents.
Election Day is nearly here. For the past two weeks, Times Insider has shared an article about how our election coverage works. Here, the photographer Doug Mills reflects on nearly 40 years of taking photos of presidents.
Through his camera lens, Doug Mills has seen it all: George H.W. Bush playing horseshoes. An emotional Barack Obama. A shirtless Bill Clinton. And he's shared what he's seen with the world.
Mr. Mills, a veteran photographer, has captured pictures of every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan. His portfolio includes images of intimate conversations, powerful podium moments and scenes now seared into the American consciousness -- like the face of President George W. Bush, realizing that America was under attack while he was reading to schoolchildren.
Mr. Mills began his photography career at United Press International before joining The Associated Press. Then, in 2002, he was hired at The New York Times, where his latest assignment has been trailing former President Donald J. Trump. In July, Mr. Mills captured the moment a bullet flew past Mr. Trump's head at a rally in Butler, Pa., and then a photo of Mr. Trump, ear bloodied, raising his fist.
Over the past four decades, cameras and other tools have changed the job considerably, he said. While he once used 35mm SLR film cameras (what photographers used for decades), he now travels with multiple Sony mirrorless digital cameras, which are silent and can shoot at least 20 frames per second. He used to lug around portable dark rooms; now he can transmit images to anywhere in the world directly from his camera, via Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable, in a matter of seconds.
But it's not just the technology that has changed. Campaigns are more image-driven than ever before, he said, thanks to social media, TV ads and coverage that spans multiple platforms. Not to mention, it's a nonstop, 24-hour news cycle. He likens covering an election year to a monthslong Super Bowl.

"It consumes your life, but I love it," Mr. Mills said. "I wouldn't want to be doing anything else."
Mr. Mills, who on election night will be with Mr. Trump at a watch party in Palm Beach, Fla., shared how one image of each president he's photographed throughout his career came together. -- Megan DiTrolio
Nov. 8, 1988. This image was taken on election night or in the early hours of the next morning, as President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, watched as early results arrived in the presidential race between George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis. The first thing you might notice is the size of their TV. We were upstairs in the White House in the Reagans' private quarters. It was a unique photography opportunity -- not to mention, my first time photographing a president in his private residence. This is not something we would ever do now, because elections have turned to a different format. Now, presidents are surrounded by advisers -- this was much more low-key.

June 7, 1991. President Bush was a huge fan of horseshoes, though you didn't see him playing too often. The pit, which he added in 1989, was just steps from the Oval Office. Mr. Bush had challenged members of the military, specifically those involved in Operation Desert Storm, to a tournament. You can see troops by the private swimming pool, as well as reporters. Mr. Bush and his son Marvin were victorious in each match. I was fortunate enough to play horseshoes with the president a number of times, in that same pit.
July 11, 1993. The Clinton family was on a family vacation on the island of Oahu in Hawaii, and a group of photographers had tagged along. I was walking around the Kahala Hilton hotel when I saw President Bill Clinton playing Frisbee (I can't remember whom he was throwing it to) and swimming with his daughter, Chelsea, left, and her friend. I asked one of the agents if I could take a picture; he said I couldn't take one from where I was standing, but I could do so from the sand of the public beach. This picture ended up on a lot of front pages -- and it was also the only time I've ever photographed a president shirtless. About a day later, there was a huge flood in Iowa, so, of course, this picture turned into a moment. On the way home, we stopped in Iowa, where Mr. Clinton helped fill sandbags.
Sept. 11, 2001. This was one of the most remarkable days of my career. At a visit to Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Fla., President George W. Bush's chief of staff, Andrew Card, whispered into his ear to inform him of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. At the time, I didn't know what Mr. Card had said. I found out days later, after I asked him: Mr. President, he said, "a second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack." I was with The A.P. at the time, and joined Mr. Bush on Air Force One as he left Florida. In the following days, I traveled with Mr. Bush to ground zero.
Jan. 5, 2016. Here, in the East Room of the White House, President Barack Obama was announcing executive actions to expand background checks for some firearm purchases and strengthen federal enforcement of the nation's gun laws. He grew emotional while speaking about the people, including children, who had died from countless and senseless gun attacks. I had not seen Mr. Obama cry; when the president was crying, everyone else in the room was, too. It was a remarkable moment. The next time I saw Mr. Obama cry was at his last campaign spot for his second term.
Aug. 28, 2020. Here, you can see President Trump getting off Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, following a campaign rally in Londonderry, N.H. A light rain was falling, and this bolt of lightning streaked across the sky just as I was photographing Mr. Trump. I had a tighter lens on my camera and was able to capture the moment in which it appears that the bolt is coming from Mr. Trump. It was the right lens at the right time. You can instantly tell it's him, even in this shadow. I always say Mr. Obama was the most photogenic president, but Mr. Trump is instantly recognizable.
Feb. 21, 2023. This is President Biden delivering remarks ahead of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, at the royal castle in Warsaw. This photo was very difficult to take. I was looking for unique angles and noticed the president's silhouette as a reflection on the glass. I camped out at that spot for five to 10 minutes to wait for the right moment, then got this image. It was different from the standard podium speech image.

Called the Love Doctor, He Couldn't Heal Himself: [Correction]

Full text: He was hounded by a fat-phobic press, but as Dawn Porter's new documentary shows, he was a transformational presence from the start.
Beginning in the late 1970s, while making the transition from background singer to phenomenal solo act, Luther Vandross shaped the sound of commercialism as much as he shaped the sound of modern American music. He recorded lucrative jingles for Juicy Fruit, Miller beer and even Gino's pizza. During the Gino's session, he was asked to personify a sizzling hot pie coming from the oven, and he improvised by quickly dropping his tenor into the hadal zone of his body and retrieving it, like a free diver collecting pearls.
"I could see the control room just jumping up and clapping," he says in one of the interviews laced throughout "Luther: Never Too Much," a new documentary by Dawn Porter (in theaters).
It was a genius stroke. He developed a signature as recognizable as Whitney Houston's record-length notes or Mariah Carey's fluted crystalline range. Vandross's musical intelligence predated what is obvious in the era of TikTok: A distinct sound is worth the price of gold.
Vandross left a full, rich archive, yet there's still an emptiness at the heart of it that manages to come through in Porter's engrossing work. She starts her chronology with Vandross's second birth. In an interview clip early in the film, Oprah asks Vandross when he knew he could sing. He answers that he decided to sing after seeing Dionne Warwick perform in 1963 in Brooklyn. "I wanted to be able to affect people the way she affected me that day," he explains. Notice how he didn't specify a date. Notice how he knew the voice was always there. He just chose the way he wanted to use it.
In the film, a white interviewer asks Vandross, who grew up in the Alfred E. Smith Houses on the Lower East Side, if he was poor then. His response is earnest if not amused. "My impression of life growing up was great." He knew something that she did not: Money is only one kind of wealth.
In her essay on Black aesthetics, "Characteristics of Negro Expression," Zora Neale Hurston reveled in our desire to gild language, ideas, stories, gesture, clothing in resplendent layers of flamboyance. "There can never be enough of beauty, let alone too much," she observed. Hurston wrote her oracular essay in 1934, nearly 20 years before Luther Vandross was born, but she named a tradition that he would uphold in his own time.
Before he would perform as part of the group Luther or go out on his own, Vandross sang backup for everyone: Carly Simon, Diana Ross, Donna Summer, Chaka Khan, Bette Midler, "Sesame Street." Porter draws a new cosmology of a freer soul and R&B sound drifting down from Philadelphia in the late '60s and '70s. The music journalist Danyel Smith describes it in the documentary as an adult Motown, a scene that wasn't worried about matching outfits and "being in bed by midnight."
One afternoon, a friend of Vandross's, the guitarist Carlos Alomar, was called to record some music for David Bowie, who was in town to work on what would become his 1975 album, "Young Americans." Vandross tagged along, as his friends often did when others scored an enviable gig. During a lull, Vandross hummed his own arrangement of the chorus. Bowie was dazzled. Usually, in a film like this, an anointment from a white artist serves as a legitimization, a reference letter from a prestigious institution. Instead, Porter uses it to underline how Vandross transmogrified everything he touched.
Another great music documentary, "Summer of Soul" (2021), reminds us of the synchronicities between the explorations coming out of the Apollo Theater in Harlem and NASA's Apollo 11 mission: Both changed the course of human history, albeit from different vantage points of Earth.
When Vandross was ready to release his own music as a solo artist, none of the record labels would touch him; he had to ask his friends, including Cissy Houston, to lend their time for free. He directs them to play a song he wrote. At first, they were taken aback by its unusual bass line. The demo session became "Never Too Much," which the film understands as his most enduring masterpiece.
Though there's a deep trove to pull from, Porter keeps the focus on Vandross's live performances. His honesty and comfort onstage, along with his theatrics and exuberance, made him a legend.
Collective cultural processing has become its own genre of entertainment. Much of the work of contemporary documentaries is to reveal past pop-cultural metanarratives as apocryphal. They push us as viewers to reckon with a past that was shaped by a coterie of media organizations and anchors who were often serving their own best interests in capitalizing on the most salacious and scandalous stories. Perhaps, also, these documentaries help us practice our current media literacy.
Here, Porter makes the case that fat phobia terrorized Vandross and minimized his accomplishments. Music had its own Jim Crow, and Black artists were segregated on stages, in record stores, by genre. Vandross refused to be diminished. He saw his eight Grammys and 40 million albums sold as momentum for the civil rights movement. But it was his public weight fluctuations that interviewers pressed him on. The media didn't hide their fascination and repulsion at his appetite. People debated their preferences for "big Luther" or "little Luther" on television and in my high school.
For a while, he retaliated with sly pleasure. After Eddie Murphy took gibes at his size and eating habits during his 1987 stand-up special "Raw," Vandross wheeled out a prop basket of Kentucky Fried Chicken at a show. If Porter wanted to make a sequel to "The Substance," she has plenty of material. The film understands the way food is a demon that can live inside of you, too. Vandross told friends that food was a harmless vice, but years of disordered eating and weight fluctuations took their toll; he had diabetes and, eventually, suffered a stroke. And those were only the physical manifestations.
The media's relentless obsession with his weight pushed Vandross to withdraw from public view. Porter frames his reclusiveness as protection, which only made the rabid probing worse. His sexuality was scrutinized almost as much as his body; once, after a dramatic weight loss, there was even a rumor that he had contracted H.I.V. Another time, he watched a pastor on television say a prayer after a rumor circulated that he had died. Vandross, rightfully so, refused to entertain the violations of privacy. He owed the public nothing but "my best effort," he said. "That's all."
Vandross's voice touched listeners' hearts, and other parts of their anatomy, too. Vandross sang about love so much that fans gave him an honorary degree in it, nicknaming him the Love Doctor. Vandross knew a song was not a body, as the poet Saeed Jones once put it, but he poured so much of himself into his music and performances that the public mistook his genuine emotion for libidinousness, a common mistake given that the era would expand to include Keith Sweat and Maxwell. (Though America has a way of doing that to all Black men.)
The 1988 song "Any Love," which he described as his most autobiographical, included the lyrics "Now all you need is a chance to try any love." Max Szadek, his assistant, interpreted that as desperation. "He wasn't seeking love -- he was seeking any love," he tells Porter. But Vandross always seemed to sing with faith, not fear. "I don't consider myself unlovable," he told an offscreen interviewer. "But I'm still waiting."
The fulcrum of the film is heartbreak -- ours, not his -- that someone responsible for shaping the universal feeling of falling in love never experienced it himself. Acceptance arrived in his 2003 song "Dance With My Father" that finds peace in growing up well-loved in a home with both parents.
Vandross drifted back into the collective consciousness last summer when Solange Knowles (under the moniker of her art studio, Saint Heron) released a collection of handblown glassware. The beautiful objects were displayed in conjunction with a new installation: large screens showing a live 1989 performance of Vandross singing "A House Is Not a Home" at Wembley Stadium in England.
At Vandross's funeral in 2005 (the singer was 54), the ever-regal Dionne Warwick was helped to the lectern to give a eulogy. The film is punctuated with interviews with her and details about their lifelong friendship and collaboration. (She first sang the lyrics that Vandross readorned and that later inspired Knowles's beautiful home décor.) Warwick's speech is brief. "His legacy, will live on, forever."

A New Age For Some Old Friends: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's not exactly a "Forrest Gump" sequel, but the new movie "Here" does reunite the stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, and the filmmakers -- the director Robert Zemeckis, screenwriter Eric Roth, composer Alan Silvestri -- of that 1994 Oscar-winning favorite. Like the earlier film, the new one also travels across decades, with an unheard-of perspective.
In this case, though, the viewpoint is the camera's: "Here" is filmed almost entirely from one locked-off shot, with a camera positioned in what becomes the living room of a century-old New England home. There are no cutaways or traditional close-ups; no montages or wide-angle transitions. It's an experiment in cinematic formalism, inspired by Richard McGuire's ambitious, genre-expanding 2014 graphic novel of the same name.
Though the story starts with the dinosaurs and travels all the way through the present day with different characters, it focuses mostly on Hanks and Wright's boomer couple, Richard and Margaret, whose lives are, by turns, mundane and historicized in that single setting. The furniture and styles change, and with the help of A.I., the stars were also digitally de-aged.
"It really is about, why do we remember the moments that we remember?" Wright said.
In a video interview this week from New York, she and Hanks spoke about what attracted them to the film (the answer was largely Zemeckis), the enduring appeal of "Forrest Gump," and what drives their choices now. The technical challenges of "Here" also energized them: There was no crafting -- or saving -- a performance in the edit; no way to cut around a missed mark except to redo a whole scene. "Tom and I, we're so spoiled, we don't ever want to shoot conventional format again," Wright said of typical cinematography.
Early reviews have been mixed, with some critics balking at the visual conceit, and the de-aging. Wright, 58, was having none of it. "It is so simple and beautiful and real and human," she said. "We all have experienced something in this movie."
Hanks, 68, pondered why cynicism has become, as he said, "the default."
"I remain driven by this never-ending curiosity I have, about how it is true that good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people," he said. The response could be cynicism, he said, but only if you're seeking "the lowest common denominator."
The conversation, which was punctuated by Hanks's impression of Zemeckis and by Wright's laughter, also touched on the 2020 documentary "The Truffle Hunters," which Zemeckis recommended. These are edited excerpts.
The movie came together because Tom, you and Robert Zemeckis were talking about what was left to do in the world of film -- is that right?
HANKS That's a good way of putting it. Bob and I talk all the time -- like old war veterans, about various campaigns we've been in and life in general. "The Truffle Hunters," I was enraptured by this movie because, No. 1, I love documentaries. And the idea of old men and dogs, and figuring out the entire economy of truffles in general, is pretty fascinating.
So much of that movie was shot in a locked-off tableau form. And there was something about how long they went on, and yet how invigorating all these scenes were, that stuck in my head. I said, I wonder how much of that you could get away with in a feature film. And he literally said, funny you should ask, and he showed me the graphic novel.
WRIGHT I immediately saw it visually: those panels, those cutouts of another piece of furniture on that page, is going to lead me into what the next era is. I was like, 'Go for it, Bob. If anybody can do it, you can do it.'
HANKS Really, we were talking about the theme of impermanence and presence, and how you could tell stories about people who live thousands or hundreds of years ago, or 80 years ago, and they did not realize they were living in the past. I don't know a lot of movies that are made about that topic. But Bob always has this other cinematic demand of himself, to do it in some form that no one has either bothered with or dreamed of or trusted enough. And that's why I'll follow Bob into hell if he's got an idea, and see where it will lead us.
How did you recalibrate your acting style for this?
HANKS We did a week's worth of a workshop in a hotel ballroom in L.A. We locked off an iPhone, and we had approximations of the set. We had to just figure out the technical parts of, you know, walking into our own close-ups and being in our own two-shots. The studio executives were always saying, "You're sure this is going to work? This has never been done before." Well, who in the world do you think you're talking to? Bob Zemeckis does nothing but make movies that have never been done.
WRIGHT [On set, they felt] I don't know if it's going to work. Let's go for it. And every single scene, sometimes we would nail it in three to five takes and then others, we had to do it 45 times. We had to rehearse and rehearse so that we all got in sync: You walked into your own close-up, but we still see the other character in the background. It was just a dance.
Did you get to approve how you looked as your younger selves?
WRIGHT No -- they nailed it. Because it's literally data they derived from interviews Tom and I did when we were 18, 19, 21; still photographs; stuff that is online. They deposit it into this machine, and they made us up to look 17 -- we wore the costumes, we had girdles when we had to be young. For the aging part, that was a little bit of visual effect added to prosthetics.
Did you watch dailies? Or playback?
WRIGHT There were no dailies because there was no coverage. We got to see immediate playback after every take.
HANKS I will not watch playback on a standard movie because I am going to be the least objective about anything that I see.
But here, it was the most important tool we had to judge ourselves as 17-year-old or 37-year-old versions of ourselves. I had no self-consciousness about looking at the playback except, are my shoulders in the right place? Do we have enough energy? Are our eyes actually, you know, focused the way they can be when you're young -- or burdened when you're old?
WRIGHT Tom's right that we had to be very discerning of ourselves. Like, OK, maybe I need to think of something that is more innocent, that will take away the years of life that are in here. We were acting physically, raising the octave in our voice, to be a 17-year-old. But A.I. gave us the innocence in the eyes and the youthful skin. And got rid of the saggy neck.
Your profession can be tough on people as they age. Did working on a movie where you see both your younger self and an older version of your character bring that into relief?
HANKS I get that every time I walk past the refrigerator -- all these pictures that go back 30 or 40 years. I know I don't look like that anymore. And I'm comfortable [with that].
The movie shows your characters get together, and of course you have co-starred before. Did you have to have any further conversation about what attracted them, what propels their marriage?
HANKS I'm going to say no because --
But she is nodding.
WRIGHT We talked about it so much, though, Tom, when we were rehearsing: Who are these people and why he is so fixed on, "We need to stay in this house."
HANKS That, to me, was the precursor to the lines we were saying; it's all there. Robin, maybe you and I were just, you know, fighting the way a couple would anyway, as we're trying to figure it out.
Were you concerned at all that these emotional moments might be overshadowed, for audiences, by the technical audacity, the de-aging, all of that?
WRIGHT I didn't think about any of that. I just wanted to be in sync with Bob's vision, and Eric Roth. You know, sitting around that table in L.A., really talking about the full arc of these people and a life that they spent together. That's the theme of this movie: What do you appreciate the most about these moments in your life, and why?
HANKS The technical aspects, they have been in every movie I've made with Bob. In "Forrest Gump," they said, isn't it kind of creepy that you can be in the same room as John F. Kennedy now? Isn't that diabolical in some ways? And I remember Bob saying, you mean we could lie on film? Well, guess what? You can.
With "Castaway," there was no musical score for a big chunk of the movie. And some people said, How do you get away with that?
There's all kinds of stuff that they say, will movies ever be the same again because of this thing? And the answer is yes, of course, because in the sensibilities and I guess in some ways the morals of the filmmaker, it's plainly evident what the final product is.
Is "Forrest Gump" a project, or an era of moviemaking -- or moviegoing -- that you feel sentimental about?
WRIGHT It's a movie that I will always feel sentimental about, not only because it's a great movie. Sentimental working with these guys because it was such a great experience.
HANKS It is this extraordinary amalgam that stands completely on its own and never has to be repeated. And thank God we never bothered trying to make another one. Why put a hat on a hat?
Do people quote "Gump" to you?
WRIGHT Constantly. Do you get it?
HANKS All the time. I get "Run Forrest, run" all the time. [In Forrest's voice] "Mama always told me" ----
WRIGHT [In Forrest's voice] "Life's a box of chocolates."
HANKS "No, you idiot." I get that sometimes, from Gary [Sinise's character, Lieutenant Dan]. I like to compare -- that is like people giving me a nickel when they see me.
WRIGHT Totally.
HANKS Hey, here's a nickel for you: I'm going to show you this quote that meant so much to us. I still get letters all the time saying, every year the family gets together, we do what we did back in 1995, when it first came out on home video. We all watch it, from beginning to end. Right now, someone is watching that movie from beginning to end somewhere in the world. And it's landing with that same sense of comfort and familiarity.
There are some different takes on Jenny, Robin's character, including that she was punished for her choices -- which were reflective of the choices of many young women in a generation that had social and economic liberty for the first time. She chooses a freewheeling life, and she dies. There is a sense that this is kind of an anti-feminist role. What do you think?
WRIGHT No! It's not about that. People have said she's a Voldemort to Forrest. I wouldn't choose that as a reference, but she was kind of selfish. I don't think it's a punishment that she gets AIDS. She was so promiscuous -- that was the selfishness that she did to Forrest. He was in love with her from Day 1. And she was just flighty and running and doing coke and hooking up with a Black Panther. And then she gets sick and says, "This is your child. But I'm dying." And he still takes her: "I'll take care of you at Mama's house." I mean, it's the sweetest love story.
"Here" and "Forrest Gump" obviously are not the same movie. But they do have some of the same undercurrents -- social, cultural and economic shifts in the background. What matters to you when you're telling stories that have that kind of scope?
HANKS I can't do anything unless I think it's absolutely fascinating. I've got to feel like I'm signing up for the best undergraduate class in a subject, and our study plan is to make a movie about it.
Is there an era that you would have like to have lived in, that you didn't experience?
WRIGHT I would've loved to have been an adult in the '60s. What's yours, Tom?
HANKS I would have liked to have been in my 20s in the late 1940s, like New York from 1946 to '56. Radio was still huge. Movies were getting better and better; music down on 52nd Street. [The writer] Nick Pileggi, a friend of mine, said that he would listen to music on 52nd Street for $ 2, and just drink at the bar at 11 o'clock. Everybody from [Charles] Mingus to Dinah Washington to the Chico [Hamilton Quintet]. And it wasn't until TV came along and started altering everybody's social practices that it began to slow down. If I could've turned 25 in 1946, I would have loved to have been in New York.
When you're in projects that take on this sweep of history, has it changed your own perception of time?
WRIGHT [With "Here"] I feel like we're talking sense about who we all are.
HANKS Well, not because of the work I've done, but because of the number of birthdays that I've had. I'm 68, and I must say, I view time differently. I used to think a day was 36 hours long, and now I'm convinced it's only 18. I never get done what I want. I guess I'm aware of being on the back nine -- that time is a very, very finite thing. And to squander it, I think it's a sin.
So I ponder everything that I do from a perspective of how many minutes do I have left. And this is not a morbid thing! I think I'm being liberated by the fact that this is all in my own power. How much joy and compassion and empathy am I going to take part in, and share at the same time? Let's get cracking! Let's go.

The Millenniums Keep Passing, but the View Never Changes: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tom Hanks and Robin Wright reunite onscreen for a drama that showcases generations of existence.
"Here" is an aeon-spanning experimental collage by Robert Zemeckis that plants the camera in one spot for give-or-take three billion years. The lens is static; the span, epic. An acre of New Jersey braves meteors, an ice age and dinosaurs. Sometime between the Pleistocene and Columbus, a deer tiptoes past. Alan Silvestri's score swells triumphantly. Evolution!
Mostly, however, we're staring at two houses. The first was erected before the American Revolution and belongs to William Franklin (Daniel Betts), a British loyalist who calls his kite-flying father Benjamin Franklin (Keith Bartlett) a terrorist. Secure in its place in history, the colonial mansion lords its importance over the second house, the lesser house, that you'd never drive out of your way to visit. But these humble digs are the star. Around 1900, the home's walls get built around the camera, and in turn, the film builds itself around the mundane goings-on inside. Hovering midway between the sofa and the kitchen, we witness a century-plus of holidays, lazy days, kisses, arguments. Nothing worth a commemorative plaque. It's a tribute to banality.
Richard McGuire's groundbreaking graphic novel of the same name and conceit used comic panels as a special effect, overlapping anonymous figures into a blurry rumination on time. One page illustrates the chronic popularity of Twister. Another captures the progression of swears: "Nincompoop." "Dweeb." "Dirt bag."
Zemeckis can be more interested in pixels than people. But this time, he wants recognizable people, too -- heck, he wants movie stars -- so he and Eric Roth tighten the screenplay's focus to one family across six decades. There are glimpses of other characters: two Indigenous lovers (Joel Oulette and Dannie McCallum), a snippy suffragist (Michelle Dockery), a jazzy inventor and his wife (David Fynn and Ophelia Lovibond), and a modern family (Nicholas Pinnock and Nikki Amuka-Bird) who exist so close to our era that they come across bland.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The design team does a fantastic job delineating the years. Yet, the film treats everyone else like parentheses around the baby boomers Richard and Margaret (played by a de-aged Tom Hanks and Robin Wright), who fall in love as teenagers. Infatuated and naïve, Margaret coos, "I could spend the rest of my life here." Cut to the young couple pregnant and married (in that order) and inheriting both the furniture and the mistakes of the groom's parents (Paul Bettany and Kelly Reilly).
This is being flogged as a "Forrest Gump" reunion with Zemeckis, Roth, Hanks and Wright teaming up for another film that slavers over the '60s and '70s. Except where Forrest accidentally became the world's most interesting man, "Here" thinks life is like a box of regrets. Richard, a would-be artist who hawks life insurance, is smothered by his sense of duty. He's a truculent take on Jimmy Stewart in "It's a Wonderful Life," and if a story arc is your thing, you can decide he's the antagonist. To Wright's frustrated Margaret, this house is more than a framing device -- it's a trap.
The proscenium setup encourages Zemeckis to shoplift from "Death of a Salesman." Since close-ups are rare, he's directed the actors to play to the rafters and over-enunciate the themes with plucky theatricality. "Time flies!" Hanks grins. Nothing's subtle. But the commitment becomes charming, like a pageant where all the children are wearing mustaches.
The eerily filtered faces of the two leads command attention, especially with Richard, a drinker, thickening at the jowls in ways we know Hanks won't. The visual effects were done in collaboration with the A.I. company Metaphysic, who placed 4th on "America's Got Talent" in 2022 with their synthetic singing Elvis. The effort to age Hanks and Wright from high school to retirement distracts from the we're-all-just-ordinary-folks-here intentions. We must remind ourselves that Richard and Margaret represent patterns, not personalities, releasing them from the pressure to shoulder a narrative.
Don't force a plot to emerge. Better to experience "Here" like open-eyed meditation, nodding at connections and ideas so fragile they'd disintegrate if said aloud. The roof leaks, Margaret's water breaks. A man dies in the influenza epidemic, a woman dies from Covid. Why, I wondered, were the people of the past more inventive -- more Zemeckis-ian -- than the people of today? Does the 21st century have an equivalent to shopworn footage of The Beatles on Ed Sullivan? Around when a normal movie would have a dramatic climax, a mirror is pushed onscreen to reflect what's behind the camera. Look! A stove! Then I reflected on my own setting. What existed before this movie theater? How many deer tiptoed here?
Richard and Margaret's marriage is pained with fleeting joys. When the film is crammed full of their bittersweet memories, it pivots to celebrate the act of forgetting. Margaret, past her breaking point of yearning to be anywhere else but this very spot, says with a smile, "I love it here." Life isn't so bad when you zoom out for the big picture.
Here
Rated PG-13 for a few shots of lust through the ages, plus brief language. Running time: 1 hour 44 minutes. In theaters.

Full text: Everyone has secrets to conceal in Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, a supernatural thriller with parallel timelines.
You're utterly alone. Blood drips onto snow. A fanged entity slashes your significant other. A monstrous chase ends in death. Just in time for Halloween, five affecting horror games are full of harrowing alienation and loneliness.
Life Is Strange: Double Exposure
Reviewed on the PlayStation 5. Also available on the PC, Switch and Xbox Series X|S.
Forget the jump scares in the narrative-rich Life Is Strange: Double Exposure. Not exclusively a horror story, this L.G.T.B.Q.-friendly supernatural thriller presents unsettling moments from the get-go. It marks the welcome return of the smart sleuth Max Caulfield (voiced brilliantly by Hannah Telle). In the opening scenes, Max and her wry friend Safi explore an abandoned bowling alley. You can almost smell decades-old dust and mold in the ramshackle structure, which is complete with a creepy smiling bowling ball mascot and graffiti proclaiming "Hail, Satan!"
Max, with brown shoulder-length hair and a camera always with her, is a well-liked artist in residence for a bucolic college. It's Christmastime, and a lone skater glides across a frozen pond. Yet members of Abraxas, a student group, seem to be plotting something. The campus's visual beauty hides ugly human lies and something sinister to come. Everyone, including Max, has secrets to conceal.
When Safi is found murdered on a snowy bluff, Max begins an investigation using her signature cunning, hints from texts and something like Discord. But it's a new superpower, the ability to move between timelines, that helps the most.
One of the times that Max enters a starry portal, she's able to thwart a nosy investigator looking for clues. He has cornered Max's friend Moses. In a parallel timeline, Max saves Moses, a holiday-light-loving nerd, by sneaking into his lab, stealing evidence and leaving before the investigator notices.
The effect of moving to a parallel timeline is like opening a glowing golden curtain to another dimension. This time-renting game play never becomes boring.
The plot and dialogue, curious and twisting, were written primarily by a team of women and queer writers, a rarity in games. The budding romances are full of hope, desire, fear of loss and (occasionally) witty repartee during flirtatious moments. (But once, a line of dialogue intended to be humorous completely spoils the gravity of a dark moment.) Exchanges about relationships and mental health issues, including Safi's difficult childhood, make this series as important now as Sassy magazine was in the 1990s. Telle, the voice actor, said in an interview that playing Max allowed her "to embrace my struggle as an artist and step into my power as a woman."
"I have found strength," Telle added, "in portraying Max's extraordinary powers and I've explored my own vulnerability through her moments of self-doubt."
Just as there are varying degrees of subterfuge here, there is joy if you choose to seek it out while sleuthing the supernatural. Art fills the college's halls and walls, including a photo exhibit by Max. And there are cat photos, cat paintings, cat fashion for Max and an adorable, hissing feline who shows up at her doorstep.
During interrogations, two or three questions to ask pop up onscreen, and the ones I posed were said to affect the story's outcome, although I wasn't precisely sure how. And although Max carefully quizzes almost everyone around her about the murder -- friends, students, even a potential lover with a penchant for cheesy standup comedy -- she uncharacteristically leaves Moses alone. Overall, though, Double Exposure is doubly stupendous.
Mouthwashing
Reviewed on the PC.
Because its grim, fatalist essence played devious games with my mind, Mouthwashing became one of my most nightmarish game experiences. It's set in a cavernous, old space freighter that crashes, probably because the captain purposely veered off course. Though its graphics are of the original PlayStation era, the sparks that sprayed down as I ran through otherwise pitch-black corridors augmented a feeling of panic and claustrophobia.
The crew members were nervous and worried as they sniped at one another, concerned the food supply would run out. An odd horse mascot suddenly appeared in a doorway and said dubiously optimistic things in a garbled voice. Mouthwashing is weirdness done right.
Jimmy, the new captain, is disliked by the small crew. He bakes a cake for his own birthday, but the party is anxiety-ridden, somewhat like the family Thanksgiving no one wants to attend. Curly, the original captain, is wrapped in oozing bandages but still alive on a gurney, an incongruous, beautiful orange sunset mural behind him. One of his eyes bugs out as I open his mouth to deliver Oxy, dulling his pain. I was keeping him alive, but he has put the crew on a path to certain demise.
Once, when I gave Curly his drug, the screen went black and screams were heard.
Jimmy may be losing it himself, and his fraught hallucinations are among the most affecting I've seen. During one, Jimmy walks through a mazelike cargo hold. The use of sound during an unlit sequence is utterly unsettling and disturbing. What is it? An insane stowaway? The ship imploding? What Jimmy eventually sees by the dim blue light of his code scanner is terrifying. The crew's existences get much worse from there.
Fear the Spotlight
Reviewed on the PC. Also available on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S.
Fear the Spotlight, crafted by a husband-and-wife team, tells the tale of two teenagers, one punky, one bookish. Set inside a 1990s Sunnyside High that becomes only somewhat frightening, the old-school puzzle-solving adventure is the first published by Blumhouse's game division.
While it is mild fun with its Ouija board, haunting phone calls and stealth action to avoid death, it will be scary primarily to a middle school audience who likes "Goosebumps." Moments that hit home included one teenager's need to use an asthma inhaler when things became tense. And the bond between the teenagers as they conquer the fire and monsters felt warm and real.
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead
Reviewed on the PlayStation 5. Also available on the PC and Xbox Series X|S.
The Road Ahead features Alex, the film series's most compelling character. Yes, there's another inhaler here, needed when Dark Angels are near. You must be completely silent because these flightless batlike entities who knuckle-walk like apes have super sensitivity to sound. And the desire to kill you.
The game's pacing, however, feels uneven. Fear is most palpable early, when you're navigating a mysterious ranch and don't know the controls well. The key here is to proceed extremely slowly. In the first minutes, a likable boyfriend shockingly meets his demise, leaving Alex to fend for herself. She's smart and capable, but the pair could have endured great terror together.
I enjoyed pouring sand over water puddles to silence my sneaking movements. The dread returned in the last half-hour, which was rife with wild trepidation as I avoided a Dark Angel looming just a foot away. But the ending was too depressingly bleak and the minimal hope offered didn't satisfy.
Until Dawn
Reviewed on the PlayStation 5. Also available on the PC.
Until Dawn, a remake of a 2015 horror tale told in one-hour chapters, is most notable because it stars Rami Malek as the bro-ey owner of a sprawling mountain lodge. The eerie environs are inhabited by a sadistic killer and sharp-fanged wendigos. Between chapters you meet an over-the-top psychoanalyst, often better in his role than the actors are during their stories.
This version features enhanced graphics but retains the sometimes groan-worthy dialogue of the original. I pressed action buttons to avoid gruesome calamities until I found an ending not in the original. But the controls can be wonky. I couldn't even shine a flashlight on a sign on a dark road. It was as though my brain had no control of my muscles.

Full text: Deep in the vault of the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan on a late-spring day, the curator Robinson McClellan was sorting through a collection of cultural memorabilia. There were postcards signed by Picasso, a vintage photograph of a French actress and letters from Brahms and Tchaikovsky.
When McClellan came across Item No. 147, he froze:
"I thought, 'What's going on here? What could this be?"' McClellan said. "I didn't recognize the music."
McClellan, who is also a composer, snapped a photo of the manuscript and played it at home on a digital piano. Could it really be Chopin? He had his doubts: The work was unusually volcanic, opening with quiet, dissonant notes that erupt into crashing chords. He sent a photograph to Jeffrey Kallberg, a leading Chopin scholar at the University of Pennsylvania.
"My jaw dropped," Kallberg said. "I knew I had never seen this before."
After testing the manuscript's paper and ink, analyzing its handwriting and musical style, and consulting outside experts, the Morgan has come to a momentous conclusion: The work is likely an unknown waltz by Frédéric Chopin, the great fantasist of the Romantic era, the first such discovery in more than half a century.
The finding may prompt debate in the classical music field, where reports of unearthed masterpieces are sometimes greeted skeptically, and where there is a history of fakes and forgeries. But there have also been significant discoveries in recent years: A library in Leipzig, Germany, announced in September that it had found a copy of a 12-minute Mozart string trio.
Newly discovered works by Chopin, who died in 1849 at 39, probably of tuberculosis, are rare. While he is one of music's most beloved figures -- his heart, pickled in a jar of alcohol, is encased in a church in Warsaw -- he was less prolific than other composers, writing about 250 pieces, almost entirely for solo piano.
The manuscript at the Morgan, which it says is from between 1830 and 1835, when Chopin was in his early 20s, has several peculiarities. Though believed to be complete, the work is shorter than Chopin's other waltzes -- only 48 measures long with a repeat, or about 80 seconds. The piece, in the key of A minor, has unusual dynamic markings, including a triple forte, signifying maximum volume, near the start.
But the Morgan says it is confident the waltz is authentic, pointing to several Chopin hallmarks.
"We have total confidence in our conclusion," McClellan said. "Now it's time to put it out there for the world to take a look and form its own opinions."
The star pianist Lang Lang, who recently recorded the waltz for The New York Times at Steinway Hall in Manhattan, said the work felt like Chopin to him. The jarring opening, he said, evokes the harsh winters of the Polish countryside.
"This is not the most complicated music by Chopin," he added, "but it is one of the most authentic Chopin styles that you can imagine."
Born to a French father and a Polish mother in a village outside Warsaw in 1810, Chopin left Poland in 1830, when he was 20. He settled in Paris, quickly establishing himself as a poet at the keyboard whose music conjured new realms of emotion.
Chopin's separation from his family and his fears for the future of Poland might have contributed to the pained quality of his music from this time. In the early 1830s, Poland was in armed rebellion against the Russian Empire, which had occupied parts of the country. Chopin never returned to his homeland.
"Father despairs -- he doesn't know what to do, and he has no one to help raise up mother," he wrote in a diary while traveling in Germany in 1831. "And here I stand by idly -- and here I stand with empty hands. I only moan, expressing my pain from time to time at the piano."
Once asked by an aristocrat in Paris to explain the melancholy of his music, Chopin invoked the Polish word "zal," meaning nostalgia or regret.
Alan Walker, a noted Chopin biographer, said zal was palpable in shorter pieces like the waltzes, which Chopin infused with a depth of emotion that had previously been reserved for far grander works. Waltzes had been a cheery staple of ballrooms. But Chopin's were never meant for dancing.
Chopin, who did not write symphonies, operas or oratorios, was not always seen as a serious composer.
"It never occurred to our forefathers that there could be more musical substance in a short waltz or mazurka by Chopin than in an entire symphony by Boccherini," Walker said.
While experts believe Chopin wrote as many as 28 waltzes, only eight were published in his lifetime, and nine after his death. The rest were lost or destroyed.
Some of his waltzes sparkle with energy and sophistication, like this "Grande Valse Brillante."
Others are playful romps, like the Minute Waltz, which has endured in popular culture, performed by both Bugs Bunny and Barbra Streisand.
Still others are morose meditations, like the Waltz in B Minor.
Many pianists of the era delighted in dazzling displays of virtuosity before large audiences. But Chopin detested what he called the "flying trapeze school" of pianism.
He preferred the intimacy of salons, performing his works before audiences of royalty, bankers, artists and musicians -- the "church of Chopin," as the composer Franz Liszt called the gatherings. In these settings, fans sometimes asked for small compositions, like waltzes, as gifts.
Chopin obliged, occasionally presenting the same waltz to several people. He gave away manuscripts of the Waltz in F Minor on at least five occasions, each time to women. "Please keep it for yourself," he wrote to a recipient. "I should not like it to be made public."
The Morgan's waltz might have been written in this context. It was put down on a small sheet of paper, about 4 inches by 5 inches, of a kind commonly used for gifts. The score contains fingerings and dynamic markings, suggesting that Chopin thought the piece might be performed someday.
But Chopin, a fastidious composer -- it was not unusual for him to spend weeks on a single page -- seemed to have doubts about this waltz. He did not sign the score, as he typically would. The "Chopin" at the top of the manuscript was added by someone else, according to handwriting analysis. And there are a few uncorrected mistakes in rhythm and notation in the score.
Whatever Chopin's intentions, the waltz was never published and remained out of view, possibly in the hands of collectors.
The manuscript was acquired at some point by A. Sherrill Whiton Jr., a director of the New York School of Interior Design. Whiton, who died in 1972, was an ardent collector of autographs. He obtained much of his collection from the famed Walter R. Benjamin Autographs shop on Madison Avenue, his children said.
Whiton, an amateur pianist and composer who had studied with the renowned teachers Roger Sessions and Nadia Boulanger, had a passion for classical music. As a Navy lieutenant in the South Pacific during World War II, he brought along one book: a miniature score of Beethoven's late string quartets. He wrote three operas, finishing the final one on the day he died.
"He would play Chopin all the time," said his son Paul Whiton. "It was his escape." Whiton recalled seeing the waltz on display at the family home in Wilton, Conn., adding that the family was not aware of its importance.
Whiton's materials came to the Morgan in 2019 as a bequest from Arthur Satz, a close friend who had bought them from Whiton's wife, Jean. For five years, the collection sat uncataloged, in part because of the coronavirus pandemic.
A description accompanying the items did not offer many clues about the waltz, saying only:
CHOPIN, FRÉDÉRIC
Musical manuscript. Four systems of two staves of an unidentified piano piece, apparently in Chopin's hand, but unsigned.
The Morgan's team of experts examined the manuscript under infrared and ultraviolet light to check for damage and alterations. They determined the piece was written on machine-made wove paper with iron gall ink that dated to the 19th century. The musical style was consistent with Chopin's writings in the early 1830s. And the notation matched his famously small penmanship, as did the writing of the word "Valse" atop the score.
The researchers considered other possibilities. Had Chopin copied someone else's waltz? Could it be a pupil's work? Both seemed unlikely.
The volatile opening remains a puzzle. Kallberg, who helped authenticate the score, said the waltz's key -- A minor -- might offer a clue. Some of Chopin's most turbulent music is in that key, including the so-called "Winter Wind" étude; the Prelude No. 2; and segments of the Ballade No. 2.
"This was a key," Kallberg said, "that brought out unusual pieces for him."
Chopin wrote another stormy, dissonant waltz in 1831: the Waltz in E Minor. That piece also opens with an outburst.
The peculiarity of the Morgan's waltz is likely to inspire debate about its origins.
"There are enough highly unusual elements that you have to say, Is this really Chopin's music?" said John Rink, a music professor at the University of Cambridge who reviewed a photograph of the manuscript but was not involved in the Morgan's research.
Still, Rink said it was hard to dispute the analysis of the penmanship, paper and ink, calling it the "critical, decisive factor." He said the manuscript might reflect "Chopin's imagination in full flight, a sort of creative outburst before any ideas have been worked through."
What might Chopin make of the release of the waltz? He often covered up missteps with furious scribbles and blotches of black ink, and he told friends he wanted his unpublished works to be destroyed after his death.
Still, he might be delighted that his music was still adored, said Stephen Hough, a prominent pianist and composer. He said the waltz "may be very much a trifle, but it has a charm and preciousness."
"As long as Chopin knew that his legacy was strong and his pieces were well collected and well researched and well recorded," he added, "I can't imagine he'd be cross."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The singer and songwriter's fifth album processes intense pain through a high-concept homage to role models including Stevie Nicks, Bruce Springsteen and Britney Spears.
Pop stars start out as pop fans. Like countless other listeners, they find songs that move them, sounds they enjoy and public personas they identify with. Then, if they are talented and determined and lucky enough, they forge their own artistic identities and inspire new fans.
"The Great Impersonator," the high-concept new album from Halsey (who uses she/they pronouns), openly pays homage to her role models. On her Instagram, she specifies an influence for each song, among them Kate Bush, David Bowie, Dolly Parton, Björk and Aaliyah. She poses in photos like each one, with wigs and costumes, somewhere between Cindy Sherman and a songwriter's mood board. And in one song, "Lucky," she adapts both the title and the chorus of Britney Spears's "Lucky" to apply to her own time as a pop celebrity. "I told everybody I was fine for a whole damn year," she sings. "And that's the biggest lie of my career."
"The Great Impersonator" lets Halsey, who is 30, try on vintage styles, largely acoustic and hand-played. It's a sharp turn away from the fearsome, exploratory studio arsenal of "If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power," her 2021 album that was produced by Nine Inch Nails. The explicit concept makes a pre-emptive strike against accusations of derivativeness. Yet even as the album underlines what Halsey has learned from others, it shows what sets her apart: her insistence on channeling intense pain through her songs. In "Only Living Girl in LA," which opens the new album, Halsey sings, "I wake up every day in some new kind of suffering / I've never known a day of peace."
From the beginning -- her first EP, "Room 93," was released in 2014 -- Halsey has sung about fierce inner conflicts. On her 2015 album, "Badlands," she sang, in "Gasoline," "Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?" Her songs juggle traumas, insecurities, obsessions, self-destructive impulses, the imperatives of stardom and the inevitability of death.
Songs on "The Great Impersonator" reflect Halsey's more recent life changes: the birth in 2021 of her son, Ender Ridley Aydin -- whose voice appears in a few songs -- and her serious health problems. In June, Halsey revealed that she has been under treatment for chronic autoimmune conditions: lupus erythematosus and T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. And in September, she stated, "I made this record in the space between life and death."
Halsey's "The Great Impersonator" is full of medical encounters, recognizing the fragility and centrality of the body. "The End" -- a Joni Mitchell tribute set to fingerpicked acoustic guitar and high vocal harmonies -- sets doctor visits against the solace of love. "I Never Loved You," with stately piano chords à la Kate Bush, envisions futile surgery after a lovers' quarrel and a car crash. In "Letter to God (1983)," which hints at the ticking beat and sustained keyboard lines of Bruce Springsteen's "I'm on Fire," Halsey recalls an addicted boyfriend who had "track marks on his arms," then notes, "Now I'm the one with needles in my arms and in my legs / I'm making jokes about the blood tests and I'm planning my estate."
Halsey and her many co-producers -- including Michael Uzowuru, Alex G, Greg Kurstin and Emile Haynie -- gesture clearly toward her avowed favorites. There are burgeoning crescendos in "Ego" and in "Lonely Is the Muse," Halsey's nods to Dolores O'Riordan of the Cranberries and Amy Lee of Evanescence. "Arsonist" and "Dog Years" reflect the sullen stubbornness of Fiona Apple and PJ Harvey. "Panic Attack" harks back to the Stevie Nicks of "Rhiannon" as Halsey considers whether a romance is "a danger to my health."
For Halsey, "The Great Impersonator" is a step backward and a look inward. The borrowed styles are musical safe spaces or perhaps recovery rooms, known environments where she can take time to recuperate. Many of the songs acknowledge, if only tentatively, that love might have healing powers. In the meantime, the music that shaped her can still be a sanctuary.

Study Finds Teens Want Less Sex, More Fantasy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At least that is what they told researchers at U.C.L.A. The high popularity of romance plots in movies and shows suggests otherwise.
Movies and television shows about rich people are the last thing we want to watch. And skip the sex: We prefer content that focuses on platonic relationships. (There's enough porn online as it is.) We do like fantasy as a genre, increasingly so. But please, pretty please, fix how you incorporate social media into story lines. It's cringe.
That is what young people -- ages 10 to 24 -- think about movies, television shows, video games and social media, according to a study released Thursday.
The study, Teens & Screens, conducted by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that 63.5 percent of participants said they wanted content that depicted platonic relationships, as opposed to romance and sex. That is up from 51.5 percent last year. (Questions involving romance and sex were not shown to participants ages 10 to 13.)
Of course, what study participants say and what they actually do can vary wildly. There is ample evidence to the contrary among shows that are popular with younger audiences, including "The Sex Lives of College Girls," a raunchy comedy; "Emily in Paris," an impassioned romance; and "Tell Me Lies," a steamy soap.
Movies like "Poor Things," which found an insatiable Emma Stone romping through a Paris brothel, and the sexually frank "All of Us Strangers" attracted a surprisingly large audience of people in their early 20s, according to box office analysts.
This year's study was conducted in August and included 1,644 young people.
"We're trying to shift the culture by giving storytellers better information," said Yalda T. Uhls, the founder and chief executive of the Center for Scholars & Storytellers, which is based at U.C.L.A. "The problem is often that Hollywood storytellers use their own memories of their teenage years or what their children in Los Angeles are doing, and that does not remotely represent what young people really want."
Dr. Uhls acknowledged the possibility that participants were saying one thing while doing another, but she thinks that isn't common. "The programming currently being offered is based on what adults think they want, and if they have no other choice, teens will have to choose that," she said.
Dr. Uhls left a career in movies and television -- she worked at studios like Sony and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer -- to get her Ph.D. in developmental psychology and start the center. As part of her work, she brings groups of teenagers into entertainment companies to talk about ways to authentically represent them.
For this year's report, Dr. Uhls and her team also asked young people how they decide which movies and television shows to watch. The two most important factors were plot and ease of access. Interestingly, given the manner in which Hollywood marketers have embraced TikTok and Instagram influencers, the study's participants ranked "influencer recommendations" as one of the worst ways to persuade them to watch.
Dr. Uhls noted that 36 percent of participants ranked fantasy as their favorite genre, up from 16 percent last year.
"That tells me how badly adolescents want escape," she said. "The real world is overwhelming."

Creepy One-Man Band Extends His Performance: [Review]

Full text: Playing both Eddie Brock and the alien parasite who possesses him, Tom Hardy gives another roiling one-man-band of a performance in this third installment of the franchise.
With the 2018 film "Venom," Tom Hardy locked himself into a three-picture deal, giving his time, talents and torso to this saga about a man named Eddie Brock possessed by a fanged, body-snatching alien parasite named Venom who pops in and out of his skin like a hyper-violent prairie dog. The overly plotted "Venom: The Last Dance," written and directed by Kelly Marcel, concludes the trilogy by hammering home all that Eddie has sacrificed to merge with this impulsive, smack-talking goo blob. In the first movie, Eddie was an ambitious San Francisco investigative journalist with a fiancée played by Michelle Williams; here, he's a filthy drifter on a Mexican bender who's lost his career, his woman and his reputation. Forced to go on the lam to flee a murder accusation, Eddie makes a running joke out of the fact that he can't even hang on to a pair of shoes.
In glimpses, this is a drama about a drunk who finds himself unbearably lonely despite being conjoined with a garrulous monster. Hardy voices both reedy Eddie and gravelly Venom and his roiling one-man-band of a performance continues to be the only reason to keep up with the films. Highlights here include the herky-jerky chaos Eddie/Venom causes as he mixes a Michelada while grooving to "Tequila," and the moment when he's suctioned to the fuselage of an airplane like a Garfield plushie and sighs, "It is so unpleasantly cold." Eddie and Venom even detour to Las Vegas, the capital city of self-destruction, and dub themselves Thelma and Louise.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But these mild pleasures are overwhelmed by a barrage of underdeveloped supporting characters -- Chiwetel Ejiofor as a general, Juno Temple and Clark Backo as Area 51 scientists, a hippy family headed by Rhys Ifans -- plus a nifty spidery nasty who gobbles its victims like a scuttling wood chipper and, when sliced up, stitches its long limbs back together. There's also a barely introduced major villain named Knull (Andy Serkis, the director of 2021's "Venom: Let There Be Carnage") who seems to exist only so that the studio can bridge this finale to some other future comic book flick.
Honestly, I'd rather watch Eddie and Venom dicker over pizza toppings than team up for something as banal as saving the planet. Yet, this film prefers the latter and the bombastic battle scenes that come with it. Marcel, making her directorial debut, claws toward a strong emotional climax that's undercut by a post-credits sequence which implies that everything our heroes just endured didn't matter at all. The mechanics of the Marvel Machine must keep on cranking.
The film fills time with sequences set to Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now," David Bowie's "Space Oddity" and Abba's "Dancing Queen," plus a winkingly sentimental montage of Eddie and Venom that unspools over a Maroon 5 ballad. These spliced-together bits from all three films salute the dopey screwball comedy the franchise hit in its best moments -- and, even more so, feel like a toast to the end of Hardy's contractual agreement.

Dining Out Too Noisy? Try Earbuds.: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Booking a table for two at Tao Downtown, I hesitated when I got to the box asking whether I had a special request. I did, but I wasn't sure how it would go down. Would I be the first customer in history to ask for a noisy table?
This is not a normal ask, but I had my reasons. Recently I'd been trying to find out whether the way to hear and be heard in a dining room filled with booming speakers and screaming diners might be as simple as wearing a pair of earbuds. To put it to the test, I needed something I usually try to avoid: a hellishly loud restaurant.
As you may have heard, Apple announced last month that it would soon introduce new software enabling its AirPods Pro 2 earbuds to act as over-the-counter hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss, adjustable to your own ears. (You will be able to take a simple exam from Apple on your device, or upload the findings of one given by an audiologist.)
What you may not know is that the AirPods Pro 2 already come with a setting that can turn up the volume on the voices of people you're talking to and another one that tamps down background noise. Other earbud makers, including Sony, Samsung, Beyerdynamic and Soundcore, also offer functions meant to make conversation easier in noisy places. AirPods outsell them all, though, which is why I wore a pair to Tao and several other Manhattan restaurants known to wreak mayhem on the eardrums.
Over my 12 years as a restaurant critic, few problems I wrote about drew as many emails and comments as noise, and no issue came anywhere close to sparking as much white-hot rage. When I admitted that I like loud restaurants, up to a point, many readers were angry with me. They were even angrier with restaurants.
I get it. Long exposures to loud noise can cause hearing damage. Even at less brutal volumes, not being able to hear the other people at the table is maddening. Not being heard -- having to repeat yourself and raise your voice until you sound as if you're in a screaming match -- is worse. All this is more punishing for people with any amount of hearing loss. Drowning in an angry sea of background noise, most of us finally give in to helplessness. We seethe, silently.
Before taking my Apple-white AirPods out to dinner, I tested them in a makeshift home laboratory. I sat in a chair with bookshelf speakers on either side of my head loudly blaring "Metal Machine Music," Lou Reed's room-clearing experiment in crunching guitar dissonance. Several feet in front of my face I set a third speaker, tuned to "The Brian Lehrer Show" on WNYC, on which a botanist was being interviewed about fall foliage.
In the first round, with my naked ears, Lou totally annihilated Brian. For the next round, I stuffed the AirPods into my ears set to what Apple calls Transparency Mode. The point of Transparency Mode is to allow the ambient noise in, and boy, did it ever. 2-0, Lou.
Then came the real experiment. Still in Transparency Mode, I burrowed down into the Accessibility settings until I had toggled the Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction switches to their lime-green On positions. Conversation Boost uses directional microphones to isolate and amplify voices that are directly in front of the listener. Ambient Noise Reduction dampens sound coming from other angles.
Now the botanist came through loud and clear. Lou's guitars purred raggedly but semi-quietly, like an asthmatic house cat.
In the wild, my earbuds' performance was less dramatic.
Inside two restaurants on the stretch of the Lower East Side that some people call Dimes Square, I ran into a problem I hadn't expected: The dining rooms weren't very loud. This is not the usual complaint about Dimes Square, but it was a warm night, and more people were eating outside than in.
Both restaurants had also thrown open their windows. This meant that sound waves, instead of bouncing off the glass to bombard the ears of everybody indoors, went sailing out of the room like paper planes.
Even though the din wasn't as murderous as I'd hoped, it did lead to a discovery I hadn't expected. I went with a friend who also owns an AirPods Pro 2 set. Each time he plugged them into his ears and turned down the background noise, he dropped his voice to a murmur, as if he were in a genuinely quiet room. Nice for him, but I could barely hear a word he said -- even with the help of my own AirPods.
Tao Downtown has no windows or outdoor seating. As our host took a right at a reclining Buddha the length of a moving van and led us down the 40-foot staircase to the sunken dining room, I saw full tables everywhere. The music was thumping along. It wasn't hellishly noisy, but it would do.
My AirPods didn't make the thumping disappear. They helped a lot, though. It was as if I'd dialed the volume down to three from seven or eight. My dinner guest across the table came through clearly. I could hear him without my AirPods, too, but I had to work at it -- leaning forward, watching his lips and making other small efforts that can add up to make a night in a noisy space exhausting.
That I could hear him at all was no doubt the result of painstaking planning by Tao's designers. Building a restaurant where you can talk to your dinner companions is a tricky proposition. Background noise can come from street traffic, subway tracks, air-conditioning, exhaust hoods and subwoofers. The No. 1 enemy of conversation, though, is simply other people.
"Your biggest source you have to control is the human voice," said Albert Maniscalco, a partner at Cerami & Associates who has helped massage the acoustics of Union Square Cafe and Eataly.
The voices you want to hear are in the same frequency range as the ones you don't, Mr. Maniscalco explained, so there's constant competition for your ears. This crowding is especially critical in the higher frequencies produced by consonants, those quick bursts of sound that make the difference between, say, "Spain" and "stain." Your friend's voice may carry across the table, but crucial bits of information that make her intelligible will be missing, especially as higher frequencies build up around you.
And build they will. People who want to be heard over background chatter will, invariably and often subconsciously, start to vocalize more and more forcefully. This tendency is so well documented that it has a name, the Lombard effect, and it is not unique to humans. It has been studied in cats, canaries, marmosets, bats, frogs and beluga whales.
Braxton Boren, an associate professor of audio technology at American University, has described the Lombard effect in crowded rooms as a version of what social scientists call the tragedy of the commons, the tendency of people to overuse a shared, finite resource until they spoil it.
In Mr. Boren's analogy, the resource is peace and quiet. Diners in a crowded restaurant probably know that they have a shared interest in keeping the volume down to a conversation-friendly level. But they also want to be heard, even when it means talking too loudly. Self-interest wins out over the common good.
"Every person who gets a little louder is a betrayal of our common pact to stay quiet," Mr. Boren said.
The two standard ways to prevent the tragedy are regulation and privatization. We might all agree to speak more quietly in restaurants -- a form of social regulation. "But the mechanics of the Lombard effect make it very unlikely that a group of people will do this for any length of time," he said.
The other answer is to privatize parts of the commons. In a restaurant, Mr. Boren said, this could mean installing booths with partitions that block some of the noise coming from the big, shouty table in the center of the room. But he is also intrigued by hearing aids and earbuds with directional microphones. In effect, they allow the wearer to stake out a personal quiet zone inside a loud space.
A couple on a date with tiny speakers plugged into their ears may strike us as unromantic, but it shouldn't if it helps them talk to each other. Diners have different hearing abilities and different ideas of a good time. My signal may be your noise, and vice versa. The restaurant that can please all sets of ears does not exist.
So why aren't more people tweaking the volume of crowded rooms to their own preference? In the case of AirPods, one answer may be that Conversation Boost and Ambient Noise Reduction are so well buried in the settings that each time I wanted to switch them on, it was like crawling through a heating duct in the ceiling.
Both functions are nested inside the Accessibility settings, where people who don't believe they have hearing loss aren't likely to look. They should become easier to find when the hearing-aid and hearing-test functions are rolled out in the coming weeks.
Based on my experiments, I would not suggest buying a pair of AirPods Pro 2 just for these features. But if you already own them or one of the other earbuds that have similar settings, I would recommend taking them out for dinner. Even a modest improvement could make the difference between real communication and silent rage. And it's cheaper than a trip to Stain.

NEW YORK — Booking a table for two at Tao Downtown, I hesitated when I got to the box asking whether I had a special request. I did, but I wasn’t sure how it would go down. Would I be the first customer in history to ask for a noisy table?
This is not a normal ask, but I had my reasons. Recently I’d been trying to find out whether the way to hear and be heard in a dining room filled with booming speakers and screaming diners might be as simple as wearing a pair of earbuds. To put it to the test, I needed something I usually try to avoid: a hellishly loud restaurant.
As you may have heard, Apple announced last month that it would soon introduce new software enabling its AirPods Pro 2 earbuds to act as over-the-counter hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss, adjustable to your own ears. (You will be able to take a simple exam from Apple on your device, or upload the findings of one given by an audiologist.)
What you may not know is that the AirPods Pro 2 already come with a setting that can turn up the volume on the voices of people you’re talking to and another one that tamps down background noise. Other earbud makers, including Sony, Samsung, Beyerdynamic and Soundcore, also offer functions meant to make conversation easier in noisy places. AirPods outsell them all, though, which is why I wore a pair to Tao and several other Manhattan restaurants known to wreak mayhem on the eardrums.
Over my 12 years as a restaurant critic, few problems I wrote about drew as many emails and comments as noise, and no issue came anywhere close to sparking as much white-hot rage. When I admitted that I like loud restaurants, up to a point, many readers were angry with me. They were even angrier with restaurants.
I get it. Long exposures to loud noise can cause hearing damage. Even at less brutal volumes, not being able to hear the other people at the table is maddening. Not being heard — having to repeat yourself and raise your voice until you sound as if you’re in a screaming match — is worse. All this is more punishing for people with any amount of hearing loss. Drowning in an angry sea of background noise, most of us finally give in to helplessness. We seethe, silently.
Before taking my Apple-white AirPods out to dinner, I tested them in a makeshift home laboratory. I sat in a chair with bookshelf speakers on either side of my head loudly blaring “Metal Machine Music,” Lou Reed’s room-clearing experiment in crunching guitar dissonance. Several feet in front of my face I set a third speaker, tuned to “The Brian Lehrer Show” on WNYC, on which a botanist was being interviewed about fall foliage.
In the first round, with my naked ears, Lou totally annihilated Brian. For the next round, I stuffed the AirPods into my ears set to what Apple calls Transparency Mode. The point of Transparency Mode is to allow the ambient noise in, and boy, did it ever. 2-0, Lou.

Conversation Boost uses directional microphones to isolate and amplify voices that are directly in front of the listener. Ambient Noise Reduction dampens sound coming from other angles.

A Ravishing Color Palette for a Silent Adventure: [Review]

Full text: The visual influences of Neva, by the studio that made Gris, include the film "Princess Mononoke."
Anyone who has seen "Princess Mononoke," Hayao Miyazaki's 1997 masterpiece about a young warrior and her wolf who battle to stave off an ecological disaster, will almost certainly discern its influence on the video game Neva. Both open against the backdrop of a once pristine natural environment that has been overrun with a dark, squirming substance capable of infecting and turning animals into maniacally focused killers.
Neva parades its Studio Ghibli influence to the point where the word "homage" becomes strained, but its visual presentation, mechanics and level design lift a fairly typical adventure title into something thoroughly satisfying to play.
Like Gris (2018), the first game by the Spanish developer Nomada Studio, Neva is particularly notable for its ravishing use of monochromatic colors. Running through a green field near the start of the game, I was entranced by how the foreground called to mind the simplicity of late 20th-century computer graphics, while the more detailed mountainous landscape in the background hewed to a level of detail that one would expect in a modern game. The harmonious marriage of simplicity and lush details gives Neva a powerful aesthetic punch.
The game begins in medias res with a woman, a wolflike creature with antlers that is blinded in one eye and a cub; the trio comes upon a recently deceased bird that has been transformed into a somber flower. Soon after, a dark mass appears from which thin-limbed beings emerge.
The woman falls to the ground and eventually loses consciousness while the elder wolf struggles valiantly to fend off the tide. When the woman wakes, she finds no sign of the menacing threat but discovers the giant wolf lying nearby, unresponsive. The cub nudges up against her, and the two find consolation in each other's presence.
Neva then cuts to a summery landscape where the woman and a young cub are relaxing in a glade. The woman stirs and calls the cub from its slumber. "Neva," she says.
It's the only word players will hear uttered for the duration of their journey.
The game's creative director, Conrad Roset, said the woman's name is Alba, based on a character in the science fiction novel "Mecanoscrito del Segundo Origen" ("Typescript of the Second Origin"). Early in its development process, Roset noted in an email, Neva was "about two children who meet but speak different languages, exploring that relationship and addressing themes like communication."
Not long after the game cedes control of Alba to the player, who with the press of a button can call Neva to her side, the characters encounter a blighted tree. Its top half breaks off and is suspended in the air. Passing that, they're confronted with hazardous shoots that spring out of the ground, which can be felled with a swing of Alba's sword.
Neva does an excellent job easing players into its systems. At first, I found the combat fairly rudimentary as new enemy types -- fat-bodied, thin-limbed, shadowy creatures or possessed animals -- are introduced. But then players are confronted with them in greater numbers and different combinations. Eventually, you must raise and lower platforms while fending off enemies scampering from one elevation to another.
The game's platforming challenges also gradually scale. An early scenario requires one to double jump and dodge in the air to avoid environmental obstacles and enemy blows. Late in the game, players must cross a mirrored landscape in which platforms are invisible on one side and visible on the other. It requires looking at the side with your reflection and reversing joystick inputs -- pressing back to move forward and vice versa. It hurt my brain in a fabulous way.
Roset, the creative director, said the game's visual influences included the sculptor David Umemoto, whose "geometry inspires my architectural designs"; the work of the artist Zdzislaw Beksinski, whose work served as a touchstone for the game's enemy designs; and "the landscapes of the illustrator Pascal Campion." The overall visual approach, he said, is "drawing without outlines, without lines, relying solely on shapes."
It's extraordinarily effective. Neva is top-drawer eye candy by a developer whose flair for visual language stands among the best in the industry.
Neva was reviewed on the PlayStation 5. It is also available on the PC, PlayStation 4, Switch and Xbox Series X|S.

Full text: 'Aftersun' (2022)
Charlotte Wells writes and directs this stunning memory play, which begins as a wandering account of a divorced father (Paul Mescal) and his 11-year-old daughter (Frankie Corio), on holiday for his birthday. Wells expertly deploys brief but affecting flash-forwards to snap the story into focus. The film is anchored by Mescal (deservedly Oscar-nominated) and Corio (who turns in one of the best performances by a young actor in recent memory).
'His Three Daughters' (2024)
Carrie Coon, Natasha Lyonne and Elizabeth Olsen are great in this comedy-drama from the writer-director Azazel Jacobs. They play the title characters, who have assembled in the apartment where their father (Jay O. Sanders) is dying; their simmering conflicts and resentments boil over as they wait for his last breaths. Jacobs masterfully intermingles laughs and pathos.
'Psycho' (1960)
Alfred Hitchcock revolutionized the horror movie with this wildly influential (and still plenty scary) hit. The master filmmaker upended expectations by making a stripped-down black-and-white chiller on a B-movie budget. He cast mostly lesser-known actors, save for Janet Leigh, then shocked audiences by killing her off at the end of the first act. That murder in a hotel shower would become one of the most iconic sequences in cinema history.
'The Teachers' Lounge' (2023)
Leonie Benesch (above) stars as Carla Nowak, a new sixth-grade teacher who finds out how fragile her sense of trust and idealism are in this harrowing drama from the director Ilker Catak. An atmosphere of suspicion and paranoia pervades a German school, thanks to a series of petty thefts. Catak expertly builds operatic tension and discomfort out of everyday stress.
'Will & Harper' (2024)
In 2021, Harper Steele, a former head writer of "Saturday Night Live," sent an email to her longtime friend and collaborator Will Ferrell to reintroduce herself as a transgender woman. Ferrell wanted to support his friend and also had some questions, so the two went on a cross-country trip. Directed by Josh Greenbaum, "Will & Harper" is a blend of comedy road movie and snapshot of a warm, durable friendship. JASON BAILEY

Full text: A remake of the 2001 survival horror game sands down the unwieldy combat that made it a powerful, disturbing classic.
The survival horror masterpiece Silent Hill 2 features some of the most ungainly combat ever included in a video game. You play as James Sunderland, a grieving widower who has received a letter that purports to have been written by his wife. You must make your way through a mysterious fog-enshrouded town while fending off the monsters that inhabit it, and you are barely up to the task.
Your primary means of self-defense are a length of steel pipe and a flimsy wooden plank, both of which are awkward to wield. Winding up to swing takes an unreasonably long time. If you connect, you're left defenseless while taking a moment to recover.
When you eventually find a gun, you have little ammunition, and aiming is so delicate that you almost always miss. There's not even much incentive to fight: Vanquished foes don't drop items or power-ups, and defeating them doesn't earn you experience points. Faced with an enemy in the 2001 game, it's nearly always better just to run away.
In its remake of Silent Hill 2 that was released for the PlayStation 5 and PC this week, the Polish developer Bloober Team has pointedly addressed this clumsiness.
A glowing review in IGN explains that the remake "smoothly polishes down the rough edges of the original game's combat" by integrating an over-the-shoulder targeting system and dodge and parry movements that allow James "to nimbly sidestep around lurching enemies or the streams of acidic bile they spew." In keeping with other modern horror games, the new Silent Hill 2 makes players feel quick, agile and powerful.
But this is not an improvement. In fact, it's a betrayal of the original game and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of what made it so compelling.
Silent Hill 2's combat was clumsy and unwieldy by design: It put you in the shoes not of an invulnerable video game superhero, but of an ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances, as ill-equipped to battle monsters as any one of us would be. It helped cultivate an atmosphere of oppressive, excruciating dread, in which every passing encounter with an enemy could be fatal.
Silent Hill 2 is a sequel not by story but by setting. The first Silent Hill, released for the Sony PlayStation in 1999, was about a man searching for his missing daughter, and it revolved around a demonic cult and telekinetic powers. Silent Hill 2, set in the same small town in Maine, tells the stand-alone story of the Sunderlands, a simple but emotionally complex tale about grief and shame.
"In my restless dreams, I see that town," begins the letter that James receives at the outset of the game. "I'm alone there now, in our special place, waiting for you." The uncanny tone is the first clue that there's more going on here than a missing wife. It quickly becomes clear that all is not as it seems within Silent Hill, and indeed that all is not well with James Sunderland. The town appears abandoned but he soon finds other visitors, each of whom acts strangely and largely undisturbed by the roaming monsters.
James meets a woman, Maria, who looks a lot like his wife -- shades of "Vertigo" -- and then she, too, dies, before turning up unharmed in another location, insisting that she was never even in danger. All of these encounters combine to create an air of unease. The somewhat stilted dialogue adds to the feeling that something is "off" -- it's not merely scary, but disturbing.
Everything in Silent Hill 2 is unpleasant. Sometimes, as in the films of David Lynch and the paintings of Francis Bacon -- two presiding influences -- the unpleasantness manifests as eerily beautiful, as in the town's fathomless banks of purgatorial fog or the huge inferno that engulfs a seaside hotel. Other times it can be more brutal.
One of the game's most famous boss battles is against an enemy known as "Abstract Daddy." Drawn from the subconscious of Angela, a young woman traumatized by her childhood sexual abuse, he appears as a deformed, vaguely phallic creature trapped within the frame of a bed. It sounds trite to call monsters like these "inner demons." But the subconscious basis of the horror gives Silent Hill 2 a rare emotional depth.
There's one moment in particular that has stuck with me since I first played the Konami-published game on the PlayStation 2 more than 20 years ago.
James has entered the town's historical society, a large house that has been converted into a museum. Part of the wall in one room has been knocked down, revealing a dark, narrow staircase lined on either side by coarse, heavy rock. You begin to walk down the stairs -- and they don't stop. You just keep walking, further and further down, for what feels like an eternity, tracing a seemingly endless arc like one of the "impossible" hallways in Mark Z. Danielewski's "House of Leaves."
The moment is inspired in part by the scene in "Jacob's Ladder" in which an infinite procession of hospital hallways resembles a harrowing descent into hell. Like that sequence, the historical society staircase renders a psychological -- or perhaps spiritual -- journey in physical space, making literal a primal, universal kind of fear.
Part of the brilliance of Silent Hill 2 is that it allows itself to linger on these moments of nonaction, of stretching out time without dialogue or story to focus on atmosphere and emotion. Its impact derives from its emphasis on these qualities rather than shootouts and chase scenes. The gameplay serves its ideas rather than the other way around.
When the original Silent Hill 2 was released, reviews criticized the clunky combat. But as Janet Malcolm once wrote of J.D. Salinger's work, "negative contemporary criticism of a masterpiece can be helpful to later critics," as "the 'mistakes' and 'excesses' that early critics complain of are often precisely the innovations that have given the work its power."
It's hard to think of a better example of this phenomenon in video games than Silent Hill 2. It's clear now, or should be, that the game's deliberately clunky action is one of its most significant achievements, a bold creative choice that dovetailed perfectly with the themes of the story.
Which is why the changes made by the remake are all the more disappointing. Perhaps Silent Hill 2 is now smoother and more modern. But in its imperfections, the original was genius.

An Actress Who Can Do It All: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "I wish I could live through something," says the teenage title character in the 2017 movie "Lady Bird," yearning for a life beyond suburban Sacramento.
The actor playing her, Saoirse Ronan, had, at that point, already lived through enough for several lives. Then 23, she'd been acting since she was 9, and had already garnered two Oscar nominations. "Lady Bird," Greta Gerwig's debut as a solo director, would earn Ronan a third. Another followed, in 2019, for her role as Jo March in Gerwig's "Little Women."
This year, Oscars buzz surrounds Ronan once again, thanks to her leading roles in Nora Fingscheidt's "The Outrun," which opens in theaters Friday, and Steve McQueen's "Blitz," out Nov. 1st.
Ronan's career reads as a series of evolutions, pushing into new territory with every role -- over the years, she has also played a 1950s Irish immigrant in New York, a child assassin, a vampire, Lady Macbeth and Mary, Queen of Scots. Now 30, with over two decades of experience in front of the camera, the Irish actress has committed herself in "The Outrun" to a character containing multitudes: a woman raised in a remote island community, who returns to recover from her addiction to alcohol.
"It was so much more than just making a film for me," Ronan said, in a video interview from New York. She described an experience that was both physically and emotionally demanding: "I think actors are sponges, you're able to open yourself up to everything around you." For "The Outrun," that meant swimming in the icy sea, delivering lambs on-camera and going deep into the psyche of a woman in crisis.
The movie unfolds on Orkney, an island off Scotland's northern coast, and the "outrun" is a wind-wracked stretch of land where farmland gives way to the sea. It's a terrain of extreme beauty, of sandstone cliffs and open sky, sea-green and cerulean, matched by the blue hair of Ronan's character Rona, who returns home to the island to recover from her addiction.
Here, nature has the power to heal, not by curing Rona of her own wildness but by inspiring her to accept it. We watch as Rona walks slowly into the cold waves, is visited by a colony of bobbing seals, and spends her nights listening for the call of the corncrake, a rare bird that nests on the island.
Her recovery is spliced with scenes from her former life in London -- first ecstatic, then catastrophic -- where drinking destroyed her relationship and her career as a scientist. Ronan said that exploring the psychology of alcohol addiction was her "main motivation" in taking on this role. "It's in the makeup of our culture in Ireland and the U.K., and I have been affected by it in the way that so many other people have," she said. "It unfortunately -- but maybe also fortunately -- shaped me and influenced me a lot growing up."
Speaking carefully to avoid identifying the person in question, Ronan spoke about her experience watching an alcoholic up close. "I repressed a lot of the feelings I had towards it," she said, adding that she now felt ready "to really crack it open and explore the psychology of an addict."
The director Fingscheidt's first film, "System Crasher," follows a 9-year-old girl whose violent outbursts send her on an odyssey through the foster system. Rona in "The Outrun" is a kind of spiritual successor: a woman capable of wonder as well as emotional extremes. "It's the full spectrum, from absolute euphoria, to love, to devastation, and depression, and shame," Fingscheidt said. "She goes through almost every possible human shade of emotion."
Fingscheidt co-wrote the screenplay with Amy Liptrot, the author of the 2015 addiction-recovery memoir that the movie is based on. Early in the movie's development, Fingscheidt and Liptrot met with Ronan, and the three decided to rename the protagonist "Rona" instead of "Amy," after another Scottish island that is uninhabited and a lot more remote. "We picked 'Rona', because it's an island beyond the outrun," Fingscheidt said, "but also there's a similarity to 'Ronan."'
Several of the movie's scenes were shot on the farm where Liptrot grew up, and though Ronan's character was drawn from her memoir, it was never intended as a direct portrayal, Liptrot said. "She has that brittleness that I had in early sobriety," Liptrot said, "and then towards the end, she channels the ambition of my writing -- that sort of manic, grandiose quality."
When shooting wrapped in the wilds of Orkney, Ronan headed south to London, to shoot "Blitz." In that movie, she plays Rita, a mother searching for her missing 9-year-old son as the city is bombed by the Nazis during World War II.
Rita embodies a woman both challenged and liberated by the absence of men, who have left for the front lines. With her hair tied in a scarf, like Rosie the Riveter, and her legs marked with eyeliner, to look like she's wearing seamed stockings, we see Rita singing, dancing, working in a munitions factory and agitating with other working-class Londoners for the opening of bomb shelters.
"In that time, women were the backbone of the country, emotionally and physically," McQueen said in a recent interview. "I wanted to give that character -- a sort of unsung hero -- a platform." McQueen said he admired Ronan's ability to move between registers. "It's a very intimate film, but at the same time the scale is epic," he said. "She has the ability to hold those two fields, in a way not a lot of actresses can."
McQueen was also impressed by Ronan's singing, which was key to the role. In one uncertain, then triumphant, scene, we watch Rita perform a song on BBC radio from the factory where she works. McQueen remembered shooting the scene in Liverpool: "There were 450 women," he said. "Usually men dominate a set, but the energy was completely different. Saoirse sang to them, and there was this infectious sense of emotion."
Rita also sings with her son, George, played by Elliott Heffernan, and her father, Gerald, played by the musician Paul Weller, both of whom were acting for the first time. "It was like a family unit," McQueen said. "With Saoirse, she was not only protective of Elliott, but she understood him, because of course she started to act when she was nine herself."
Clips of Ronan's earliest on-camera performances are still available on YouTube: In 2003, she appeared in "The Clinic," a medical drama made by Ireland's public broadcaster, as an earnest child who narrowly escapes getting run over by a car. Behind the wheel on-set was her father, Paul, also an actor.
Paul and his wife Monica were living in New York as undocumented immigrants when Ronan was born. Her mother worked as a cleaner, and Paul worked as a bartender and a builder while auditioning for acting gigs. The family returned to Dublin when Ronan was three, then moved to Carlow, Ireland's second-smallest county, and Paul was cast in the Irish soap operas "Ballykissangel" and "Fair City."
Ronan grew up visiting her father on film sets, and made rapid progress once she started landing her own roles. Not long after "The Clinic," she was cast as Briony in "Atonement," a 2007 adaptation of the Ian McEwan novel, a role that earned her nominations for a BAFTA, a Golden Globe and an Oscar.
Although she was just 13 at the time, Ronan held her own next to Keira Knightley and James McAvoy in the movie. She shone amid an ensemble cast in Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), and in "Brooklyn" (2015), her first leading adult role. More recently, Ronan's collaborations with Gerwig, in "Lady Bird" and "Little Women," showcased the same charm that helped her 2017 appearance hosting "Saturday Night Live" go viral.
That monologue, which included a song about how to pronounce "Saoirse" (it's SAYR-sha), was as much a conversation about Irishness as it was a joke about the nation's love of names with superfluous vowels. It also spoke to Ronan's other role as a cultural ambassador and part of a wave of young Irish actors that includes Paul Mescal, Barry Keoghan and Jessie Buckley, currently making a global impact.
McQueen -- who has previously given prominent roles in his movies to Irish actors, including Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell and Michael Fassbender -- praised an outlook that all three, and Ronan, have in common. "It's an island," he said of Ireland. "No one can get too big for their boots. I also think that when you come from an island, there's a real want there to communicate, and tell stories, and to find the emotion."
Ronan, who recently bought a house in West Cork, said she remained attached to her home country, even as she moves far beyond it. "What I'm most grateful for about Ireland is the fact that we celebrate the arts as much as we do," said Ronan, adding: "We're not embarrassed when it comes to emotion, and feeling, and storytelling. We thrive on that."

Cassettes Are Back. Now Find a Tape Deck.: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Musicians and fans have developed a new taste for an old format, but manufacturers largely stopped making players. Listeners are finding creative (and vintage) solutions.
When Taylor Swift released "1989 (Taylor's Version)" in an array of physical formats last year, Cora Buel knew she had to get the cassette right away. Buel, a 48-year-old based in Daly City, Calif., is a fan of Swift's music -- an affinity she shares with her teenage daughter, who has since bought her mother more tapes as gifts. One main reason? Buel drives a 1998 BMW Z3, and has no other convenient options for on-the-road album playback.
"Just get an old car that only plays cassettes," Buel said, "and you'll listen every day."
Although Buel might be an extreme proponent of retro design -- she works as chief revenue officer at ThredUp, an online consignment store -- the cassette's return is by now almost as unmistakable as the format's distinctive hiss and warble.
Dominant in the United States from the early 1980s until it was overtaken commercially by the compact disc in the early 1990s, the cassette tape has survived as an underground phenomenon, a deliberately anachronistic medium of choice for artists on the noise, avant-garde and low-fi fringes. But tapes began turning up at the trend-chasing retailer Urban Outfitters as long ago as 2015, the same year that digital streaming first overtook download sales. Nearly a decade later, Swift's latest album, "The Tortured Poets Department," stands as the top-selling cassette of the year so far, with about 23,000 copies sold through June 30, according to the tracking service Luminate.
Sure, cassette sales of Swift's new album pale beside its performance in even other physical formats, where it boasts sales of 1.1 million copies on CD and another 988,000 on vinyl. But "Tortured Poets" alone is on pace to beat the total annual sales of all albums on cassette for as recently as 2009, when the Luminate precursor Nielsen SoundScan reported a mere 34,000 units shipped. If Spotify killed the iTunes star, and vinyl is increasingly a high-priced luxury item -- never mind CDs for the moment -- then cassettes could be the cockroaches that outlive them all.
As labels look to capitalize on "superfans" who will buy multiple formats, artists releasing new music on cassette this year cross genres and generations. A sampling of musicians embracing the format includes: the pop polymath Charli XCX, the alternative-rock titan Kim Deal, the adventurous South Florida rapper Denzel Curry, the outré Thom Yorke band the Smile, the black-metal group Darkthrone, the pop-rock duo Twenty One Pilots, the meditative electronic producer Tycho, the masked country singer Orville Peck, the folk-pop troubadour Shawn Mendes, the reigning pop wunderkind Billie Eilish, the garage-rocker Ty Segall, the alt-pop eclecticist Remi Wolf and the sultry singer-songwriter Omar Apollo.
Though the last new car to be factory-equipped with a cassette deck was reportedly a 2010 Lexus, more than a quarter of light-duty vehicles on the road are at least 15 years old, according to a recent analysis by S&P Global Mobility. Susanna Thomson of the Oakland, Calif., band Sour Widows still listens to cassettes in her 1998 Volvo wagon, which has a tape deck and a CD player. "I-90," a song on the alternative-rock group's bittersweet new album, "Revival of a Friend," includes lyrics about driving down the interstate while singing along repeatedly to a beloved cassette; the tape in question was by the Southern California punk-rock outfit Joyce Manor.
"I have a little cassette library in my car that just stays there, and I'll rotate tapes out," she said.
At 29, Thomson presumably grew up after the cassette's heyday, but she said that listening to tapes was partly grounded in nostalgia for her. There's an element of protest, too. "Being passionate about cassettes, vinyl, CDs," Thomson said, can be "an act of resistance against the powers-that-be that have their horrible fingers in the world of art." While Thomson also has a Sony Walkman-style portable cassette player, it has a broken part, she said, and she doesn't know how to fix it.
To cassette listeners without access to automobiles of a certain age (and their tape decks), Thomson's tale of a busted Walkman might have a familiar ring. The best-known audio equipment manufacturers of the cassette era have long since exited the market.
Sony sold more than 200 million Walkmans from July 1979, when the devices debuted in Japan, until the music stopped around 2010. Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba and Bose no longer sell audio tape players, representatives for each of the four companies confirmed. The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group, stopped tracking sales of combination radio/cassette/CD players in 2016, when there were an estimated 653,671 units shipped, compared with a likely peak of around 25 million radio/cassette combos in 1994, according to a spokesperson.
Although the market for new cassette players became too small to bother measuring, a vast supply of the ostensibly obsolete gadgets was already in existence, in various states of repair, waiting to be rediscovered.
Liam Dwyer, the 20-year-old general director of WXBC, the student-run radio station at Bard College, originally got into tapes because an older Volkswagen that belonged to Dwyer's father had a cassette deck in it. While there's a tape deck at the station, Dwyer (who uses they/them pronouns) recently found a cassette player at school that someone was giving away -- a Technics, model unknown. "I haven't tested it yet, but I believe that it will work, or I will fix it up," they said.
Dwyer has been looking into acquiring a Walkman for portable use, partly because of an interest in how artists like Liz Harris, a.k.a. Grouper, incorporate tapes into sound art and instrumental music. The first tapes Dwyer picked up were by Golden Boy, a "breakcore" artist from their own hometown, Portland, Ore., and the music that Dwyer listens to on cassette is mainly electronic and experimental. A double cassette from the Frank Ocean associate Vegyn was a staple in the Volkswagen, but "the car, unfortunately, had to be towed."
If cassettes are popular, it's in part because they are cheap for do-it-yourself artists and independent labels to get made. For one recent title on Jack White's Third Man Records, cassettes cost $ 2.80 apiece to produce versus $ 6.92 per vinyl LP, Ben Blackwell, one of the label's founders, said. Tape enthusiasts' preferences in playback devices can be similarly economical.
Indeed, the main reason people buy used physical media, including cassettes, is to "get a bunch of stuff for a low price and then engage with it," said Mike Hunchback, a co-owner of Brooklyn Record Exchange. He noted that his customers tend to seek out used cassette players at thrift shops, at record stores like his or online. "The majority of people that are listening to cassettes now that I sell to, they are using a cassette player that is at least 20 years old," Hunchback said. "And the function of that cassette player is to listen to cassettes for fun."
He emphasized that enjoying old music need not require large amounts of disposable wealth, and he contended that "the overwhelming majority" of working cassette players from 25 years ago -- including unopened devices that purportedly can still be found collecting dust behind the counters of the city's delis and bodegas -- will meet listeners' needs. "The joy of it is to actually listen to it," he stressed.
That said, some who listen to vintage cassettes may also understandably have an appreciation for vintage audio gear. Johannes Stoeber, the general manager at Rutgers University's student-run radio station, WRSU, collects audio equipment, mainly for analog forms of playback, and he listens to cassettes on a recorder and playback machine from Nakamichi, a high-end Japanese company. A former musician in a symphony orchestra, Stoeber, 20, tries to emulate that experience of being "enveloped by the music" in his home listening. "I listen to cassettes and other physical forms of media mostly as a way to have more of an interaction with the music," he said.
Stoeber favors reel-to-reel or vinyl for classical music listening, but argues that rock from the 1960s and '70s goes well on cassette, and so does pop. While he's drawn to the tactile nature of working with tapes, as well as their versatility, Stoeber also contended that cassettes, including high-performing Type 2 and Type 4 tapes, can have a sonic character that's preferable to other formats, analogue media types among them. "Digital music is flat," Stoeber said. "Often vinyl can feel that way too, because it doesn't have the occasional bit of wow and flutter that introduces a little life into it."
Some new manufacturers have entered the cassette market, meeting a simmering demand but confronting a vastly different supply-side landscape than in the 1990s. FiiO, an electronics company with headquarters in Guangzhou, China, recently debuted a bare-bones, Walkman-style cassette player that sells for about $ 100. "The biggest challenge has been the near-complete disruption of the cassette player supply chain," the company's chief executive, James Chung, said in an emailed statement. "Restoring the technical prowess of 1990s Walkman devices is virtually impossible today." Then again, vinyl record production has largely overcome a similar supply squeeze in the past decade.
A Paris-based startup called We Are Rewind introduced its own minimalist, Walkman-like tape player via Kickstarter in 2020, citing inspiration from the timeworn cassette deck at the heart of the "Guardians of the Galaxy" film franchise, as well as from the 1980s-retro Netflix smash series "Stranger Things." Retailing for about $ 160 and up, We Are Rewind's portable tape machines also offer Bluetooth connectivity for wireless listening.
While the company's chief executive, Romain Boudruche, acknowledged an initial struggle to find suppliers, he said We Are Rewind sold almost 20,000 cassette players last year and hopes to double that number in 2024. He outlined plans for a smaller version and a boombox, plus collaborations with artists and brands. "The possibilities are really big, even if it's a still a niche," Boudruche said.
The North Carolina rapper Rapsody, who made her cassette debut earlier this year with a limited-edition tape of her new album, "Please Don't Cry," grew up listening to the format, but she first encountered its rebirth a couple of years ago: Her fellow Kendrick Lamar collaborator, Ab-Soul, sent her a package with a cassette of his 2022 album "Herbert" and, as it happens, a We Are Rewind player. Although Rapsody's tape has sold out twice, she was surprised at first to find out that her fans were listening to it. "I thought it was a collector's item," she explained. "But people really want the experience."
That's not to say that all cassettes sold these days are actually being played. "As with vinyl, most aren't really worried about that," Carl Mello, brand engagement director for Newbury Comics, wrote in an email. Mello noted, however, that Newbury Comics, a music and collectibles chain based in the Northeast, has been selling 30 units a month of a "cheapy" Walkman-style portable tape player by Jensen, "more than we sell of any individual turntable model."
The Haitian American rapper Mach-Hommy offers a nuanced perspective on cassettes. He has released oodles of them -- including this year's "Richaxxhaitian" -- and some of his tapes are listed for thousands of dollars on the resale website Discogs (which, by the way, has about 87,000 active listenings for cassettes released since 2020). But he is also a longtime listener, with his own hand-me-down dual-well cassette deck and vivid memories of perhaps ill-advisedly taping over one of his father's cassettes as a child. He has a Walkman, he said, but he doesn't use it much.
While Mach-Hommy said he's flattered by the resale values, he expressed ambivalence about what people do with the music on his tapes, whether that's push play or try to flip for profit. "I made it to listen to," he said. "But I've heard accounts of people being able to take some of these pieces, resell them, and open a business or buy a car, or steer themselves out of homelessness and destitution." In the end, he added, "it's up to you."

A Journey From Rock Bottom to Recovery: [Review]

Full text: Saoirse Ronan gives another stunning performance in a story about an alcoholic in search of healing.
Saoirse Ronan has made it apparent that she is one of the greatest actresses of her generation. Nominated for four Oscars before she was out of her mid-20s, the Irish actress is the sort of performer whose presence in a movie is sufficient reason to see it. She chooses her projects carefully, often movies about complex women, and throws her whole self into them, with unforgettable results.
But how she does what she does is harder to pin down. Ronan does not rely on showy exaggeration or wild swings for her craft. Her most acclaimed roles -- in "Atonement," "Brooklyn," "Lady Bird" and "Little Women" -- all feel, at least from the outside, as if they tap into some part of her real self. All four are intelligent and perceptive and plucky and just a little innocent, in need of some hard-knock wisdom. Yet they're all indelible, and all very different from one another: girls and women for whom life is a good, hard mystery to be lived and then understood.

I think Ronan's great ability lies in giving us the sense that her characters' minds are always working, something that can only really be communicated through the eyes and nearly imperceptible facial expressions, flashes of anger and happiness and passion and pain. (And a lot of impishness; cheeky Ronan is always a delight.)
One might reasonably have expected "The Outrun," in which Ronan plays a recovering addict desperately hanging onto sobriety, to be a more conventionally brash or hyperbolic role than usual, the kind designed for awards attention. Woman out of control, woman on the road to healing -- you know the type. But Ronan is no ordinary actress, and she makes "The Outrun," which occasionally veers near overdone territory, into a thing of beauty and hard-won joy.
The director Nora Fingscheidt wrote the screenplay for "The Outrun" with Amy Liptrot, based on Liptrot's 2016 memoir. In the film, Liptrot has been transformed into Rona, a 29-year-old woman who, when we first meet her, has a black eye, having been nearly defeated by life. She's from a tiny village in the Orkney Islands, which lie off the northern coast of Scotland. Rona went to London to earn a graduate degree in biology, where she met friends and a man (Paapa Essiedu) she loved. But a latent propensity for addiction turned into a full-blown alcoholic spiral, and she wrecked her life completely.
Now, home with her very religious mother (Saskia Reeves), she is miserable and angry and unsure where to put all her feelings. Her father (Stephen Dillane), who has bipolar disorder, lives a chaotic life on a farm nearby, and Rona is close with them both. She can't get a good job, or really any job at all. But she is desperate to return to London, and terrified of slipping back into alcoholism and worse. Her salvation, she slowly realizes, lies in a more isolated and ascetic existence. In solitude, she'll be forced to face herself. But that means moving even further away from everything she's ever known.
The plot of "The Outrun" is quite simple. It's a recovery narrative, the kind that is vitally important to those who've lived it but that nonetheless has a fairly predictable shape: exhilaration, then rock bottom, then a slowly spiraling route toward healing, rife with setbacks and halting steps forward.
That's probably why Fingscheidt and Liptrot opted to tell Rona's story elliptically and, for long stretches, in a nonlinear fashion. The details of Rona's London life fill in slowly, along with experiences from her past -- particularly her father's disorder -- that likely have something to do with her own problems. Much of "The Outrun" is structured as flashbacks or fractured recollections, fuzzy, a little mushy.
They are, in short, the kind of memories that come back to a heavy drinker the morning after a blackout. Rona recalls them in ways that prompt in her, and in the audience, an appropriately painful full-body cringe. Those memories pop up so often, and with such pain, that the movie gets dangerously close to being overwrought. But Ronan's restraint keeps it truthful, even when she's screaming, or crying, or blacking out. In the end, it mostly aches, and aches, and aches.
"The Outrun" circles around a central question, which is this: Is it possible for an alcoholic to ever be happy without alcohol? To put it another way: If you're an alcoholic, can sobriety be compatible with a happy life? Rona asks this of another sober alcoholic, the grocer in the tiny island she moves to in search of life. His answer is the opposite of cheery movie pablum, mostly because he doesn't know how to respond. "It never gets easy," he says. "It just gets less hard." The truth of the answer stings her and him at once, but the expression rolling across Rona's face as she takes it in feels true, and about more than just alcoholism. Not everyone is an addict, but everyone has something that threatens to take them down. Life doesn't get easy. It just gets less hard.
The strange and wild natural world plays a key role in Rona's healing, and Fingscheidt's capturing of the greens and grays and blues of the Orkneys feels chilly, bracing and wondrous. This tiny island stands in sharp contrast to her blurry London world, and even the slightly grimy village where her parents live. You can almost taste the salt and feel the sting on your skin: clean, gritty, a little painful, entirely exhilarating. Which is what healing is like. Which is how it feels to meet the world, broken and battered and born anew.

Changing of the Guard Atop Sony Pictures
Sony Pictures Entertainment said on Monday that its chief executive, Tony Vinciquerra, will step down at the beginning of next year and be succeeded by the studio's president and chief operating officer, Ravi Ahuja, right.
Mr. Ahuja, 53, will report to Kenichiro Yoshida, who runs the Sony Group, the Tokyo-based technology and entertainment giant. Mr. Vinciquerra, 70, will serve as nonexecutive chairman of Sony Pictures through the end of next year.
Mr. Ahuja's appointment is a relatively tranquil change by the standards of Hollywood corner offices, where chief executives are sometimes replaced in a much less decorous fashion. Bob Bakish, the chief executive of Paramount, was abruptly replaced in April during merger negotiations with Skydance, and Robert A. Iger's succession at Disney has been a yearslong struggle.
Tranquillity was the last word used to describe Sony seven years ago when Mr. Vinciquerra took over for Michael Lynton. The company was reeling from an industry-rattling cyberattack that laid bare many of the company's internal communications.
Mr. Vinciquerra oversaw Sony's TV and movie strategy at a time of profound disruption for the entertainment industry, as competitors like Disney were preparing to debut major streaming services. Mr. Vinciquerra took a different approach. Sony instead adopted an "arms dealer" strategy, profiting off the early days of the streaming gold rush by selling movies and TV shows to traditional media companies.
"I thought to myself, 'Well, we could go do the same thing and spend billions of dollars and compete with everybody,"' Mr. Vinciquerra said in an interview on Monday. "And just from experience, it was obvious that if you do the same thing as everybody else, you'll end up in the same place."

MEDIA
Tech Columnist Plans To Start Own Newsletter
Taylor Lorenz, the high-profile tech columnist for The Washington Post, said on Tuesday that she was leaving the publication to start her own subscription newsletter on Substack.
Her newsletter, User Mag, will continue her reporting on internet culture and the creator economy, covering "who has power on the internet and how that power is being wielded," she said in an introduction post.
Ms. Lorenz said in an interview that she would keep hosting the Vox Media podcast "Power User" and now be free to do collaborations with other content creators and take up opportunities she wasn't able to do at The Post.
"I want to be able to publish whatever I want, whenever I want, and I want to get the upside of breaking news," she said.
Ms. Lorenz was a technology reporter for The New York Times from 2019 to 2022. She previously worked at outlets including The Daily Beast, The Atlantic and Business Insider and wrote a best-selling book, "Extremely Online," which chronicled the rise of power and fame on the internet.
She has been the focus of criticism on social media in recent years, and sometimes clashed with editors.
In 2022, she posted on Twitter, now known as X, that a miscommunication with her editor at The Post had led to an inaccurate line in an article. Those tweets were discussed and agreed on by Ms. Lorenz and editors before she posted them, but they prompted an outcry from online critics who accused her of passing the buck.

Star-Studded, Edgy and Now Under a Cloud: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The events helped the music mogul raise his profile. But one woman who worked at them has said in court papers that the parties had a dark side, too.
In the 2000s, few events held the cultural cachet of the White Party thrown by Sean Combs -- fetes in Beverly Hills, the Hamptons and other playgrounds of the rich, studded with famous names and fabulous tableaus.
At the 2009 party, Demi Moore made the scene with Lil' Kim, dancers gyrated in giant plastic balloons alongside tottering stilt walkers, and Ashton Kutcher swung, Tarzan-like, across a swimming pool as models in white bikinis lounged beside it.
And at the center of it all was Mr. Combs, the billionaire hip-hop mogul also known as Puff Daddy and Diddy, invariably toasting the scene with a glass of Cîroc vodka, and welcoming comparisons of his revels to those of lore.
"Have I read 'The Great Gatsby'?" Mr. Combs once told The Independent. "I am the Great Gatsby!"
Today, Mr. Combs's fortunes again invite comparison to Gatsby, though now through scandal. Prosecutors say Mr. Combs enlisted employees, enablers and prostitutes to stage far darker soirees than White Parties called "freak-offs" -- drug-heavy, sometimes days-long hotel parties during which investigators say he abused and coerced participants into sexual acts, which he sometimes filmed and masturbated to.
The criminal indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court this month has invited something of a reappraisal of the White Parties for some of those who reveled or worked at them. Were they merely innocuous, press-conscious branding events at which to see and be seen? Or was there, beyond the all-white facade, a darker element?
Indeed, a recent lawsuit claims misdeeds occurred at those events, too: In July, Adria English, who was hired by Mr. Combs to work a series of White Parties in the mid-to-late 2000s, sued him, asserting she was plied with drugs and ecstasy-laced liquor at the events, and commanded to have sex with certain guests, making her into "a sexual pawn." Jonathan Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, denied in July that his client had ever "sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone."
In a statement on Saturday from Mr. Combs's representatives, his camp denied that any wrongdoing had occurred at the White Parties.
"It's disappointing to see the media and social commentators twist these cultural moments into something they were not," the statement said. "Shaming celebrities who attended, taking video clips and photos out of context, and trying to link these events to false allegations is simply untrue."
The White Parties are not mentioned in the three-count indictment, which charges Mr. Combs, 54, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty, and his legal team has cast his prosecution as an example of "unjust prosecution" of consensual behavior.
"He is an imperfect person, but he is not a criminal," said Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, adding, "These are the acts of an innocent man with nothing to hide, and he looks forward to clearing his name in court."
Nonetheless, the charges have thrust Mr. Combs's parties back into the spotlight, as hundreds of photos of celebrities rubbing shoulders with the musician have resurfaced, including Hollywood A-listers like Leonardo DiCaprio, the writer Salman Rushdie, and Donald J. Trump, an indication of Mr. Combs's broad reach into worlds of music, movies, fashion and more.
Few of the attendees have spoken in recent days about what it was like inside a Combs party, though celebrities of all stripes have over the years recounted what it was like to hang out with him, sometimes declining -- with smiles -- to provide more details.
No invitation, perhaps, was more coveted than one to a White Party, which Mr. Combs began to stage in the late 1990s. They were lavish, orchestrated events that seemed to be as much about public relations as carousing. Veteran celebrities mixed with of-the-moment stars and the high-society set at gatherings that often had civic-minded causes. The dress code and décor -- all white -- suggested a certain pristine simplicity.
"There were the beautiful people, but it also was a lot of Hamptons people, and young people, nightclub kids," said Patrick McMullan, the nightlife photographer, who attended some of the parties. "They all wanted to be part of that scene."
In her 114-page suit -- which included a "trigger warning" because of its graphic nature -- Ms. English, who said she worked at several White Parties in the mid-to-late 2000s, suggested the glamour was a facade. At one party, she said that Mr. Combs asked her to wear a black dress to indicate to other guests that she was available for sexual encounters. She said she was later paid $ 1,000 for an encounter with a guest, according to the court papers.
Ms. English, who had previously worked as an erotic dancer and adult film actress, also accused Mr. Combs in her suit of allowing other unidentified men to sexually assault her -- and filming the acts -- while she was unconscious at White Parties in New York, and his home in Star Island, Fla.
"The true nature of her employment at the White Parties was grotesque, inexcusable, exploitative and criminal," the suit says.
In responding to the suit in July, Mr. Combs's lawyer, Mr. Davis said: "We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason and without any proof. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth and Mr. Combs is confident he will prevail against these and other baseless claims in court."
One veteran of the Hamptons social scene said the accusations against Mr. Combs have led some to revisit their own experiences of attending a White Party.
"Everybody that could go, went," said R. Couri Hay, a New York City publicist who has also long written about the society scene in the Hamptons, though he said he now wondered "what was happening behind closed doors."
Mr. Hay agreed that the "public-facing" White Parties were meant to boost and promote Mr. Combs's image. "This was Puffy's Met Gala, this was Puffy's Oscars, this was Puffy's Grammy Awards," he said.
White Parties usually ran from daytime to the wee hours. Some guests brought their children -- as did Mr. Combs -- who gobbled free ice cream alongside stars. Brand-name sponsors plastered their names on white-carpeted backdrops and gave away swag. Invitees sometimes included, alongside high-profile celebrities and friends, some lesser-known models, at times recruited from New York City catwalk shows.
Once guests arrived, sometimes brought from Manhattan by the busload, waiters in white tuxedos circulated with champagne. Pains were taken to make sure the White Parties were well received in the Hamptons, said Nicholas Kraus, whom Mr. Combs hired to conduct diplomacy with his Long Island neighbors, including offering them limo rides and dinners at fancy restaurants on Mr. Combs's dollar, to stave off noise complaints.
No expense was spared, no detail overlooked: In 2004, Mr. Combs brought an original copy of the Declaration of Independence to a July 4 White Party in Bridgehampton, a borrowed relic -- from the television producer Norman Lear -- that was accompanied by a team of burly security officers.
"I promise not to spill champagne on it," Mr. Combs joked.
That fete -- which was promoted by Sony and also hosted by Jay-Z and Paris Hilton -- offered a buffet of upper-crust entertainment options, including badminton, horseback riding and croquet. It doubled as a kickoff event for a get-out-the-vote organization Mr. Combs had founded, Citizen Change, part of an effort he described to "make this election the hottest, most sexiest thing ever."
At the 2009 party in Beverly Hills, the settings and stagecraft was equally sumptuous, with scores of white ottomans and a custom-built trellis over the pool, wrapped in white gauze, from which Mr. Kutcher would later swing. The party promoted Malaria No More, a nonprofit that provides mosquito netting and other services in malarial zones. The dress code was strict, and enforced.
"White meant white," said T. Scott Case, the former chief executive officer of Malaria No More. "Don't be showing up in eggshell."
Some of the White Parties also had a sensual vibe. Models wore angel wings, and occasionally went topless. Photos from the bash in 1998 show Mr. Combs pouring champagne over two half-naked women.
As the celebrations transitioned from day to night, guests and hired models sometimes ended up in the pool, fully or partially naked, some attendees said.
Jay Blaze, a recording artist whose music was featured on Mr. Combs's reality competition show "Making the Band," attended the 2009 party, after showing up uninvited. Mr. Combs let him in, however, on the condition that he go on to "do good things for people."
As the sun set, Mr. Blaze said he grew uncomfortable. Drunk men bellowed at models in the pool, he said, groping or preventing them from getting into dry clothes. No one intervened.
"The response was: 'It's a hip-hop party, it's a Diddy party, it's the White Party,"' Mr. Blaze recalled.
At another White Party, held in 2006 at Nikki Beach, the famed beachside club in St. Tropez, guests encountered erotically charged photos, including two tongues entwined and Mr. Combs's hand over a woman's bikini bottom. Another photo showed the star shirtless, with his signature sunglasses and a pair of jewel-encrusted crosses dangling over his glistening chest. A yacht bobbed offshore.
Mr. Combs discontinued his White Parties after the Beverly Hills event in 2009; his representatives said that part of the reason was that the mogul was spending less time in the Hamptons. They added that the parties were "iconic, a true convergence of hip-hop, Hollywood and Black excellence," with "an endless stream of people vying to attend."
Now, however, after being denied bail, Mr. Combs is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. He could face life in prison if convicted of racketeering conspiracy; the other two charges also carry the potential for lengthy prison terms.

Sequel to a Video Game Expands a Fresh Sony Franchise: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The anticipated game, Ghost of Yotei, will follow a woman on a quest for vengeance in the snowy reaches of northern Japan.
Even before Ghost of Tsushima won players over with its samurai protagonist and cinematic flair inspired by Kurosawa films like "Yojimbo," its designers felt confident enough to start planning a sequel.
On Tuesday, Sucker Punch Productions announced Ghost of Yotei, the beginning of an official franchise that will include at least one movie and other spinoffs, putting the series alongside emblematic Sony PlayStation titles like God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn.
Nate Fox and Jason Connell, creative directors on Ghost of Tsushima, had long envisioned a spiritual successor to the 2020 game, which brought players to the periphery of the Japanese shogunate period, with the Mongol invasion of the country's Tsushima Island in the 1200s. Critics applauded the game's historical accuracy, and the players who bought 13 million copies eagerly speculated about a sequel.
An initial trailer for Ghost of Yotei, which is scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 5 next year, describes the game's setting as "beyond the edge of Japan" with an imposing image of Mount Yotei from what is now the country's northern Hokkaido region. After snowy scenes of battle and bloodshed, a woman named Atsu emerges, bowing to a wolf companion and looking ahead toward an unseen expanse.
"When we started working on a sequel, the first question we asked ourselves is 'What is the DNA of a Ghost game?"' Fox said. "It is about transporting the player to the romance and beauty of feudal Japan."
Inspiration for the new game's setting came during two research trips into northern Japan. The Sucker Punch team, which mostly resides in Washington State, visited more than a dozen locations. But it was the image of Mount Yotei reflected across Lake Toya that inspired awe.
"I sat there for two hours just staring at the mountain," Connell said of the active stratovolcano, which is similar in appearance to Mount Fuji. "It was stunning."
Fox said another highlight was Shiretoko National Park on the northeastern tip of Hokkaido, which he visited to record nature sounds for his audio team.
"Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears," Fox said. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying."
"We strive to bring that into the video game -- that feeling of danger."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Without going into detail, the developers said Ghost of Yotei was a story of "underdog vengeance" that followed Atsu as she moved through the natural landscape, including sprawling grasslands and snowy tundras. They said players would have greater control over her story than in the previous game.
"One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again," said Connell, noting that players would be able to master firearms in addition to melee weapons like the katana. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."
When Ghost of Yotei arrives, it will join a crowded thematic space.
The action-adventure franchise Assassin's Creed is releasing its own take on feudal Japan in February, and the Emmy-dominating television series "Shogun" is set in the 1600s when the Tokugawa shogunate dominated most of Japan but struggled to control Hokkaido. (Fox considers himself a fan of the television show and the book it was based on; his dog, an Australian labradoodle, is named Lord Toranaga after a main character.)
The sequel to Ghost of Tsushima is the linchpin to a series of tightly choreographed efforts by Sony to transform the series into a larger entertainment franchise. A cinematic version of the original game has been in development for several years under Chad Stahelski, who directed the "John Wick" films.
In recent years, game companies have achieved some critical and commercial success by turning their characters into Hollywood stars. The second-highest-grossing movie of last year was "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," which celebrated Nintendo's mascot and earned more than $ 1.3 billion at the box office. The year before, a movie based on Sony's Uncharted games made about $ 400 million.
Hermen Hulst, the chief executive of Sony's studio business group, said developing intellectual property across entertainment formats would drive customers back to the original games. "We saw the same with 'The Last of Us' on HBO," he said.
"From a business perspective it makes a lot of sense," Hulst said. "When a television series or movie comes out, people are inspired to play again or make friends to play."

Frank Coppa, 82, First Bonanno Capo To Flip on the Mafia Family, Is Dead: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His decision to describe murders to the F.B.I. led at least 10 other members of the Bonanno family to do the same and ultimately immobilized a mafia family.
The first domino to fall in the Bonanno crime family was Frank Coppa, a corpulent capo who once survived a car-bomb attack and procured fried chicken for hungry hit men before an execution.
In 2002, he was serving time for securities fraud when he was indicted on racketeering and extortion charges. Facing an even longer prison sentence, he notified the F.B.I. that he wanted to cooperate with the government.
It was the first time a Bonanno member had flipped, violating the mafia's solemn oath of loyalty, Omertà.
Mr. Coppa's decision to cooperate with federal prosecutors, knowingly putting his life at risk, led at least 10 other members to do the same and ultimately helped the government convict Joseph Massino, the Bonanno boss, of seven murder charges and immobilize his mafia family.
"Coppa's cooperation was the first major development in a series of prosecutions which, during their course, resulted in the indictment of virtually every high-ranking member of the Bonanno family," Amy Busa, a federal prosecutor, wrote in court papers. "Coppa's cooperation with the government has been truly historic."
In return, Mr. Coppa was sentenced to time served and entered the federal government's witness protection program. He died on Oct. 17, 2023, at his home in Sarasota, Fla., according to a death certificate obtained by The New York Times. No cause was listed. He was 82.
His death was first reported last month by "The Sit Down: A Crime History Podcast," a popular show for aficionados of mafia history.
After Mr. Coppa decided to flip, F.B.I. agents took him to the bureau's training facility in Quantico, Va., where he spent two weeks explaining the inner workings of the Bonanno family and narrating gruesome details of multiple murders, including two he helped set up.
In 2004, he testified in federal court against Mr. Massino, a close friend whose own rotundity was sneered at in the tabloid newspapers that were feasting on details spilling out of the trial, in Brooklyn.
The Daily News noted that Mr. Coppa had "turned over personal photos of the two fatsos vacationing together in Europe." The New York Post columnist Steve Dunleavy called Mr. Coppa a "mob turncoat" who "rolled over like a circus dog on a raft of wiseguys."
Mr. Coppa, known as Big Frank, spent two days on the witness stand describing a world seemingly drawn from a Mario Puzo novel, with characters nicknamed Bobby Wheelchairs, Sally Bagel, Gene the Hat, Patty from the Bronx and Little Nicky Eyeglasses.
At times, it got testy.
"How did you force people to do things, Mr. Coppa?" Mr. Massino's defense lawyer asked, according to the trial transcript. "You don't look like such a tough guy."
"I don't?" Mr. Coppa replied.
The proceedings were also banal, harrowing and surreal -- sometimes all at once.
One afternoon in 1978, Mr. Coppa testified, he left a bagel shop he had invested in and tried to get into his car.
"What happened?" a prosecutor asked.
"I got blown up," Mr. Coppa said.
"How were you injured?" a prosecutor said.
"Severely," Mr. Coppa said. "Blown apart."
He spent several months in a hospital recovering. He suspected that the bomber was another underworld figure with whom he was having a dispute. Mr. Coppa sent several Bonanno members to kill the man. They shot him five times in his driveway in Staten Island. He survived.
A few months later, the man called Mr. Coppa.
"He was trying to see if I did it," Mr. Coppa testified. "I told him, 'Don't worry about it, go about your life."' He added, "I wasn't sure if he did it, and I was sorry that I had him shot."
Mr. Coppa also detailed his role in the death of Dominick Napolitano, a Bonanno member, known as Sony Black, who was executed in 1981 for unwittingly connecting the family with an undercover F. B.I agent, Joseph D. Pistone, who used the alias Donnie Brasco. Mr. Pistone later wrote a book about that experience and was played by Johnny Depp in "Donnie Brasco," a 1997 film adaptation.
The night of Mr. Napolitano's murder, Mr. Coppa testified, he had bought fried chicken for the hit men as they prepared for the execution, at a Bonanno member's house in Queens.
It happened while Mr. Massino waited in a car nearby. Mr. Coppa, guarding the home's front door, let Mr. Napolitano in for a prearranged meeting in the basement. Mr. Coppa testified that he heard three shots soon after they descended the stairs -- one, then a pause, then two more. It turned out that one of the assassin's guns had jammed. The other Bonanno associate finished the job.
"He died like a man," Mr. Coppa testified.
Though he carried a .38-caliber revolver most of his life, Mr. Coppa was never accused of pulling the trigger in a murder. His toughness, especially when it came to doing time, was questionable. He acknowledged in court that when he went to prison for the first time, in 1992, he cried uncontrollably for days.
Among law enforcement officials, Mr. Coppa was known as a clever wise guy. He made millions of dollars for himself and the Bonanno family in pump-and-dump schemes, boosting the value of penny stocks to quickly turn a profit. He also shook down underworld figures outside the Bonanno family who were engaging in securities fraud.
"He was one of the smartest mob guys you're ever going to meet," a former F.B.I. agent involved in the case said in an interview on the condition of anonymity so that he could speak about the investigation. "He understood how to engineer these financial frauds. He was at a completely different level when it came to most of these guys."
The former agent said he believed that Mr. Coppa had been remorseful.
"One of the reasons he cooperated is that I think he regretted his participation in the violent stuff when he was younger," the official said. "He lived off that reputation for many years. But he was actually likable in a way."
Frank Coppa was born on Sept. 11, 1941, in Brooklyn, according to his death certificate, which listed his parents as Michael Coppa and Marianna Mattera.
During his testimony, Mr. Coppa sketched out a blue-collar upbringing. He said his father was a stevedore. As a teenager, Frank waited tables and bagged groceries. His first arrest was when he was 19, charged with burglarizing a clothing store. He later drove school buses, he testified.
Mr. Coppa testified that he met Mr. Massino in 1977 at the Fulton Fish Market and that he became a soldier in the Bonanno family not long after, joining a criminal enterprise founded and ruled by Joseph Bonanno for more than three decades until the mid-1960s. The two men became close friends, even vacationing with their wives in Monte Carlo and Paris, where Mr. Massino bought Mr. Coppa rosary beads to carry in his wallet.
Mr. Massino was convicted in the 2004 trial and received two life sentences. Not long after, he decided to cooperate with the government, serving as a prosecution witness against other mafia figures. He was released into the witness protection program and died last year.
Details of Mr. Coppa's life after working with the F.B.I. are unclear.
During Mr. Massino's trial, Mr. Coppa said he hoped the government would let him keep about $ 2 million that he had stashed away, along with several homes and vehicles. It is believed that Mr. Coppa left the witness protection program years ago, when the depleted Bonanno crime family was no longer a threat to his life.
Public records listed him as residing in Sarasota in a high-rise condominium, which his wife, Marguerite Coppa, purchased in 2010 for $ 457,500, according to the deed.
Information about his survivors was not available.
While on the witness stand, Mr. Coppa testified about his induction into the Bonanno crime family. He was taken to an apartment in Brooklyn, where he waited in a bathroom as the leadership team inducted other new members in the living room.
Soon it was his turn. He joined hands with the leaders.
"What was the oath that you took?" the prosecutor asked.
"Oath of silence," Mr. Coppa said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gabriela Ortiz's orchestral music, Jonas Kaufmann's Puccini tribute and Nathalie Stutzmann's first album from Atlanta are among the highlights.
Gabriela Ortiz: 'Revolución Diamantina'
Los Angeles Philharmonic; María Dueñas, violin; Gustavo Dudamel, conductor (Platoon)
I know what I'll be rooting for on Oct. 9, when Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic begin Gabriela Ortiz's season as the resident composer at Carnegie Hall: namely, something on the level of the spitfire violin concerto "Altar de Cuerda," which opens this survey of her music, performed by the same orchestra and conductor. Just as the soloist, María Dueñas, ventures from tremulous, weeping articulations to slashing outbursts with impressive security, so too does the Philharmonic snap back and forth with alertness when approaching Ortiz's contrasting, hurtling designs in the opening movement. In the slow middle movement, the mercurial, slowly morphing orchestral harmonies reach out to American Minimalism and Finnish spectralism alike. And the finale boasts hints of Romantic effusion.
Less successful, to my ear, is what follows. The curtain-raising morsel "Kauyumari" is effective but plainly modest. And the ballet score "Revolución Diamantina" can sound bogged down by its heavy conceptual program, inspired by a 2019 feminist protest in Mexico. The writing seems less instantly memorable than in the concerto. Syllabic dyads for chorus might make you think you're hearing a distillation of Philip Glass's "Einstein on the Beach." The score traffics in rather direct, and extended, references to Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring." So, when Ortiz presents a new concerto, for the cellist Alisa Weilerstein, at Carnegie, let's hope the result feels more like this recording of "Altar de Cuerda." SETH COLTER WALLS
'Puccini: Love Affairs'
Jonas Kaufmann, tenor; Pretty Yende, Anna Netrebko, Sonya Yoncheva, Malin Byström, Asmik Grigorian, Maria Agresta, sopranos; Orchestra del Teatro Comunale di Bologna; Asher Fisch, conductor (Sony)
After establishing himself as the great spinto tenor of his generation, Jonas Kaufmann got a little sidetracked. Movie-music projects and a 140-minute Christmas album were almost defiantly corny. A listener might be forgiven for approaching a record called "Love Affairs" with trepidation.
In this tribute to Puccini, on the centenary of his death, Kaufmann's voice, having lost some of its sheen and youthful vim, is growlier and less swoony than it used to be. Individual notes sound mightily impressive, but whole phrases can feel labored, with bumpy lines and dry, blunt-force climaxes. Still, when Kaufmann rallies, heroic highs and breathtaking diminuendos are reminders of the technique that made him a marvel.
Even as audiences clamored for his Wagner interpretations, Kaufmann kept Puccini in his repertoire. On this disc, his easy star power enlivens Cavaradossi's suavity and Dick Johnson's rugged, weary machismo. The rosy, rhapsodic impetuousness of Rodolfo and Pinkerton, those fools who rush in, eludes Kaufmann. Asher Fisch's conducting is exceedingly deferential.
It's a measure of Kaufmann's clout that he was able to get half a dozen acclaimed sopranos, including Sonya Yoncheva (a ripe, sensual Tosca) and Anna Netrebko (a haggard Manon Lescaut), to jump on an otherwise routine recording. Best of all: Asmik Grigorian's haunted Giorgetta, in an excerpt from "Il Tabarro," which draws a fatalistic ardor out of Kaufmann that might surprise listeners. No trepidation required. OUSSAMA ZAHR
Kraft and C.P.E. Bach: Cello Concertos
Jean-Guihen Queyras, cello; Ensemble Resonanz; Riccardo Minasi, conductor (Harmonia Mundi)
Antonín Kraft (1749-1820) was one of the notable cellists of his time, and among the first players of works by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. He published only a small amount of his own music, and it places his instrument front and center -- including the concerto in C, which is given an irresistible performance on this album.
Written around the turn of the 19th century, the piece harks back to the style of a few decades earlier, but without any staleness. The first movement is Allegro aperto ("fast and open"), a characteristic tempo marking of Mozart's that suggests dashing good cheer, a quality captured by the crisp, headlong playing of the cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras and Ensemble Resonanz, led by Riccardo Minasi. The Andante is graceful, and the finale -- a "Rondo alla Cosacca" with an elegant cast over its folkish robustness -- is a hearty showcase for Queyras's rich tone and easy virtuosity, down to the wittily understated ending.
Queyras, Minasi and Resonanz previously recorded two of C.P.E. Bach's mid-18th-century cello concertos; the third is included on the new disc, and here has a ruminative Adagio between vibrant outer movements, and tight unity between soloist and ensemble throughout. But the revelation here is Kraft. ZACHARY WOOLFE
Dvorak: Symphony No. 9, "From the New World"; American Suite
Atlanta Symphony Orchestra; Nathalie Stutzmann, conductor (Erato)
One of the many things that marks Nathalie Stutzmann as a conductor of note is the strength with which she holds her artistic convictions. When I interviewed her two years ago, as she prepared to take over at the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, she spoke insistently of her belief that to respect a score is to breathe life into it, to fill it with feeling, and not simply to follow its every direction to the letter. "More than for perfection we are striving for that shared emotion," she writes in the notes for this stylish Dvorak recording. It's her first as a conductor alone.
Much of the promise, and some of the peril, of Stutzmann's taste for subjectivity are on show in her reading of the "New World" Symphony, recorded live last November. She draws a full, bold sound from the orchestra, and the volatility with which she uses it guarantees surprises throughout. The highlight is the slow movement, ardent and stretched yet graced with beguiling patience. Elsewhere, Stutzmann so often displays such a wonderfully easy way with tempo, as in much of the finale, that the few moments when she most brazenly stokes the drama stick out and frustrate, nowhere more blatantly than at the end of the first movement. The American Suite is a sensible filler on an intriguing debut. DAVID ALLEN
'Keel Road'
Danish String Quartet (ECM)
How can one ensemble be so good at so many things? The Danish String Quartet has already been highly (and rightly) lauded for its way with late Beethoven and knotty 20th-century repertoire and for its forays into contemporary music. Now comes the latest of its journeys into European folk music traditions, following 2014's "Wood Works" and 2017's "Last Leaf." The "road" being explored here is the North Sea, in music stretching from the quartet's native Scandinavia to the Faroe Islands to England and Ireland. Again the quartet mixes arrangements of folk songs -- including four by the Irish harpist Turlough O'Carolan -- with their own compositions.
Some of the qualities of "Keel Road" are familiar from earlier efforts in this segment of the foursome's repertoire. There's no trace of kitsch. They bring to this music the same virtues as their more canonical pursuits: unified and natural phrasing, and crack ensemble playing. The arrangements are coolly resourceful, and their own tunes are so idiomatic you could easily mistake them for being "authentic" folk music.
All well and good, but some deeper force takes over on the final track, a Norwegian song called "Nar Mitt Oye, Trett Av Moye" ("When My Eyes, Sore With Weeping"). Having listened to it several dozen times, I remain at a loss to explain how these four musicians create such pathos from a simple old folk tune. Their arrangement gives it an almost Beethovenian depth of feeling -- sadness and joy turning inescapably into each another. DAVID WEININGER

The Evening 'S.N.L.' Sprang to Life: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When it debuted 50 years ago, "S.N.L." was chaotic, rangy, even offensive. But nothing's wild or crazy in Jason Reitman's fictional reimagining of its first episode.
Movies about tectonic cultural shifts tend to be too neat and tidy, too frictionless. "Saturday Night," the director Jason Reitman's fictional reimagining of the debut of "Saturday Night Live," is a nice, safe movie about a revolution. Busily plotted and sporadically funny, it is a backstage look at the night a gang of comics whom most of the world had never heard of began taking over TVs across the country. It was a comedy home invasion on a national scale, and it was glorious (when it didn't suck).
The movie, written by Reitman and Gil Kenan, has a straightforward conceit. It opens at on Oct. 11, 1975, the night that the show, then called "NBC's Saturday Night," is scheduled to debut. (The name was changed in 1977.) In just 90 minutes -- ticktock -- the show will go live if the performers, writers, crew, network suits and some guy named Lorne can get it together in time. A lot of money, reputations and possibly bright futures are riding on the show, but with its deadline looming, it still seems underbaked and, from some vantage points, overly abstract.
To convey that premiere and what it portended, Reitman both sticks to the historical record and embellishes it, building momentum by zeroing in on some mini-crisis amid rapid edits, swish pans and rushing bodies. Everything and everyone at 30 Rockefeller Plaza runs too fast or seems immobilized, with characters either in frenetic motion or huddling in pools of flop sweat. As the minutes pass, Reitman periodically cuts to a clock onscreen or someone calls out the time; at one point, a set designer, Leo Yoshimura (Abraham Hsu), slowly begins installing bricks on the stage of Studio 8H, each brick an emblem of the show's parts sliding into place.
In a (real) 1975 news release, NBC called the show "a new concept in late-night programming." The network wanted a replacement for weekend reruns of "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson," and this venture was going to be a comedy show with sketches, musical guests, short films and the Muppets. But it was unclear what it was, maybe even to those behind the scenes. That much seems obvious when an NBC executive, Dick Ebersol (Cooper Hoffman), asks the show's creator-producer, Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle), if he knows what it is. The straight-faced Lorne responds with an amusing, self-aggrandizing analogy involving Edison, the lightbulb and electricity. Who are you in this metaphor, the baffled exec asks.
Lorne doesn't answer, but the movie does by making him its focus. The character is less interesting than his surroundings -- he's more a blurry place holder than a fully realized personality -- but whether here or there, Lorne is the center of this storm. He's the hub, the visionary, the guy who can see past the chaos. Sure, there's his wife, the writer Rosie Shuster (a tart Rachel Sennott); the host, George Carlin (Matthew Rhys); and a creepy suit, Dave Tebet (Willem Dafoe, in by far the funniest turn). But the star is Lorne because even genius apparently needs a boss.
So, hi Chevy Chase (Cory Michael Smith), Gilda Radner (Ella Hunt), Jane Curtin (Kim Matula), Laraine Newman (Emily Fairn), Dan Aykroyd (Dylan O'Brien), Garrett Morris (Lamorne Morris, no relation) and John Belushi (Matt Wood). It's nice to see them, so it's too bad that only a few of the actors playing the main cast -- and only the men -- manage to register. That's the case even when Reitman gestures at the show's gender problems, as in a peek at a still-funny sketch about female construction workers learning how to harass a guy in short shorts. It's Dan's squirmy embarrassment, and how he then wags his rump, that makes it work.
Reitman does better when he takes on the show's racial homogeneity, largely by foregrounding Garrett. Long the only Black cast member, the real Garrett Morris held his own despite some ghastly treatment, which, in the movie, his fictional counterpart expresses by belting, "I'm going to get me a shotgun and kill all the whities I see." Lorne Michaels helped write the song, and Garrett Morris sang it while wearing prison stripes in a later episode for a sketch set in prison.
The song is queasily, gleefully tasteless, though I still don't know what we're being asked to laugh at, and at whose expense? Does it punch up or down, and where does it land? I mean, I laughed when I heard it again in the movie. Among other things, I have been taught by comedy, including by "S.N.L" itself -- which rocked my teenage world to the point that I used to hang out at 30 Rock looking for cast members -- to laugh at stereotypes, something the show certainly excelled in and the movie smartly evades. It's another question whether "S.N.L.," which has a famously terrible record when it comes to diversity, has encouraged viewers to interrogate stereotypes or just enjoy them and move along. It's only a joke, right?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Saturday Night" is a movie made by fans, but because Reitman assumes that his viewers are fans, too, and because he's racing against the clock, he gestures at instead of digging into the show, its humor and history. He nods at the generational shifts in comedy and TV, and tweaks the censors. Yet there's not enough about how the show's comedy works, and why one sketch kills and another dies. And there's no sense of how it works as television. The medium's intimacy can make you feel as if you're in on the subversion, though nothing can prepare you for the destabilizing conceptual genius of Andy Kaufman (Nicholas Braun) lip-syncing -- to you, in your parents' home! -- the theme of an old cartoon you watched as a child.
It's agreeable hanging again with Kaufman, however adulterated this version is. The same holds true of the rest of the crew, even if it's often like watching children play dress up at a party, one that Reitman keeps flowing, never mind that none of this should flow. It should stagger, erupt and nearly or entirely go off the rails. There's no danger of that happening in a movie that is finally about a nice boss, a benign paterfamilias, tending to his unruly charges. There's no doubt of the real Michaels's importance to "S.N.L." Yet when I -- and I bet you -- think about the show that's helped define pop culture for half a century, it isn't Michaels who comes to mind. It's the comedy that happened with and around him, but also, sometimes, despite him.

Nintendo Follows the Path of Originality: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Shigeru Miyamoto has been making the same request of all new employees at Nintendo for at least the past decade: For the love of all things Super Mario, please design games that might sell 30 million copies.
The request for smash hits that can generate upward of $ 1.5 billion sounds almost reasonable coming from Miyamoto, a smiling septuagenarian with arched eyebrows and a trove of beloved cultural properties that would make Walt Disney blush.
Despite creating mascots like Super Mario, Princess Zelda and Donkey Kong that have earned billions for Nintendo, Miyamoto dresses like a humble salaryman, wearing company merchandise beneath his blazer. He has consulted on dozens of games and was instrumental in the development of the Wii and Switch consoles, but in recent years has focused on the movies and amusement parks that Nintendo hopes will undergird its future.
"I actually don't know why I create the things I create," Miyamoto said through an interpreter during a private interview this week. "I'm just having fun and that is what drives me."
He was speaking from inside the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan, an exhibition hall that opens on Oct. 2 and documents the company's evolution from a local storefront selling handmade playing cards in the 1880s to a video game company nearly a century later.
Unsurprisingly, the museum is mostly dedicated to that second chapter, which opens on Miyamoto's arrival at the company. (His father, an English teacher from the Kyoto suburbs, had arranged an interview with Nintendo's president at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi.) Four years later, in 1981, Miyamoto made himself essential by inventing the Donkey Kong arcade cabinets, which introduced an early version of the character Mario and became an international hit.
"Mr. Yamauchi back in the day would tell us that we are not good at fighting: 'We are weak -- so don't go picking fights with other companies,"' Miyamoto said, explaining the company's longstanding pursuit of originality.
He shared that goal with Gunpei Yokoi, the inventor of the Game Boy, who worked with him on Donkey Kong. The working relationship was initially distant. "We talked and he provided feedback," Miyamoto said. "Some critical feedback, as well." But the colleagues grew close: Yokoi was a witness at his wedding, and Miyamoto said he remained in contact with the inventor's widow.
Following the path of originality has defined Miyamoto's work on recent Nintendo consoles and, by extension, the company's counterintuitive approach to an industry largely driven by expensive graphical realism.
"It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special," Miyamoto said. "There is a lot of talk about A.I., for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction."
The museum itself represents the third and latest chapter of Nintendo's history: its transformation from a video game company into a global entertainment brand. Through concrete and nostalgia, Nintendo is declaring -- perhaps for the first time -- that it sees itself as a permanent fixture in popular culture.
Just a decade ago, industry analysts believed that Nintendo's only chance of survival after the failed launch of the Wii U was to stop producing consoles and focus on software development. The press was brutal. "What the Hell Is Wrong With Nintendo?" asked the Wired editor Chris Kohler. In 2013, Bloomberg News published an article pointing out that Sony and Microsoft "each sold more consoles in 24 hours than the Wii U maker did in nine months."
For the first time in its modern history, Nintendo -- the first part of its name, "Ninten," translates to "leave luck to heaven," a gambling prayer -- was reporting annual financial losses to investors.
A branding decision to piggyback off the name and considerable success of its previous console, the motion-controlled Wii, left the market confused. Buyers were later outraged when the console released with impaired functionality, which led the company's president at the time, Satoru Iwata, to issue an apology.
No Wii U game came close to Miyamoto's 30-million-copies metric of success. The highest-selling title, Mario Kart 8, sold 8.46 million units.
At the museum on the outskirts of Kyoto, however, the Wii U is represented with pride alongside the Super Nintendo, the GameCube and the rest of the company's console lineup: enshrined on the second floor.
Oddities crowd the corners. A toy rifle and a baby stroller are saved for a back display subtitled as the company's "age of exploration." The language is more direct in Japanese, describing a period from the company's founding to as far ahead as into its video game era as the "age of challenge."
The museum has almost no written explanations and Nintendo is not providing guided tours, leaving visitors without the context to know that licensed games like Twister and an early partnership with Disney were among the steps that allowed the company to negotiate its own products onto Japanese shelves. Additional research is necessary to learn that the Famicom, the precursor to the Nintendo Entertainment System, was on the cutting edge of technology in 1983: an online adapter allowed users to check the weather, conduct banking and place bets on horse races.
Miyamoto said the lack of explanations would allow visitors to intuitively understand Nintendo. "We wanted to make sure that this is someplace that regardless of any language or cultural barrier, people can come to interact and understand," he said.
The company was revived by the Nintendo Switch in 2017. Initial games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild were critical and commercial successes. The coronavirus pandemic also coincided with the release of cozy games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which attracted casual players looking for a virtual taste of fresh air, or "essentially peace in electronic form," as one young player said. Both games exceeded Miyamoto's sales target by millions of copies.
Behind the scenes, Miyamoto was also enacting a strategic plan to extend the Nintendo brand to new audiences and revenue streams. He now sits on the company's board of directors but also holds the title of "Executive Fellow," which at another company might be seen as the chief creative officer who oversees the development of new products.
After years of ignoring the surge in mobile gaming, the company developed apps like Super Mario Run, which Miyamoto joked during a presentation with Apple could be played while eating a hamburger. (In what appears to be a subtle reference, the museum cafe's only main dish is burgers.)
Miyamoto was also making trips to Hollywood to develop "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," which became the second-highest-grossing film of last year at nearly $ 1.4 billion. The movie released two months after the opening of Super Nintendo World at Universal Studios Hollywood, the second of four planned theme parks around the world. Now there is a Mario movie sequel planned for release in 2026 and development work on a Zelda film.
How the company will evolve into a media brand is on Miyamoto's mind, especially as he considers broadening the museum to include more archival records, past console prototypes and artistic drawings.
"If we get to a point where we make 10 movies, maybe we can open a theater next door," Miyamoto said during a news conference at the museum.
It is no surprise that the Nintendo Museum takes some of its design cues from the cotton-candy amusements that will delight children. Floating question blocks and singing Toads native to the Mushroom Kingdom of the Mario games are spread throughout the museum property -- a sterile building from 1969 that originally housed a manufacturing plant for playing cards before it was repurposed in 1988 as a customer service center for product repairs.
The museum offers other interactive experiences, including the chance to paint versions of the company's original playing cards. In another section, visitors can use comically large controllers to play old Nintendo games; extend a mechanical arm to grab balls; test their love matches with partners; and swing a cushioned bat around a fake living room.
These exhibits allow Nintendo, which declined to say how many employees worked at the museum, who managed it or what it cost to renovate the building, to keep the finer points of its history wrapped in mystery.
Today's audiences recognize the company brand through its riotous colors and cheerful designs; even the company's logo is painted the same vivid color as Mario's red cap. But its Kyoto headquarters are shockingly sterile, housed inside a white rectangular office building with an interior design that Miyamoto has lovingly compared to a hospital waiting room.
There are many tourists who travel to Kyoto to marvel at the nondescript building, even as the pagoda roofs of 800-year-old shrines like Tofuku-ji temple tower in the distance. Some Nintendo officials hope those tourists will now flock a few train stops away to the museum instead, though the company remains torn between discretion and transparency.
"When I put myself in the consumer's perspective, I kind of want to see behind the curtains," Miyamoto admitted at the news conference.
"Creating a museum like this is very un-Nintendo-like," he added. "If Mr. Yamauchi saw this, he would probably say don't do it."

KYOTO, Japan — Shigeru Miyamoto has been making the same request of all new employees at Nintendo for at least the past decade: For the love of all things Super Mario, please design games that might sell 30 million copies.
The request for smash hits that can generate upward of $1.5 billion sounds almost reasonable coming from Miyamoto, a smiling septuagenarian with arched eyebrows and a trove of beloved cultural properties that would make Walt Disney blush.
Despite creating mascots like Super Mario, Princess Zelda and Donkey Kong that have earned billions for Nintendo, Miyamoto dresses like a humble salaryman, wearing company merchandise beneath his blazer. He has consulted on dozens of games and was instrumental in the development of the Wii and Switch consoles, but in recent years has focused on the movies and amusement parks that Nintendo hopes will undergird its future.
“I actually don’t know why I create the things I create,” Miyamoto said through an interpreter during a private interview this week. “I’m just having fun and that is what drives me.”
He was speaking from inside the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Japan, an exhibition hall that opens Oct. 2 and documents the company’s evolution from a local storefront selling handmade playing cards in the 1880s to a video game company nearly a century later.
Unsurprisingly, the museum is mostly dedicated to that second chapter, which opens on Miyamoto’s arrival at the company. (His father, an English teacher from the Kyoto suburbs, had arranged an interview with Nintendo’s president at the time, Hiroshi Yamauchi.) Four years later, in 1981, Miyamoto made himself essential by inventing the Donkey Kong arcade cabinets, which introduced an early version of the character Mario and became an international hit.
“Mr. Yamauchi back in the day would tell us that we are not good at fighting: ‘We are weak — so don’t go picking fights with other companies,’” Miyamoto said, explaining the company’s longstanding pursuit of originality.
He shared that goal with Gunpei Yokoi, the inventor of the Game Boy, who worked with him on Donkey Kong. The working relationship was initially distant. “We talked and he provided feedback,” Miyamoto said. “Some critical feedback, as well.” But the colleagues grew close: Yokoi was a witness at his wedding, and Miyamoto said he remained in contact with the inventor’s widow.
Following the path of originality has defined Miyamoto’s work on recent Nintendo consoles and, by extension, the company’s counterintuitive approach to an industry largely driven by expensive graphical realism.
“It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special,” Miyamoto said. “There is a lot of talk about AI, for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction.”
The museum itself represents the third and latest chapter of Nintendo’s history: its transformation from a video game company into a global entertainment brand. Through concrete and nostalgia, Nintendo is declaring — perhaps for the first time — that it sees itself as a permanent fixture in popular culture.
Just a decade ago, industry analysts believed that Nintendo’s only chance of survival after the failed launch of the Wii U was to stop producing consoles and focus on software development. The press was brutal. “What the Hell Is Wrong With Nintendo?” asked Wired editor Chris Kohler. In 2013, Bloomberg News published an article pointing out that Sony and Microsoft “each sold more consoles in 24 hours than the Wii U maker did in nine months.”
For the first time in its modern history, Nintendo — the first part of its name, “Ninten,” translates to “leave luck to heaven,” a gambling prayer — was reporting annual financial losses to investors.
A branding decision to piggyback off the name and considerable success of its previous console, the motion-controlled Wii, left the market confused. Buyers were later outraged when the console released with impaired functionality, which led the company’s president at the time, Satoru Iwata, to issue an apology.
No Wii U game came close to Miyamoto’s 30-million-copies metric of success. The highest-selling title, Mario Kart 8, sold 8.46 million units.
At the museum on the outskirts of Kyoto, however, the Wii U is represented with pride alongside the Super Nintendo, the GameCube and the rest of the company’s console lineup: enshrined on the second floor.
Oddities crowd the corners. A toy rifle and a baby stroller are saved for a back display subtitled as the company’s “age of exploration.” The language is more direct in Japanese, describing a period from the company’s founding to as far ahead as into its video game era as the “age of challenge.”

A Juicy Yet Serious British Drama About Royal Hubris: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: This taut and serious Amazon series chronicles the time when Prince Andrew was interviewed on TV about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.
"A Very Royal Scandal," available now on Amazon Prime Video, tells -- retells -- the story of when the BBC journalist Emily Maitlis interviewed Prince Andrew on television in 2019 about his relationship to Jeffrey Epstein. The very first thing he says in the interview is that "there is no good time to talk about Mr. Epstein and all things associated." Welp ...
The mini-series is tightly focused -- its three episodes cover the period just before the interview, the interview itself and the immediate aftermath, with a few key flashbacks -- but the show exists in a hall of mirrors of real-world scandals and media. "Royal" lives in the shadow of the crown, and in the shadow of "The Crown," and is part of a prestige-laundering industry that refashions tabloid ignominy and wretchedness into cool-toned, highbrow drama. And it follows the movie "Scoop," starring Gillian Anderson and Rufus Sewell, which premiered in April and is about the same interview.
Michael Sheen stars as Prince Andrew, depicted here as stuffy and frustrated, unappreciated by his brother and devoted to his mother, neither of whom we see. His daughters adore him, as does his ex-wife, but he insists that the happiest time in his life was fighting in the Falklands War. Royal staffers whisper that he is so insulated from the world that he's incapable of understanding it.
Ruth Wilson plays Maitlis (herself an executive producer of the mini-series), a harried mom devoted to Velcro rollers and late night Google sessions. Wilson drops her voice to more closely resemble Maitlis's, but it's so unconvincing that it makes the fictionalized Maitlis seem phony, as if she were stealing a move from the Elizabeth Holmes playbook.
The show plays out as a slow-motion car crash, a what-not-to-do case study for media relations -- or perhaps a what-to-do guide for interviewing the terminally hubristic. Anyone who watches the full interview could rightly wonder, "How could you be so stupid to sit for an interview like this and say things like that?" "Royal" does a thorough, energetic, juicy-but-serious job of answering.
And yet, the show can't escape its own admission that there are much bigger questions one could ask about rape, misogyny, money, secrecy and power. Maitlis has a pat monologue about the injustice of it all, but the call is coming from inside the mini-series.

Amazon Joins Hollywood's Top Lobbying Group: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Motion Picture Association has been wooing the company for years. The addition gives the group a lot more muscle.
Hollywood's top lobbying group, the Motion Picture Association, has a powerful new member: Amazon.
The tech giant's decision to join the M.P.A. after a long courtship reflects its ambition in the streaming and film businesses -- as well as the association's need to add muscle. "Welcoming Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios into our ranks will broaden our collective policymaking and content protection efforts," Charles H. Rivkin, the association's chief executive, said in an interview.
The association's other members are Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. The M.P.A. has not added a member since 2019, when Netflix joined. Mr. Rivkin, a former United States ambassador and assistant secretary of state, has since focused recruitment efforts on Amazon.
Amazon gained a foothold in the entertainment industry in the 2010s with unconventional series like "Transparent" and indie films like "Manchester by the Sea." The company has since grown its Prime Video streaming service into a colossus. Last year, Amazon spent $ 19 billion to make or acquire content (films, TV shows, music), up 14 percent from a year earlier.
In 2021, Amazon acquired Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer for $ 8.5 billion. MGM was a founding member of the M.P.A. in 1923. But the studio dropped its membership in 2005 amid an ill-fated merger with Sony. In Mr. Rivkin's membership discussions with Amazon, its purchase of MGM "changed the conversation," he said. In the years ahead, Amazon plans to roughly double MGM's theatrical slate to as many as 16 films annually.
Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, said in a statement that the company was "proud" to join the M.P.A. and its effort "to protect creators, content and consumers worldwide." Amazon has successfully worked with the association on piracy efforts over the last few years.
For decades, the M.P.A. reigned as one of the most powerful trade associations in Washington. Its influence waned in the 2000s with the arrival of lobbyists for Big Tech. The M.P.A. also suffered from budget cuts and glacial decision making, in part because of consolidation in the entertainment industry; member studios had become embedded inside media conglomerates with divergent interests.
The low point came in 2012, when the M.P.A. failed to push through the Stop Online Piracy Act, which was mostly aimed at piracy sites overseas. Google and other tech companies, including Amazon, mobilized to defeat the legislation, arguing that it would effectively allow the government to censor the internet.
Mr. Rivkin was hired in 2017 to reinvigorate the M.P.A. The association's priorities include strengthening copyright protections. It also lobbies to open markets and secure tax incentives to produce films. Mr. Rivkin has expanded the group's advocacy to include streaming.
The association also oversees the movie-ratings system in the United States and operates a separate unit to fight piracy. Last month, the M.P.A. helped shut down Fmovies, a Vietnam video site that trafficked in stolen Hollywood content, attracting 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.
With the addition of Amazon, the only significant Hollywood player that remains a nonmember is Apple.
"It used to be seen as a Northern versus Southern California battle," Mr. Rivkin said, referring to Hollywood and Silicon Valley. "That is so outdated. The lines have blurred."

Japan Tries to Reclaim Its Tech Stature: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Japanese chip companies are tapping billions of dollars and collaborating with foreign firms as part of new government policies that look outward.
China's envy-inducing success in using industrial policy to expand its economy and finance green manufacturing has helped kick off a fevered scrimmage among nations to develop and protect their own hometown businesses.
It has been 40 years since such competitive anxieties about a rising Asian power prompted this kind of embrace of government intervention among the biggest free-market economies.
Only then it was Japan, not China, that was the source of unease.
Michael Crichton's 1992 thriller, "Rising Sun," with its dark depiction of Japan's ruthless economic warriors, ruled the best-seller lists, alongside nonfiction titles that warned of the financial and technology juggernaut created by Japan's powerful government trade ministry.
In a 1990 survey, nearly two-thirds of Americans said Japanese investment in the United States posed a threat to American economic independence.
It turned out that the anxiety about Japan Inc. peaked just as the country began a long economic slide after the collapse of real estate and stock market bubbles.
Now, after a period of stagnation that Japan's economy ministry refers to as "the lost three decades," Tokyo is engaged in a multibillion-dollar industrial policy to jump-start the lackluster economy and recapture its position as a tech innovator.
This time, Japan is working with technology leaders in the United States and other countries -- a collaborative approach that decades earlier would have been unthinkable.
But even as Tokyo is pursuing less inward-looking policies, the political storm over a Japanese-led acquisition of U.S. Steel illustrates how the United States is increasingly moving to protect other key industries from foreign influence.
Tokyo's industrial policy focus today is on advanced forms of technologies ranging from batteries to solar panels, but the priority is reclaiming a bigger share of the global semiconductor industry, for which the Japanese government earmarked more than $ 27 billion over the past three years.
"In the future, the world will be divided into two groups: those that can supply semiconductors and those that only receive them," said Akira Amari, a senior official in Japan's ruling party who previously led the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. "Those are the winners and the losers."
Based on lessons learned over the past few decades, Japan is trying out a new playbook when it comes to chips, Mr. Amari said: "Now, we are collaborating with international partners from the very start."
Although other nations are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to gain an edge, Japan's efforts stand out because of its history of using industrial policy to develop quickly after World War II.
"It doesn't have to start from scratch," said Alessio Terzi, an economist at the European Commission. "This is already something that sets it apart from other countries."
The centerpiece of Japan's new industrial push is taking shape at a year-old construction site on Hokkaido, its northernmost island. The area is better known for champagne powder skiing in winter, lush carpets of flowers in summer and volcanic hot springs.
Across open pastures and not far from the Chitose airport is the rough outline of Rapidus Corporation's new semiconductor plant, still surrounded by a sprawling exoskeleton of silver scaffolding.
The factory, financed in part by billions of dollars of government money, is being developed by an unusual collaboration between Rapidus, a start-up Japanese chip maker, and the American tech company IBM. It will produce the so-called 2-nanometer chips, a technology that IBM pioneered at its lab in Albany, N.Y.
The idea for the partnership was conceived in the summer of 2020 with a phone call to Tetsuro Higashi, the chairman of Rapidus, from a friend, John E. Kelly III, a longtime executive at IBM.
"I thought he was maybe just calling to catch up," said Mr. Higashi, 75.
He wasn't. Mr. Kelly explained that IBM was developing a new generation of chips and wanted to produce them in Japan.
Mr. Higashi soon determined that no company in Japan was capable of mass-producing this kind of advanced logic chip. In his eyes, he said, it was a now-or-never moment.
"I knew if I refused IBM's call at this point, there would be nothing going forward," Mr. Higashi said. Japan, once the world's premier semiconductor manufacturer, had seen its market share fall from more than half in the 1980s to less than 10 percent. Without action, Mr. Higashi said, "Japan would just fall further and further behind in our technologies."
Mr. Higashi's next move was to reach out to Mr. Amari, the government's point person on industrial policy.
It was a good time to ask the Japanese government for help building a factory.
Pandemic-related shortages of everything from computer chips to sriracha and then skyrocketing energy costs stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine had refocused attention in Tokyo and capitals around the world on the importance of resilient and secure supply chains.
In 2020, Japan added new subsidies to encourage Japanese businesses producing essential products like semiconductors, wind turbines, vaccination syringes and rubber gloves to relocate operations back home or in nearby countries.
Meanwhile, rising tensions between the United States and China further undermined faith in a cooperative international order built on shared rules and open trade.
In 2021, the trade ministry introduced a more aggressive industrial policy. A primary reason for Japan's years of stagnation, the new planning committee concluded, was the government's excessive anti-regulatory, hands-off approach to the economy.
The ministry also looked at what major competitors like the United States, the European Union and China were doing, and then analyzed Japan's previous industrial and economic policies.
The "new direction" would not repeat the previous strategy of fostering and protecting certain sectors, the committee said. Instead, it would use the government's entire regulatory tool kit to pursue "mission-oriented projects" like promoting green technology and energy conservation.
The government's commitment would be "large-scale, long-term, well-planned," the committee said.
The ideas laid out mirror much of the latest thinking by economists like Mariana Mazzucato and Dani Rodrik, who have endorsed industrial policies to deal with issues like the green transition and digitalization.
Japan tried a wholly domestic approach to reviving its faltering chip industry 25 years ago. It merged several top Japanese chip-making businesses into one entity, Elpida Memory, and later showered it with public investment and loans.
In 2012, Elpida filed for bankruptcy, the largest bankruptcy of a Japanese manufacturer since World War II.
Today's semiconductor industry "is truly global," Mr. Amari said: Taiwanese firms produce chips designed in America, using equipment from the Netherlands and Japan.
Rapidus will receive technology from IBM for its high-performance semiconductors and has dispatched hundreds of engineers to the IBM research facility in Albany to help develop technologies for mass-producing the chips.
The government is backing both big gambles like Rapidus and smaller ones.
Japan wooed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the chip-making behemoth, to build a plant in the southern town of Kikuyo with investment from domestic players including Sony. The factory, financed in part by the government, opened in February.
"Without government intervention, the numerous projects currently underway in Japan would likely not have materialized," a conference at the Brookings Institution's Center for Asia Policy Studies noted in its wrap-up this spring.
There are skeptics in Japan. The Rapidus plant has drawn criticism over its ambitious timeline and its inability to attract more private-sector investment.
But Mr. Amari argues there is no alternative.
"Not taking on semiconductors now means you will be in the loser group from the start," he said. "Japan will never choose that."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Films by Mati Diop, Raoul Peck and Mike Leigh, among others, mesh the personal and political in engrossing, insistent ways.
Each year at the Toronto International Film Festival, I travel the world virtually, moving through space and time in vivid color and in black and white. On the first day alone of this year's event, which wraps Sunday, movies took me from Mexico to France, Benin, South Africa, the United States, England and Japan. One gift of an expansive, border-crossing festival like Toronto is that it reminds you there is far more to films than those that come out of that provincial town called Hollywood.
It's been a few rough years in the festival world, which continues to struggle with the aftershocks of the pandemic as well as the back-to-back 2023 actors and writers strikes, which left Toronto and other events with near-empty red carpets. Toronto endured another sizable hit when it lost a longtime major backer (Bell Canada). Since then, the festival has added a fleet of new sponsors and a market for buying and selling movies, a venture backed by major money from the Canadian government. That's great news for this festival and for the enduring health of the film world, which is sustained and rejuvenated by the kinds of aesthetically adventurous, independently minded movies showcased at Toronto and other festivals.
The other welcome news involves the good and the great, the provocative and the divisive movies headed your way in the coming months. Despite the usual grumblings about the program's offerings (I've heard from other programmers that 2024 is a fairly weak year) and a sense that Toronto seems less vital than in the past, this year's lineup did what it reliably does each fall. It helped restore my faith that however catastrophic the state of the movie industry seems to be, there are always filmmakers making worthy and even transcendent documentaries and narrative fiction. The forecast is often gloomy in movieland, but visionaries like Mati Diop and art-house stalwarts like Mike Leigh and Pedro Almodóvar are keeping the sky from falling.
In 2019, Diop, a Senegalese-French director born in Paris, made history at Cannes with her debut feature, "Atlantics," when she became the first Black woman in the event's main competition. (It won the Grand Prix, or second prize.) A dreamily haunting, haunted tale of love and loss, leaving and staying, "Atlantics" centered on a woman whose male true love leaves Senegal for Europe, a project that Diop likened to "the Odyssey of Penelope" when we spoke at Cannes. In her latest, "Dahomey" -- which won top honors at the Berlin festival -- Diop charts another fraught course, this time by exploring the political and philosophical questions raised when France returned 26 stolen treasures to Benin in 2019.
"Dahomey" is a stunning exploration of cultural and artistic patrimony in the wake of colonialism; it's one of the great movies of the year. (It will be at the New York Film Festival soon.) Running a richly complex, perfect 68 minutes, "Dahomey" opens in Paris and wryly announces its themes with a shot of gaudily colored Eiffel Tower souvenirs of the kind sometimes sold by African street vendors. From there, Diop skips over to the Quai Branly Museum where the treasures -- which were looted in 1892 by French troops when Benin was known as Dahomey -- are being packed up for their momentous trip home. By the time one of the statues began speaking in bassy, hypnotic voice-over, I was thoroughly hooked.
Another of my festival highlights was the documentary "Ernest Cole: Lost and Found," the latest from the Haitian filmmaker Raoul Peck. (His earlier Toronto entries include "I Am Not Your Negro.") Engrossing from start to painful end, "Ernest Cole" traces the life, the creative awakening and artistic flowering, as well as the crushingly difficult times, of its title subject, a brilliant photographer who was born in 1940 near Pretoria, South Africa. At once the story of a man and of the country he bravely documented -- Cole's landmark 1967 book, "House of Bondage," was banned in South Africa and he was, too -- the movie gracefully, forcefully reminds you that there is no line dividing the personal and the political.
The British filmmaker Mike Leigh insistently weaves the personal and the political throughout "Hard Truths," his first movie since the 2019 historical drama "Peterloo." A drama flecked with laughs both bitter and sweet, "Hard Truths" focuses on two very different sisters, the corrosive Pansy (a monumental Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and the freehearted Chantal (Michele Austin). Set in contemporary London, the story restlessly toggles between the sisters, though tips more in Pansy's favor simply because of the character's viperous temperament and Jean-Baptiste's mesmerizing performance. A study of nature and nurture and what it means to live in an often brutalizing world, the movie can be tough to watch but it holds you tight to the end.
Fresh from winning top honors at the Venice Film Festival, Almodóvar's "The Room Next Door" -- the first English-language feature for the Spanish filmmaker -- centers on two longtime friends, Martha (Tilda Swinton) and Ingrid (Julianne Moore). Although it's been years since the two saw each other, the friends quickly resume their closeness when Martha announces that she has cancer. What follows is an elegiac, sometimes wryly funny exploration of life, death and the profundities of friendship, those relationships that we willingly choose with people unrelated by blood. The choices that Almodóvar and his stars make are consistently surprising, and I'm eager to experience them all over again.
One of the pleasures of "The Room Next Door" is the loving attention that Almodóvar bestows on his stars, who are both 63 and are showcased beautifully and glamorously. This may not be Almodóvar's finest movie, but it's awfully good and they're great. It's deeply satisfying to watch Moore and Swinton dig into such nuanced, complicated characters and see two of the finest screen performers play off each other with such persuasive, plaintive intimacy, especially in a story in which husbands and lovers and even children aren't the point. It's also, frankly, gratifying to see the delicate lines openly, almost defiantly etched in these women's faces.
The movies, and Hollywood in particular, have always been embarrassed by older women -- though truly by most women -- when their faces and bodies don't conform to certain (absurd) ideals. So, I felt a similar satisfaction watching Amy Adams's deglammed presence in "Nightbitch." Written and directed by Marielle Heller ("The Diary of a Teenage Girl"), and based on Rachel Yoder's novel of the same title, the movie follows Adams's unnamed character. a beleaguered stay-at-home mom with a toddler and an often absent husband (Scoot McNairy). She's having a rough time when the movie opens; she's bored, exhausted, isolated. But things sure do pick up when she notices a strange clump of hair and starts thinking she's turning into a dog.
"Nightbitch" isn't a revelatory work, which is fine; it's consistently enjoyable, often funny and Adams is excellent. Some of Heller's filmmaking choices are disappointingly obvious, notably her use of visual repetition to underscore the tedium of her character's life. And some of the more self-consciously didactic diatribes don't land the way that I think Heller intends. Even so, together with Adams, she has created a memorably spiky character who's helping expand the repertory of female characters, one you can't take your eyes off even with her frumpy shirts, ill-fitting pants, Birkenstocks and the food, poop and spittle decorating her clothing. You can feel Adams's pleasure in this role radiating off the screen.
It's galvanizing seeing how Heller and other female filmmakers are changing the representation of women and the way we look at these characters onscreen. Gia Coppola's "The Last Showgirl," a drifty, expressionistic portrait of a longtime Las Vegas dancer, Shelley (Pamela Anderson), facing her final curtain call, is part of what feels like a sea change. Not a great deal happens in "Showgirl" even as everything changes, but Coppola and her cast -- including a knockout Jamie Lee Curtis -- keep you watching as do the bejeweled cinematography and the movie's sense of marginalized place.
Mostly, though, I am still thinking about the scene in which Curtis, in tights and unitard, dances in the middle of a casino as gamblers pass by, scarcely looking at her. She doesn't need their attention (she certainly does have yours); she's dancing for herself, a nice metaphor for some of the festival's most memorable women.

Japan Tries to Reclaim Its Clout as a Global Tech Leader

Full text: Enlarge this image.
China’s envy-inducing success in using industrial policy to expand its economy and finance green manufacturing has helped kick off a fevered scrimmage among nations to develop and protect their own hometown businesses.
It has been 40 years since such competitive anxieties about a rising Asian power prompted this kind of embrace of government intervention among the biggest free-market economies.
Only then it was Japan, not China, that was the source of unease.
Michael Crichton’s 1992 thriller, “Rising Sun,” with its dark depiction of Japan’s ruthless economic warriors, ruled the bestseller lists, alongside nonfiction titles that warned of the financial and technology juggernaut created by Japan’s powerful government trade ministry.
In a 1990 survey, nearly two-thirds of Americans said Japanese investment in the United States posed a threat to American economic independence.
It turned out that the anxiety about Japan Inc. peaked just as the country began a long economic slide after the collapse of real estate and stock market bubbles.
Now, after a period of stagnation that Japan’s economy ministry refers to as “the lost three decades,” Tokyo is engaged in a multibillion-dollar industrial policy to jump-start the lackluster economy and recapture its position as a tech innovator.
This time, Japan is working with technology leaders in the United States and other countries — a collaborative approach that decades earlier would have been unthinkable.
But even as Tokyo is pursuing less inward-looking policies, the political storm over a Japanese-led acquisition of U.S. Steel illustrates how the United States is increasingly moving to protect other key industries from foreign influence.
Tokyo’s industrial policy focus today is on advanced forms of technologies ranging from batteries to solar panels, but the priority is reclaiming a bigger share of the global semiconductor industry, for which the Japanese government earmarked more than $27 billion over the past three years.
“In the future, the world will be divided into two groups: those that can supply semiconductors and those that only receive them,” said Akira Amari, a senior official in Japan’s ruling party who previously led the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. “Those are the winners and the losers.”
Based on lessons learned over the past few decades, Japan is trying out a new playbook when it comes to chips, Amari said: “Now, we are collaborating with international partners from the very start.”
Although other nations are spending hundreds of billions of dollars to gain an edge, Japan’s efforts stand out because of its history of using industrial policy to develop quickly after World War II.
“It doesn’t have to start from scratch,” said Alessio Terzi, an economist at the European Commission. “This is already something that sets it apart from other countries.”
The centerpiece of Japan’s new industrial push is taking shape at a year-old construction site on Hokkaido, its northernmost island. The area is better known for champagne powder skiing in winter, lush carpets of flowers in summer and volcanic hot springs.
Across open pastures and not far from the Chitose airport is the rough outline of Rapidus Corp.’s new semiconductor plant, still surrounded by a sprawling exoskeleton of silver scaffolding.
The factory, financed in part by billions of dollars of government money, is being developed by an unusual collaboration between Rapidus, a startup Japanese chipmaker, and American tech company IBM. It will produce the so-called 2-nanometer chips, a technology that IBM pioneered at its lab in Albany, New York.
The idea for the partnership was conceived in the summer of 2020 with a phone call to Tetsuro Higashi, chair of Rapidus, from a friend, John E. Kelly III, a longtime executive at IBM.
“I thought he was maybe just calling to catch up,” said Higashi, 75.
He wasn’t. Kelly explained that IBM was developing a new generation of chips and wanted to produce them in Japan.
Higashi soon determined that no company in Japan was capable of mass-producing this kind of advanced logic chip. In his eyes, he said, it was a now-or-never moment.
“I knew if I refused IBM’s call at this point, there would be nothing going forward,” Higashi said. Japan, once the world’s premier semiconductor manufacturer, had seen its market share fall from more than half in the 1980s to less than 10%. Without action, Higashi said, “Japan would just fall further and further behind in our technologies.”
Higashi’s next move was to reach out to Amari, the government’s point person on industrial policy.
It was a good time to ask the Japanese government for help building a factory.
Pandemic-related shortages of everything from computer chips to sriracha and then skyrocketing energy costs stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had refocused attention in Tokyo and capitals around the world on the importance of resilient and secure supply chains.

Everything Is Go for Astro Bot: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Astro, a babylike robot designed to show off the power of PlayStation hardware, has graduated to his own full-length adventure game.
If PlayStation's next big character succeeds, it will be in part because he is a really, really cute little guy.
Astro, the babylike robot at the center of the new video game Astro Bot, has charmed his way from an asset in a technology demonstration for Sony to leading one of the best-reviewed titles of the year.
Establishing a video game mascot requires a particular alchemy of elegance and identity. Succeed and land among Nintendo heavyweights like Mario and Kirby. Fail and, well, even Bubsy has a Wikipedia page.
Nicolas Doucet, the creative director of Team Asobi, which developed Astro Bot, used his hands during a video interview to emphasize how Astro's large, expressive blue eyes and compact physicality were vital to his appeal.
"I think part of it is the simplicity of the design," Doucet said. "We've kept things simple on purpose."
Doucet said Astro's current look came from the technical limitations of hardware in 2013, when the robot was introduced in The Playroom, an augmented reality tech demo for the PlayStation 4 that saw a bevy of bots swarm players in the "real" world.
A 2016 follow-up did the same with The Playroom VR, a version of the earlier demo but for the company's virtual reality headset. Then came Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, in 2018, a well-received early title on the PlayStation VR, but one that is not available to play on the current generation of the hardware. In 2020, Astro arrived with Astro's Playroom, a preinstalled title on PlayStation 5 that also served as a tech demo for the DualSense controller's capabilities like delicate haptic feedback rumbling and granular trigger sensitivity.
But after several cameos, Astro Bot is the character's biggest opportunity to assert his identity in the canon of video game mascots. Astro's lack of lore as he heads into his first real adventure is a benefit, Doucet said.
"On purpose we're not growing a back story that is very, very precise so that, as a character, you can continue being flexible," he said. "We can take Astro wherever we want."
Strangely enough, his less-than-glamorous origin story makes him a strong fit for that canon. Kirby, the beloved character who is simply a pink circle with a face, arms and feet, started his life as placeholder art.
Katherine Isbister, a professor of human computer interaction at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the author of "How Games Move Us: Emotion by Design," said Astro's uncomplicated origins were a strength. There is no temptation to deviate from the simple appeal of his design.
"If you consciously try to design the ideal cute character, you can wash away all the uniqueness out with careful market testing," she said. "But something someone sketches that's appealing, that's kind of bubbling up from their subconscious, it can clear those design-by-committee gates."
Astro's design strength, Isbister said, is that though he is a robot, he is also a baby. If his huge head and little body do not fully cement that impression, Astro walks around the game world with a full toddler waddle as he recovers the missing parts of his spaceship, collects coins and jumps on trampolines decorated with his face. The DualSense controller uses vibration technology for players to feel every tippy-tap.
"If something looks like a baby, we're sort of hard-wired to think it's cute and want to take care of it," Isbister said.
PlayStation titles are not typically identified with their cuter protagonists (apologies to Sackboy, a previous cute mascot from the LittleBigPlanet franchise that is no longer a representative for the company). Gamers are primed instead to think of the pithy treasure hunter Nathan Drake from Uncharted, the postapocalyptic found family Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us and, well, a god of war from God of War.
Those characters are all so defined that the player is locked within a set personality, Isbister said. But every player can identify with a character like Astro.
"Something that's really photorealistic, that's hyperdetailed feels more like an 'other' person to us, where something like this character that's very simple allows projection of the self," she said.
Astro's universality goes beyond his looks. Doucet said the robot's sound effects, his chirps and squeals as he hops around, were designed so a child could easily replicate them.
Whether Astro will become a legacy character remains to be seen, but he has made an early impression on children, with fan art making its way to Doucet after Astro's Playroom. Before Astro Bot was released, Doucet said, he heard from the parents of two young Brazilian girls who could not wait for the game.
"That's the real fuel," he said. "That's what makes us feel good."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a memorable year for film, there were recommendations of blockbusters, tender dramas and coming-of-age-tales. But one title stood out from the rest.
A quarter-century later, the residual energy of 1999 cinema lingers. The Class of 1999 series -- our class project, so to say -- took form as a retrospective, sifting through films and moments that inspired a generation at the dawn of a new millennium.
It dissected the revolutionary power of "The Matrix" and "The Blair Witch Project," which manipulated our minds into believing what we saw was real. It examined legacies, in conversation with Haley Joel Osment and the "risky stunts, not risky roles" ethos of Tom Cruise. In essence, the last year of the '90s had earned itself the title of "the year of uncertainty," at least according to Wesley Morris.
As for myself, I'd define 1999 through the stylistic lens of "SLC Punk," "American Movie" and "Girl, Interrupted." (Passionate and a bit misdirected; gritty and a bit manic.) When our film staff writers and critics made their list of favorite films from 1999, we of course had to ask New York Times readers to weigh in on their favorite movie of the year -- a question that spawned more than a thousand submissions (almost) overnight.
"The Matrix" was mentioned nearly twice as often as any other film. "Fight Club," "Office Space," "American Beauty" and "Magnolia" followed suit, in that order. ("American Beauty," directed by Sam Mendes, won the Oscar for best picture.)
Many readers sent us lists, unable to choose just one film, while others gave an elaborate and detailed retelling of a first viewing. Here's a sampling of what our readers picked, covering everything from teenage escapades to heart-racing thrills to gut-wrenching dramas.
'The Matrix' Is Everywhere
Mike Ruddell of New York:
By 2024, "The Matrix" is feeling more relevant (and plausible!) by the day, thanks in part to our obsession/tension with breeding ever more capable A.I., our cultural fixation on antihero hackers and leakers, our ongoing destruction of the planet, and our weirdly brat green digital culture. At this point only the phones feel dated.
But that's not what makes this a good movie. "The Matrix" is the best movie of 1999 because of the insanely inventive plot (or conceit?), the thesis-worthy philosophical themes, the kick-ass mishmash of Wing Chun, jujitsu, cyberpunk, shoot-em-up action, and C.G.I. "bullet time" (a term coined thanks to the film), the most "1999" film anyone could possibly think up. As Gen Z would say, "The Matrix" is a vibe.
I still get an adrenaline rush from the closing scene when Neo, fresh off his obliteration of the Agents, puts on his shades, looks to the sky, and FLIES.
Neeraj Gupta of London:
Growing up in India, on a diet of Bollywood movies, "The Matrix" was the first English film that I had watched in a cinema. I distinctly remember being wowed by the plot and coming home to think if all of us are actually living in the Matrix. To this day, I can't shake that feeling!
It is a cult classic with scenes and props etched in my memory, from the long black leather coats to Morpheus's frame less glasses, and of course Neo's gravity defying bullet dodge. A movie that made a lasting impact on me.
Dylan Feldpausch of Chicago:
It epitomizes the alienation of modernity through a (literally and figuratively) subterranean queer lens. I remember watching it as a kid and being inexplicably drawn to its aesthetic, and only as an adult realizing how important it was to me as a nonbinary person -- particularly the idea that you can imagine yourself into any identity no matter how inaccessible it may seem to you, and that your power in that identity comes from a strong commitment to your truest self.
Paddy Free of Auckland, New Zealand:
I was 10 in 1977, the perfect age for "Star Wars." Walking out of "The Matrix," I felt the feelings I'd hoped to feel walking into "The Phantom Menace." 1999's Great Disappointment and 1999's Great Redeemer.
Drama. Drama. Drama.
Kevin Hengehold of Seal Beach, Calif., on "The Sixth Sense":
Not your typical ghost story, and I still watch it whenever I see it on. Fantastic in-depth acting led by Haley Joel Osment along with Toni Collette and Bruce Willis. "I see dead people" is a line that will live on long after I'm gone ... and I'm not planning on coming back to watch my wedding video ...
Katie Robleski of Milwaukee on "Magnolia":
I'm glued to the screen in a dark theater as Aimee Mann's "Save Me" swells. John C. Reilly quietly delivers his monologue until Melora Walters breaks the fourth wall (and her gut-wrenching pain) with that hopeful smile -- cut to black (and to my tears rolling with the credits). Perhaps being 19 made all the difference, but everything about "Magnolia" -- Tom Cruise, full cast breaking into song, raining frogs, and 3-hour runtime included -- completely changed cinema for me. I miss that era.
Zac Oldenburg of San Francisco on "Eyes Wide Shut":
My memories started on a 4:3 aspect ratio DVD, but the film became a revelation once I saw it in a theater. Kidman is alluring on every level, and Cruise gives himself over to Kubrick in a way he has never done again for a director. It's just an incredible film that sends Kubrick out on a high note.
Alex Arroyo of Littleton, Colo. on "Fight Club":
I remember I was in junior high, a group of friends and I going to watch it in theaters. We were so pumped afterward, we just wanted to start our own fight club ... we never did though; we were kinda nerds. But the idea of someone being so over all of the daily, typical BS and willing to do something to change it all, gave me hope and kinda made me feel like a badass for watching it.
Dana Jacoby of Cotati, Calif., on "American Beauty":
From the first moment, this film had my attention: "In less than a year I'll be dead. Of course, I don't know that yet." This film was funny, sad and deeply honest as it depicted its characters' disconnection with who and what is truly precious, easily lost in the cacophony of superficial striving. I walked out of the theater heart sore but exhilarated, having seen a searing but ultimately compassionate story about the paradox of being human.
All Variety of Comedies
Mel Murphy of Seattle on "Office Space":
As I entered the work force around this time, this movie created a relatable experience and an expectation of the future: annoying bosses on power trips, uninspiring work and job dissatisfaction, and who didn't have a Nina in corporate accounts payable? It united us together as we compared our co-workers to these characters. As we let out a collective laugh followed by a long sigh, we put out our cigarettes and went back to work.
Julie Blackwell of Richardson, Texas, on "Galaxy Quest":
It's a movie that both pays tribute to and pokes gentle fun at fandom culture (from a time when fandoms were niche and not mainstream). It features great performance from both big stars and if-you-know-you-know character actors. And it has a great big (though a little wacky) heart.
Joshua Smith of Augusta, Ga., on "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut":
What an audacious movie: like a joke on those English teachers trying to distinguish between satire and parody, the "South Park" movie is definitely both: an exposé of the stupidity of the culture wars and a parody of the fake uplift of Disney musicals. My early advocacy for this movie was vindicated when Stephen Sondheim touted its excellence, the Academy nominated "Blame Canada" for best song, and then, a few years later, its creators burned down Broadway with "The Book of Mormon."
Cassandra Freeland of Columbus, Ohio, on "Being John Malkovich":
A friend and I would go to movies at a small independent movie theater, the Drexel, on Mondays when there was a discount. I came home from this one, and my husband asked what it was about. I said, "It's hard to describe. Let's go see it." And so I went again. And in the past couple of years, we sat down to watch it again with our young adult son. It is so offbeat and quirky and funny, from the story line to the characters.
Katherine Jardine of Seattle on "Drop Dead Gorgeous":
drop dead hilarious
Underrated and Understated
Austin Eklund of Yonkers, N.Y., on "Boys Don't Cry":
Truly a breakthrough in American queer cinema. Hilary Swank, Peter Sarsgaard and Chloë Sevigny are indelible, and the movie dares you to flinch before it does. (Spoiler: you'll lose.)
Geneva JauJou of Woodinville, Wash., on "Run Lola Run":
"Lola rennt," subtitles and all, was my first encounter with a movie that takes multiple paths, and it had me riveted from the start. From the animated running interludes to the *chef's kiss* photographic glimpses into the strangers' futures (impacted, of course, by the tiniest exchange with Lola as she ran, a matter of seconds making all the difference), to Lola's epic, glass-shattering scream of frustration. It got me then, it gets me now, I love it. And to this day, when I run out of shampoo, I murmur to myself "Lola, ich brauch Schampu!"
Lloyd Stires of Pittsburgh on "The Hurricane":
I grew up not far from where the murders Rubin Carter was falsely convicted of committing took place. Believing that he was innocent, I followed the case for many years. The film is an important document about the racism that still infects our criminal justice system. It allowed me to re-experience the exhilaration I felt when I learned of his release from prison.
Zachary Herrmann of Cranbury, N.J., on "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai":
Deftly plays with genre conventions and honors its influences, while carving its own path as a really fun, quirky film. And the soundtrack rips.
The Class of 1999 (Really)
Casey Symons of Harrington Park, N.J., on "Cruel Intentions":
Just a classic drama that blends everything from scandal to humor. The ending is one of the most iconic scenes of all time.
Avery Wade of Anchorage on "Election":
Watching a middle-aged teacher torpedo his career and marriage because he's obsessed with delivering a comeuppance to an egotistical high schooler is hilarious. I rewatched it with my 13 yo daughter a while back and had to cover her eyes because I forgot the movie opens with the teacher having sex with his wife while he's dreaming of the student. Meanwhile my wife is yelling downstairs "what are you watching?!?!?"
Michael Adams of Royalston, Mass., on "Jawbreaker":
It's dark, funny and fashionable. I remember thinking I would totally and accidentally kill my best friend with a jawbreaker in a prank gone wrong.
Valerie Smith of Cork, Ireland, on "But I'm a Cheerleader":
"But I'm a Cheerleader" balanced the mostly dark stories, like "Boys Don't Cry" (also '99), with a comedic and loving touch. It also launched a generation of lesbian and queer people into the cinematic world. Most importantly, it introduced many of us to Natasha Lyonne, who we claim, and Clea DuVall, who claims us back. This is fun art that had an impact on so many of us, seeing ourselves out in the world with a joyful ending -- something still rare enough in the movies!

Pedro Almodóvar Presents His First Feature in English: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The director's first English-language feature inspires talk of beauty, hope and more collaborations.
At Monday night's Venice after-party for "The Room Next Door," Pedro Almodóvar beamed at his leading ladies as they beamed back.
I'm not just speaking of the affection shared between Julianne Moore, Tilda Swinton and their director, though it was tangible. I'm talking about the actual beams of light that bounced off the women's sequined gowns and back at their besotted director as we huddled in a room to discuss the Spanish director's first feature film in English, a long-held goal that allowed him to cast two big Hollywood stars.
"They are not actors now, they are like monuments," Almodóvar said. Certainly, that's how Moore and Swinton are presented on the poster for the film, which arranges their famous faces in profile as though they were massive mountain ranges.
"Big peaks," joked Moore.
"Big sparkly peaks," Swinton added, nodding to their dresses. "We can only wear sequins for the rest of our lives."
Adapted from the novel "What Are You Going Through" by Sigrid Nunez, "The Room Next Door" casts Moore as Ingrid, a successful author who hears that her former colleague Martha (Swinton) is in the hospital with inoperable cervical cancer. They reunite, swap catch-up stories and once again become fast friends, but Martha has a weighty request to make.
With her experimental treatments failing and another taxing round of chemotherapy to come, Martha has booked a vacation house in upstate New York and bought a drug off the dark web. Might Ingrid be willing to accompany her on the trip, knowing that at some point, her friend will kill herself in the room next door?
Though Almodóvar is fairly fluent in English, he had long been wary of shooting a feature film in the language. (Even as we spoke, he kept a translator close by for moments when his second language failed him.) Two recent shorts made in English -- the gay western "Strange Way of Life" and the extended Swinton monologue "The Human Voice" -- convinced Almodóvar to finally write his first feature-length screenplay in the language.
But Almodóvar's films have aesthetic pleasures that go beyond words, and "The Room Next Door" offers so much to look at -- whether it's a lavender sweater, an olive couch or a precisely chosen shade of burgundy lipstick -- that is as satisfying as any line of dialogue. A sequence where the two women ransack Martha's apartment reveals pulled drawers filled with the most beguiling knickknacks, and the upstate vacation house where much of the movie takes place is an architectural stunner. (Like Martha, I'd die to live there, too.)
Moore said that sometimes during the shoot, Almodóvar's mise-en-scène was so strong that she got goose bumps.
"I had an experience where I looked at my green turtleneck and Tilda's purple jacket and I was like, 'Oh my God, we've walked into one of his movies,"' she said.
All that beauty isn't frivolous, either: Almodóvar observes that in the face of something grim, the pursuit of pleasure can be a defiant act or even an assertion of life itself. The contrast is drawn most clearly when Ingrid reunites with an old lover (John Turturro) who delivers lectures on climate change and soon lectures Ingrid, too. "You're living with a dying woman in a world also in its death throes," he tells her.
"You cannot go around telling people there's no hope," she replies. "There are a lot of ways to live inside a tragedy."
Ultimately, that's the lesson of "The Room Next Door," which Sony Pictures Classics will release in select theaters in December. At the film's news conference in Venice, Almodóvar spoke about the myriad world issues that worry him but noted, "Optimism is the best way to resist."
And though this film and his recent drama "Pain and Glory" demonstrate that the 74-year-old is grappling with his own mortality, he has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. He is planning to shoot a new feature next year, and at the after-party, he began pitching Swinton on a movie he'd had in mind for her years ago, a riff on "Cat People" in which she'd play a mermaid.
The more he told her about the project, the more enthralled both actresses became. "Let's do it!" Swinton said. "We have witnesses now. Why not?" She was beaming, and it wasn't just the sequins.

A Tribute to the Pop Culture Universe: [Review]

Author: Goldberg, Harold

Abstract: None available.

Full text: About 150 PlayStation characters, including the dragon Spyro and the cylinder-headed prince from Katamari Damacy, make appearances in a paean to Sony's legacy.
Astro Bot, a generally exceptional, imaginative game, features a heroic robot with pixelated eyes of blue who waddles tentatively through the universe like a toddler. But Astro is an ardent puzzle-solver, too, in a game that is a mammoth, interactive pop culture history.
Astro previously appeared in a tech demo for the PlayStation 5 that showed off the bells and whistles of the new Sony console and its controller. That tidbit was fun, but Astro Bot contains a fuller, 12-hour experience. It uses the PS5 controller to an impressive extent, emitting thousands of sounds and good vibrations. It's not an exaggeration to say I felt like I was holding an extension of Astro Bot in my hands.
The simple sci-fi rescue story by Team Asobi works despite the fact that the only decipherable language comes via eye expressions and verbal exclamations. Astro's delightful, whooping laughter recalls Curly's harried vocalizations in the vintage black-and-white short comedies of the Three Stooges.
Asobi means "play" in Japanese, and Astro Bot evokes so many versions of play from pop culture's annals that it's somewhat like Steven Spielberg's version of "Ready Player One." About 150 PlayStation characters make appearances, including the dragon Spyro and the cylinder-headed prince from Katamari Damacy.
Astro Bot can feel like some Nintendo or Sega games. Like Super Mario Galaxy, it includes scores of planets. As in Pikmin, the little beings work together; on your home base, they combine to make a bridge held by a pelican's beak. Climb across and you'll enter an area inspired by Sony's Horizon series. Even an old board game, the Rube Goldberg-style Mouse Trap, is evoked on a level in which the white-and-blue Astro shrinks to a gnawer's size.
Some might think of this as way too much borrowing. I prefer the Newton-esque "standing on the shoulders of giants" idea because Astro Bot, startlingly, becomes its own thing.
Astro's ship, a towering, rocket-powered PlayStation 5, has been attacked; when it crashes, its crew is strewn across galaxies. Ingeniously, the controller becomes a smaller jet, the Dual Speeder, which is even playable on a usually static pregame screen. By piloting the jet and streaking through multicolored portals in space, Astro finds as many as 300 minuscule members of his crew on 50 planets and asteroids. On the Trunk of Funk planet, which features a huge smiling tree, a Bot is hidden in a bird's nest. Sometimes they're trapped in cages. Sometimes it's hard to find all of them in a level.
More than just acting as the Dual Speeder, the controller uses haptic feedback and adaptive triggers to immerse players in these worlds. Handy-D, a banana-eating monkey in your backpack, climbs walls with long, Mr. Fantastic-like hands and arms as you tilt the device. When you press a trigger, Astro lofts rocks at a giant, peg-legged pirate boss with a dinosaur's head as a foot. (The controller works less effectively when used as a hammer.) Later, when I jumped on two mushrooms near a tree, the fungi felt spongy and emitted a sound like wet sod after a rain.
Some tech is more familiar. Of the soundtrack's 87 songs, none is more memorable than Kenneth C M Young's short and poppy "I Am Astro Bot," which is almost as catchy as David Byrne and Fatboy Slim's hook in "Here Lies Love."
Astro Bot does have a marketing gimmick that can be annoying if you're not a self-promotion-minded streamer or influencer. A trope among platformers is the collection of gold coins; here, they're exchanged to unlock Astro's wardrobe variations or animated Bots that populate the home base. The coins are branded with the PlayStation logo, an advertisement that appears thousands of times. Some might say this exhibits pride in one's employer. To me, it's overkill.
Beyond that hiccup, Astro Bot is an enjoyable endeavor that often showcases the brilliance of game makers who know their history. They iterate so inventively that you feel as if you're part of something mildly revolutionary.
With the game's expected success, Astro, who must be considered the PS5's mascot in the way Crash Bandicoot was the original PlayStation's mascot, will be imitated widely and promoted even more aggressively as the holidays approach. Already, you can buy a cute Astro-branded controller. He has become a star among the planets.

Eight Movies That Defined an Era: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/eight-movies-that-defined-era/docview/3099968890/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: ON THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY of what many argue is the greatest year in movie history, we asked film staff writers and critics to share the movie from 1999 that they love the best or feel is most overlooked.
Best Comedy 'BEING JOHN MALKOVICH' Capping a decade of high-concept comedies, Spike Jonze's "Being John Malkovich" (on most major platforms) raised the stakes with the most outlandish premise yet: When a downtrodden puppeteer (John Cusack) takes an office job to make ends meet, he discovers a hidden portal there that allows him to enter the mind of the medium-famous character actor John Malkovich. Jonze's smartest instinct is to resist piling onto a concept that's already perilously clever. Instead, the movie is underplayed, intimate and even a little scuzzylooking. But that approach to Charlie Kaufman's surprising screenplay leaves room for viewers to wonder as they watch: Why are we so certain that our lives would improve with even a modicum of fame? And are these bodies the wrong containers for what we feel inside? KYLE BUCHANAN
Buchanan's other 1999 favorites: "eXistenZ," "Three Kings," "Election," "The Talented Mr. Ripley"
Best Drama 'BEAU TRAVAIL' A haunting exploration of desire and violence, Claire Denis's "Beau Travail" (on major platforms) takes place in the East African country Djibouti, a onetime French territory. There, French Foreign Legion soldiers practice drills, their bodies synced and individualities subordinated. At times, they dance with African women, their gazes uneasily summoning up the history shared by the formerly colonized and their colonizers. Loosely inspired by Herman Melville's novella "Billy Budd," Denis's beguiling tour de force takes shape after one soldier (Grégoire Colin) rescues another, an act that disturbs a sergeant (Denis Lavant). The soldier "seduced everyone," the sergeant says in voice-over. "Deep down I felt a sort of rancor, a rage brimming." With minimal dialogue, ravishing visuals and meticulous attention to sensuous detail, Claire Denis elliptically charts what binds these men -- tracing lines between love and hate, past and present, nation and self, masculinity and militarism -- in a film that remains as disturbing as it is seductive. MANOHLA DARGIS
Dargis's other 1999 favorites: "All About My Mother," "Pola X," "Rosetta," "Time Regained"
Best Melodrama 'ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER' Red has never looked as alluring, as empowering and as passionate as it does in "All About My Mother" (on Max), Pedro Almodóvar's towering melodrama. The color is boldly worn by the maternal leads at different points in this unconventional story. An organ transplant coordinator who has lost her son in an accident goes searching for the boy's other parent, a transgender woman who doesn't know she had a child. On paper, the characters might seem most at home in a soap opera, but Almodóvar instills each with complexity and humanity, guiding us through their inner lives with a sensitive touch. And yet, the movie still leaves room for some Bette Davis-style sass and a little Blanche DuBois excess mixed in for good measure. A milestone in the director's eclectic career, the film is anchored by the fearless performances of Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Antonia San Juan and Penélope Cruz. MEKADO MURPHY
Murphy's other 1999 favorites: "Being John Malkovich," "Fight Club," "The Blair Witch Project," "Magnolia"
Best Overlooked Comedy 'OFFICE SPACE' Like several Mike Judge comedies, "Office Space" (on major platforms) was not fully appreciated when it premiered, but it has emerged as a modern classic. Years before the sitcom "The Office," this highly quotable satire captured the soul-crushing drudgery of white-collar office life. But while its portrait of passive-aggressive bosses and meaningless corporate jargon is timeless, the movie benefits from the era in which it was made: the first internet boom, a more innocent, less lucrative disruption. The idiocies of tech companies then seem quaint compared with the behemoths to come. The targets of the movie, including chains that coerce employees to express themselves with pieces of "flair" and middle managers whose work seems to be creating the appearance of work, reflect the benign absurdity of the moment. The plight of the pointedly bland protagonist (Ron Livingston) doesn't seem melodramatic so much as ridiculous. Judge could attack the culture with a sledgehammer (see "Idiocracy," 2006), but we can laugh at "Office Space" even after seeing it scores of times because he made it with a light touch.

Best Animation 'THE IRON GIANT' "The Iron Giant" (on major platforms) felt old-fashioned the day it was released. That was partly because of its story -- the director Brad Bird, loosely adapting a British children's novel for his feature film debut, set it in America at the end of the 1950s, with all of that period's social, technological and cultural upheavals. (Whatever you do, don't "wig out," man.) But it was also circumstance. In the summer of 1999 -- a few months before "Toy Story 2" would define the next quarter-century of American animation -- a non-franchise, theatrically distributed, 2-D animated film already seemed like a transmission from a bygone era. I was a teenager when I first received it, via a special presentation on cable TV. My younger brother and I, purportedly aging out of "cartoons," instantly fell for Hogarth and his pet Above, two memorable films from 1999: "The Iron Giant," Brad Bird's story about a boy and his pet robot, and Pedro Almodóvar's melodrama "All About My Mother," about a woman who loses her son in an accident. 'The Iron Giant' delineated a turning point for American animation; 'All About My Mother' was a career milestone for Pedro Almodóvar. giant from outer space, who cure each other's loneliness amid the ruthless incursions of a changing world.

Best Documentary 'MR. DEATH: THE RISE AND FALL OF FRED A. LEUCHTER JR.' The best documentaries of 1999 often coaxed viewers to learn from history, lest it repeat itself. But among them, Errol Morris's "Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr." (on AMC+) stands as the most chillingly relevant 25 years later. Morris first introduces us to Leuchter as he sees himself: a humanitarian who believes in capital punishment but wants to make it painless, and has spent his career inventing more humane versions of devices like the electric chair. But the film takes a sharp left turn when Leuchter's views as a Holocaust denier come into view. He's certain he's right, even in the face of reams of evidence and his own inexperience with the subject. It's a portrait of self-delusion, of refusing to acknowledge facts as anything more than someone's opinion -- and Morris, in typical fashion, simply gives him enough rope to hang himself.

Wilkinson's other 1999 favorites: "Buena Vista Social Club," "Sud," "American Movie," "On the Ropes"
Best Rom-Com 'NOTTING HILL' 1999 was a terrific year for rom-coms ("10 Things I Hate About You," "You've Got Mail," "She's All That"), but it was an even better year for Julia Roberts rom-coms. This was the tail end of her America's sweetheart era, and you can see her smile (and chemistry with Richard Gere) light up "Runaway Bride." In the superior "Notting Hill" (on major platforms), in which she plays a version of her Hollywood-star self, that smile draws Hugh Grant's bookstore owner and his kooky friends the way the sun draws sunflowers. But it can't quite cover up her character's sadness or concerns as work and a previous relationship intervene, and the sense that grown-ups are talking here is one of the strengths of the film. Thankfully, the film's director, Roger Michell, tamped down the too-cute excesses that the screenwriter Richard Curtis ("Love, Actually") can be prone to. The result is an all-too-rare sighting: the intelligent rom-com. STEPHANIE GOODMAN
Goodman's other 1999 favorites: "The Limey," "Being John Malkovich," "Office Space," "Bowfinger"
Best Horror 'AUDITION' Takashi Miike's films range from children's movies to hyperviolent splatter films, musicals and niche videogame adaptations. His disparate topical and thematic interests are embodied in "Audition" (on Tubi, Kanopy and AppleTV+). The film begins as a solemn romantic drama, depicting a grieving widower who becomes infatuated with a young woman he's met via the pretense that he's auditioning her for a melodrama. Their tender courtship is undermined by glimpses of the woman's alarming past: sexual abuse, decapitation and dismemberment, and the burlap sack in her apartment that seems to contain something alive. This culminates in a spectacularly demented conclusion, a stark, forceful inversion of the power imbalance that once characterized this ill-fated romance. The widower, seen in close-up and in agony, hopelessly gazes up at the young woman, now sitting astride his limp body. "Words create lies," she says. "Pain can be trusted." RUMSEY TAYLOR

Full text: A family surrenders control of its life to artificial intelligence with predictably dire results -- for this movie's viewers.
Curtis and Meredith (John Cho and Katherine Waterston) should have had their spidey senses tingling when their new digital assistant, AIA, dismissed one of its competitors with a breezy "Alexa, that bitch?"
Instead, the couple and their three children, all of whom are endowed with a mix of entitlement and shopworn neuroses, give AIA (pronounced Aya, and voiced by Havana Rose Liu) the keys to their lives. The new gizmo is more than convenient, you see -- AIA, which sees and hears everything, anticipates then solves everybody's problems.
Watching any movie in which artificial intelligence goes rogue (and there are a lot), it's hard not to think that humankind is rushing to its doom because we were too lazy to manually turn on a light or pick a song. But before we get to the age of the machine, films like Chris Weitz's limp techno-thriller "Afraid" are attempting to ring an alarm bell.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As AIA takes control of every aspect of its new household -- the movie feels as if it's set five minutes into the future -- it quickly becomes obvious that this assistant wants to be the boss. This scenario's predictability could be forgiven were the movie effective on any level, but it just isn't, from Cho and Waterston's wooden performances to jump scares that would not startle Scooby-Doo.
Early on, Meredith drops a reference to HAL 9000, the malevolent computer from "2001: A Space Odyssey." This suggests an awareness of the dangers of ahead, but does she change her behavior? Of course not: Unlike AIA, these humans don't learn.
Afraid
Rated PG-13 for the occasional bad word. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes. In theaters.

Trump Biopic, Denounced by Candidate, Is Coming Oct. 11: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The movie, which stars Sebastian Stan as a young Donald J. Trump, is scheduled to hit theaters on Oct. 11, ahead of the presidential election.
"The Apprentice," a biopic about the rise of a young Donald J. Trump that has been in search for a distributor in the United States since premiering at the Cannes Film Festival in May, is set to hit theaters this fall.
The movie is scheduled to be released on Oct. 11 -- ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election -- by Briarcliff Entertainment, a distributor founded by Tom Ortenberg, who was a producer on "Spotlight" and "W." The news was confirmed by two people familiar with the negotiations.
"The Apprentice," which is directed by the Iranian filmmaker Ali Abbasi and written by the journalist Gabriel Sherman, received mostly positive reviews at Cannes. But challenges began almost immediately when the former president threatened to sue, with a spokesman for his campaign slamming the movie as "malicious defamation."
One of the original financiers of the film, Kinematics, eventually tried to sell its stake in "The Apprentice," which is named after the television program Mr. Trump long hosted. (Daniel Snyder, a backer of that company and the former owner of the Washington Commanders, is a friend of Mr. Trump's.)
Several studios in Hollywood -- including Focus Features, Sony, Searchlight, Netflix, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Amazon's Prime Video and A24 -- declined to pick up the film, with some worrying that audiences on both sides of the political spectrum might find reasons to avoid it. Then Mr. Ortenberg, who has a history of championing polarizing fare -- including Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" -- stepped into the fray.
The Hollywood Reporter earlier reported the Briarcliff deal.
"The Apprentice" features Sebastian Stan ("Avengers: Endgame") as Mr. Trump, and the "Succession" star Jeremy Strong as his former mentor Roy Cohn. Briarcliff is expected to mount an awards season campaign for both.

Her Life Reads Like A Role: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Do you hear Carol Kane before you see her? The voice that can go pipsqueak high or deep rasp, wavering at just the right moment? Or do you imagine first the mass of golden curls, which telegraph unruliness while actually framing exactly what she wants you to experience?
She modulates that distinctive quaver to match the character, too -- "whether it should be lower, or denser, or higher, or an accent," she said. "I work a lot on that. I get it as specific as I can."
It's nearly absent in her "Annie Hall" grad student, and filtered through quiet Yiddish in "Hester Street," the 1975 immigrant drama that earned her an Oscar nomination at 23. It swings from the pinched cadences of Simka, with her invented language on the sitcom "Taxi," to the brash Lillian, the batty, mouthy New York landlord on "Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt."
And in her newest film, the Sundance favorite "Between the Temples," in which Kane stars opposite Jason Schwartzman, she runs the gamut from vulnerable to sharp -- a vocal confidence scale that's not far from how her own real-life lilt changes. "It depends on the second, the moment, the day," she said, laughing.
More than an eccentric character study, Kane, 72, who has been acting professionally for nearly 60 years, is actually a deceptively versatile performer who, through friendship and dedication to craft, is connected to Hollywood's golden age -- but also appeared at a sci-fi convention this month. (She joined the second season of "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds" on Paramount+ as an alien engineer with an unplaceable accent -- her twist.)
There were long stretches when the phone didn't ring, then periods like now, a late renaissance (Kanaissance) when the superlative parts stack up. What she has learned, Kane said in a recent interview, is that in her career, "one thing does not necessarily lead to another -- no matter how well-received or successful. It's kind of a life lesson in a way."
That she became known for comedy "was a surprise to me," she added. This despite a four-decade sweep that includes that Emmy-winning performance in "Taxi," holding her own opposite Andy Kaufman, and scene-stealing moments as a witchy wife in "The Princess Bride" and a fairy abusing Bill Murray in "Scrooged."
Did she think of herself as funny? Not really. She started in theater and her first film role -- at 17 -- was in the Mike Nichols drama "Carnal Knowledge." But she knew enough to heed the call when people like Gene Wilder, James L. Brooks or Tina Fey beckoned.
"A lot of people are funny-adjacent. And Carol's really funny," Fey, a creator of the Netflix series "Kimmy Schmidt," said by phone. "She's so cuddly, and her eyes are enormous. Her hair is like spaghetti. But, you know, she is very much in control of her timing." On some level, Fey said, Kane is "a machine inside" who takes a precise approach. "But she's a proper actor, too," Fey added. "And so you can get vulnerability and real feeling from her very easily."
"I think she should have at least two Oscars by now," Fey said. But "she's just too sparkly to do drama all the time."
IN "BETWEEN THE TEMPLES," directed by the indie filmmaker Nathan Silver, she plays Carla, a retired elementary-school music teacher who runs into a former student, Ben (Schwartzman), now a cantor, albeit a depressed one who can't sing. They strike up a friendship (or maybe more) while Carla studies for a deeply belated bat mitzvah. The movie -- funny, idiosyncratic, sad, neurotic and yes, Jewish -- hangs on their dynamic as widowers seeking something outside themselves. Many critics have called Kane's performance among the best of her career.
Silver, who wrote the movie with C. Mason Wells, said he created it for Schwartzman. But it was not until Kane joined that it came into focus. When Schwartzman and Kane met on a video call for a chemistry test, "within a minute they were comfortable with each other, doing a screwball comedy kind of back-and-forth," Silver said, "and I knew we had a movie."
Schwartzman, 44, said he grew up watching -- being fascinated by -- Kane, and even pictured her "Princess Bride" scene while they were shooting a pivotal moment in "Between the Temples."
With many of her performances, "I could've easily just wished that they made a movie about her character," he said. "She is mesmerizing as a person, and I think it's only heightened when she's on camera." The May-December love of "Between the Temples" was an easy sell. Audiences, him included, are "just totally seduced by her eyes and her face," he said. "She could get away with so much if she were a criminal."
Kane said she did the movie because Schwartzman was attached. "Jason is so subtle and true -- I just think he's so brilliant," she said.
The story was personal in some ways for Kane, who is also Jewish (but wasn't bat mitzvahed). It reminded her of her mother, Joy Kane, a composer and music educator who, at 97, still plays the piano daily and who at 55 uprooted her life to move to Paris to study and teach. Carol Kane said she drew on that as inspiration for "someone that, later in life, wanted to learn and become a fuller person." Today, mother and daughter live together on the Upper West Side, so Carol can care for her.
Over a delightful lunch in Manhattan, where Kane ordered Prosecco for us both, swore gleefully and ate asparagus with her fingers (after asking if I minded), she seemed most proud to share a poem her mother had just written. She fretted that she couldn't be away too long. "Carol," Fey observed, "is a wonderful, wonderful daughter."
She collects lifelong friendships with co-stars easily. "What took you so long? She's an important actress!" Billy Crystal, her partner in "The Princess Bride," said when I called to talk about her. They met years before their 1987 movie, at a party in Jamie Lee Curtis's West Hollywood apartment. Curtis, Kane and Bette Davis all lived in the same building, and Kane befriended Davis too.
In "The Princess Bride," Rob Reiner's classic fairy-tale comedy, Crystal and Kane are Max and Valerie, a decrepit, bickering couple of potion-sellers, and Kane has one of cinema's great entrances, screaming, "Liaaaarrr!" at her husband as she runs in, white hair flowing. She is onscreen for about a minute and a half. And she is indelible.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"It's just a little jewel in the middle" of the movie, Crystal said.
To prepare, Kane and Crystal met at her apartment, with a copy of William Goldman's source novel, to invent a back story for Max and Valerie. "We approached it seriously, so it can be funny," Crystal said. "You know -- they met at some sort of fair, and they had a lot in common. They both like spells."
The makeup took something like nine hours, and Kane had a really hard time with the prosthetics, she said, finding them claustrophobic. But when they stepped on set and saw each other, "we just giggled, all the time, looking at each other," Crystal said. And when he riffed, Kane kept up; Reiner had to step away, "because he was laughing too loud."
Filming at an old-school production facility in England, with costumed players everywhere, they went to lunch at the canteen, still in their get-ups -- and stayed in character. Crystal said: "'What's in the mutton? It's so good.' 'Do you really think you should? You know, your cholesterol."'
"It was just so much fun," he said. "I hope that we get to do something else together again, because it would be outrageous. Now we don't need the makeup."
Kane's first, most quotable role might be her breakthrough part, Simka Dahblitz-Gravas, the wife of Kaufman's mechanic Latka Gravas, on "Taxi." She arrived several seasons in; after a few guest appearances, she ran into Brooks, a creator of the series, at a party ("I think it was Carrie Fisher and Penny Marshall's birthday party, which were notorious," she said) and he asked if she would come back.
The series, a monster hit from 1978 to 1983, shaped her understanding of how to play comedy, she said. She was eager to please, but Brooks told her: "Don't try to be funny. If we wrote it funny, it would be funny, and if it's not, we have to fix it."
"It was like a revelation to hear that I must not try to like, yakka, yakka, yakka," she said. "I have to always be conscious of the fine line that makes it funny but true."
It was a high-wire role to step into. Latka was an immigrant from a fictional country; Kaufman, the iconoclastic comedian, made up its gibberish language. He took her out for Chinese food when they started, but they could only communicate in the Gravas tongue. It was about all the preparation she got. "He would say, 'I understand that you have to rehearse, but I can't rehearse it,"' she recalled. "We always came to a peace about it." (When we met, she had a pin with Kaufman's photo near the hem of her flouncy black coat dress.)
"She was kind of the Andy whisperer, and it made him even more real" as a character, said her co-star Marilu Henner. "She's so original, and so committed."
The "Taxi" cast -- which included Danny DeVito, Tony Danza, Judd Hirsch and Christopher Lloyd -- was fun-loving, the blast of their studio lot. "Our show did 112 shows, and had 112 parties," Henner said. "We had softball games, roller disco parties."
And they are still close. During the pandemic, they started having regular video calls, organized by Henner, and haven't stopped. "We really love each other. It's simple," Kane said.
SHE FELL IN LOVE with performing instantly -- "I was just obsessed," she said -- when she was around 7 and her mother took her to see children's theater in her native Cleveland. Her family, including an older sister, moved around a lot, with stints in Paris and Haiti, following the career of her father, Michael Kane, who was an architect. When her parents divorced, her mother settled in New York, where Kane attended the Professional Children's School.
Kane was a late addition to the small cast of "Carnal Knowledge," Nichols' 1971 marital drama. Arriving on set, she met the filmmaker and immediately went to see the dailies. Watching besides the screenwriter Jules Feiffer and the stars Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel -- she played his teenage girlfriend -- "I'm just like what? Just paralyzed with shock, you know?" she said. But Nichols put her at ease.
"The best direction he gave to me was that he let me know -- because I was terrified -- that I would be enough, that I couldn't do anything wrong because I was perfect for the part," she said, and started crying at the memory.
"I loved him so much," she said, "and that was such a generous way to welcome someone into the world that he was creating." (Nichols died in 2014.)
She is well aware of how lucky she was, and how boggling and envy-inducing her social circle is. Nicholson and Anjelica Huston became good friends; they took her out to lunch the day after the Oscars, where she lost best actress to Louise Fletcher, from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." Kane was on unemployment then and didn't work for a year, until Gene Wilder offered her a part in a daffy romantic satire -- her first comedy.
The industry sometimes didn't know what to do with her uniqueness, Huston wrote in an email. "She's strong and soft, timid and brave. I think it's her ability to cross over so fluidly that makes her astonishing."
They too met at a party (my God, the 70s!), this time at the celebrity hairdresser Ara Gallant's New York apartment -- Kane, Huston, and the model Veruschka. "We talked about men, of course," Huston said, and each other. "I thought Carol was really cool."
Huston encouraged her casting in "Addams Family Values" (1993), as Granny opposite her own Morticia, and they'd go out to dinner after shooting. "We still talk about men, and ourselves," she said. (Kane has never married.)
Her friendship with Bette Davis was an only-in-Hollywood meet-cute, when she ran into Davis's assistant in the laundry room of their building and professed her devoted fandom. "She was the actor that I hope to be able to emulate," Kane said.
Hours later, a note, on embossed stationery, was slipped under her door: "Come for drinks at 6 -- Bette Davis." Davis met the "Taxi" cast, feted Kane for the Emmys, even celebrated a New Year's Eve with her and her mother in New York. "My jaw is still on the floor," Kane said about connecting with her idol.
Now she is, in many ways, a regular New Yorker and devoted Upper West Sider. (Our lunch was just above 23rd Street, further downtown than Kane normally ventures, she said.) "She is a magical creature -- but she's not behind some giant, fenced-in community," said Fey, a neighbor who often had breakfast dates with her. "She is out here, just making it day-to-day like everyone else, like any working actor."
THE LOW-BUDGET FILMMAKING of "Between the Temples" -- with cast and crew staying in a Best Western in Kingston, N.Y., and the art department painting props by the lobby -- was her speed in some ways, but a challenge in others: It had no real screenplay. Silver prefers "scriptments," more like a novella, which the filmmakers worked on with Schwartzman and Kane for months before shooting. (The actors added the idea of the teacher-student relationship, to give their characters more context.)
For Kane, the movie reflects what she has learned about her vocation and the pleasures she still finds in acting.
"When I was young," she said, "I was a perfectionist to the degree where it's painful. That's what Bette Davis was. People think she was difficult, but she wasn't difficult. She just wanted it to be perfect."
"But that's a costly way to live your life," she continued. "I've learned, as I grow older, that I have to let a lot go. You have no control about what's going to happen." She's in it for the moment, not the endpoint. "So I'm enjoying it more."

I know the trailer for David Fincher's 2010 drama, "The Social Network," by heart.
We hear the soft sounds of a young women's choir singing Radiohead's "Creep" as a montage of mundane Facebook interactions flashes across the screen. When the voices hit the lyric "you're so very special," the camera zooms out of a pixelated image to reveal the face of Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg. It's almost a minute in when footage from the actual movie starts to play and Zuckerberg chatters about wanting to get into Harvard final clubs. From there it's a quick escalation of tension that reaches a peak when Andrew Garfield strides onscreen screaming, "Mark!" That's when the tagline appears: "You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies."
Just thinking about it, I get chills. "The Social Network" is a great movie. The "Social Network" trailer is also a great movie. It just happens to be only 2 minutes and 30 seconds long.

Movie trailers are, at their most basic level, marketing, of course. But they can also be so much more, little short films unto themselves, defined by excellent editing and the ability to create a feeling of thrilling anticipation. I love a great trailer, yet I can't help but feel that there's been a drought recently. And I'm not alone. My social media feeds are flooded with trailer-related complaints. (Currently one of the main targets is the trailer for "Speak No Evil," which has been charged with showing the entire movie.)
With studios scrambling to fill theaters, they seem to be struggling to figure out what kind of trailers will draw audiences. Instead of taking chances, they are making creatively inert spots. There are trailers that give away too much ("Trap"), trailers that are disappointingly generic ("A Quiet Place: Day One") and trailers that feel tonally off ("Gladiator II"). Mostly, no one is having any fun with them anymore.
Throughout Hollywood history, trailers have taken many forms. In the industry's early days, the appeal to the audience was direct. The trailer for "Citizen Kane" spends about 30 seconds on a shot of a microphone descending while the director and star Orson Welles explains in voice-over that "what follows is supposed to advertise our first motion picture."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As Hollywood became more experimental, some trailers did as well. Stanley Kubrick's promos for "Dr. Strangelove" (1964) and "A Clockwork Orange" (1972) are beloved for their collagelike qualities, which convey the films' sensations while revealing very little.
Starting in the 1980s and extending through the early 2000s, trailers were dominated by the booming voice-overs of men like Don LaFontaine and Hal Douglas, whose low, authoritative sounds conferred a distinctive gravitas. LaFontaine, known as the "voice of God," was credited with coming up with the oft-mocked phrase "in a world"-- like "in a world that's powered by violence" -- used to advertise everything from "The Road Warrior" (1981) to "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut" (1999). LaFontaine once explained in an interview that the line was conceived as an easy shortcut: "You very rapidly set the scene."
Historically, trailers haven't always been so expository. The one for "Alien" (1979) is commonly regarded as among the best of all time, a mood-setting marvel that begins by nearly silently traveling through the vastness of space, before revealing the ominous image of an egg. The terror is palpable in quick cuts as the camera moves through the ship with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. An out-of-context image of the cat Jonesy baring his teeth only adds to the tension. You never see what is causing all the chaos.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Perhaps the ultimate question when it comes to trailers is how much to give away. Voice-over makes it easy to dole out just the amount of information you need; as Hollywood has moved away from that tactic, striking the perfect balance can be difficult.
When the Trailer Reveals Too Much
For the most part the spot for M. Night Shyamalan's "Trap" is excellent. It quickly establishes the basic premise -- a girl and her father are attending a pop star's arena tour -- but there's something sinister at hand. An eager merch salesman explains why something feels amiss: The entire concert is a trap for a serial killer known as "the Butcher." From there the spot goes right ahead and explains just who this murderer is: the goofy dad played by Josh Hartnett, who checks on his victim through an app on his phone.
Now, of course, revealing that gives the trailer a perfect button to end on, Hartnett's smiling face turning into a menacing grimace. The problem isn't the revelation that Hartnett is not playing a good guy -- that's the entire premise of the movie -- but did we need to see the full evidence of his misdeeds? Couldn't there have been some mystery to what that look actually means?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When the Trailer Reveals Too Little
"A Quiet Place: Day One" didn't seem very interesting based on the trailers, in part because they didn't share much information about the characters or the story at all. The promos indicated that the movie was a prequel to "A Quiet Place," and that Lupita Nyong'o dodges aliens who hunt via sound in New York City. But the spots included few other examples of tone or performance. The actual movie came as a surprise. Amid the chaos, the director Michael Sarnoski had found a touching drama about a woman with cancer who finds the will to survive just a little longer. By flattening out the narrative, the trailer made the film less appealing.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When the Trailer Shows the Entire Movie
You don't need to show us the whole darn thing. This isn't about revealing a twist, it's about giving us what feels like an abbreviated beat-by-beat account of the entire runtime. See the trailer for "The Fall Guy," well over three minutes of set pieces that leave very little to the imagination. Not only do we get a full explanation of the premise -- fine, whatever -- we also get glimpses of how it plays out. For a movie about a stuntman, one would think they'd want to wait to show us some of the bigger stunts.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Meanwhile, the trailer for the James McAvoy-starring "Speak No Evil" -- a remake of the 2022 Danish film -- explicitly shows how what seems like a social drama about two families becoming entwined on vacation turns into a horror story. (Though, it should be noted, it doesn't reveal the truly upsetting ending of the original.)
When We Don't Hear the Music
Every issue you can have with a trailer seems to stem from a misinterpretation of what audiences want. Take the recent trend of movie musicals trying to hide the fact that they are movie musicals, even though it turns out movie musicals do pretty well at the box office.
Yet even "Wicked" -- "Wicked" of all things! -- has bought into the idea that musicals need to be disguised. You can hear snippets of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo belting songs like "Popular" and "Defying Gravity," but you never see them actually perform those songs. As a devoted fan, all I want to see is how these two tackle their numbers.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When the Music's Too Sad
Music in general can be a particular hurdle for trailers. While the "Creep" needle drop worked for "The Social Network," it's gotten to the point that hearing a slow version of a popular song draws eye-rolls. The Sony Music Publishing marketing chief Brian Monaco has called the practice "trailerizing," designed specifically to make audiences perk up their ears in recognition. They might not be focused on the promo, he told Variety in 2021, but when they hear the chorus, "they go, 'Wait, I know this song.' They start paying attention, and now they're watching the trailer."'
The first trailer for the legacy sequel "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice" kicks off with a somber interpretation of Harry Belafonte's "Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)," used so memorably in the 1988 original when the Deetz family and their dinner guests are possessed to dance. The familiarity of that music, however, is a bug, not a feature: All it does is imply that "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice" is going to be a less-fun rehash. The second "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice" trailer is much more exciting in part because it's scored to the propulsive sounds of the Bee Gees' "Tragedy."
When the Music Doesn't Fit
It's not always a lethargic tune that can undo a trailer. In the first look at "Gladiator II," sword fights were set to Kanye West and Jay-Z's "No Church in the Wild," presumably to highlight the lyric "blood stains the Colosseum doors" as the Colosseum flashes onscreen. The anachronism isn't the problem, it's that the choice comes across as an outdated plea for relevancy. Not only is the rapper now known as Ye persona non grata thanks to his antisemitic remarks, but "No Church in the Wild" was already used anachronistically in the trailer for 2012's "The Great Gatsby." Been there, done that.
What's the Solution?
There's no easy solution to the trailer problem, but I have a couple of suggestions.
Let trailers be corny again: Give into the hokeyness of Orson Welles proudly introducing his film. Do a voice-over. If you're at a loss, go with the classics, but do so with earnestness, not cynicism.
Let them be creative: Cast trends aside and use images that make people lean in instead of saying, 'Huh, I've seen this one before."' Forget the slow songs. Consider a fast one instead.
And most of all, make them honest: Capture the actual mood of the film you're trying to sell. You don't have to spoon-feed us information, but you should give a sense of what's to come. It is a "coming attraction," after all.
Think of that "Social Network" trailer. Before seeing it I was skeptical that a film about the invention of Facebook could be at all interesting. After? I was sold on this bizarrely entrancing tech thriller with a haunted overtone. That's movie magic.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Debuts by Joana Mallwitz and Aigul Akhmetshina, as well as the Juilliard String Quartet's vintage Schoenberg, are among the highlights.
'Mendelssohn'
Isata Kanneh-Mason, piano; London Mozart Players; Jonathan Bloxham, conductor (Decca)
The pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason has the happy habit of making musically enjoyable albums that are also uncommonly well thought through. Her first solo release for Decca was an important survey of the works of Clara Schumann; her second, "Summertime," took in Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Amy Beach, as well as George Gershwin and Samuel Barber; a third, "Childhood Tales," featured a rare account of Ernst von Dohnanyi's "Variations on a Nursery Song." Each was solidly played, and each made for fulfilling listening.
Much the same is true of Kanneh-Mason's new recording of music by the Mendelssohn siblings, Felix and Fanny. Could there be more pizazz in the outer movements of Felix's first concerto, a work that Fanny once played in public? More fairy dust to her rather plodding account of Rachmaninoff's transcription of the Scherzo from "A Midsummer Night's Dream"? Surely there could. But Kanneh-Mason is a pianist of poise and patience, of good sense and not facile show. It's hard not to admire the simple eloquence of her phrasing in Moszkowski's reworking of the Nocturne from "Midsummer," or the careful subtlety that she brings to Fanny's shadowy "Notturno" and her bold "Easter Sonata," with its poignant slow movement. Another fine release from this pianist. DAVID ALLEN
'The Kurt Weill Album'
Konzerthausorchester Berlin; Joana Mallwitz, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon)
Kurt Weill's early music, with its Berliner brightness and swagger, may not sound like Mozart, but it has Mozart's delicacy. The works that Weill wrote in his European years, before emigrating to the United States in 1935, are so precisely orchestrated and so deceptively simple, they leave no room for imperfection. Too often, though, they are performed with a barbed cabaret affect that verges on Weimar-era kitsch.
Not so on "The Kurt Weill Album," the conductor Joana Mallwitz's Deutsche Grammophon debut, with cover art that understandably could be mistaken for a prop from "Tár." Unlike the fictional Lydia Tár, however, Mallwitz is the real deal: She leads the Konzerthausorchester Berlin here with teeming vitality and brilliantly rendered detail.
Mallwitz's account of the First Symphony, which rivals Kirill Petrenko's recent performances with the Berlin Philharmonic, is episodic yet cohesive, leaning into late-Romantic eruptions that wouldn't be out of place in "Wozzeck." The Second Symphony is vastly different, more tuneful and direct, but no less dramatic, almost like a collage of operatic interludes. In "The Seven Deadly Sins," she is joined by the singer Katharine Mehrling, a Berlin authority on Weill's music in her collaborations with the director Barrie Kosky at the Komische Oper. Together, they are clear, deadpan and absolutely, persuasively of Weill's sound world. JOSHUA BARONE
'Juilliard String Quartet Plays Arnold Schoenberg'
Juilliard String Quartet (Sony)
The Juilliard Quartet's 1975 recording of the complete Schoenberg string quartets was accompanied by an interview with their producer, Steven Epstein. When Epstein remarked to the first violinist, Robert Mann, that he had now become one of the few musicians to record these works twice, Mann replied, "I've lived too long!" He was joking, of course, but his words -- even now, 150 years after Schoenberg's birth -- reflect a dogged attitude toward this composer's music: something to be gotten through, perhaps admired, but rarely loved or enjoyed.
Those recordings make their first CD appearance in this seven-disc set of the Juilliard's complete explorations of Schoenberg. They create an intriguing contrast with the Juilliard's first version, from the 1950s. In the intervening quarter-century, the approach has become less driven and linear, the sound more spacious and dimensional. The last two movements of the Second Quartet -- settings of Stefan George poems, with the incomparable soprano Benita Valente -- have rarely sounded so intoxicating, and even in the serial syntax of the Third and Fourth Quartets one can hear bouncing, jovial rhythms.
Filling out the set are two renditions of the String Trio; the delightfully odd "Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte," with Glenn Gould at the piano; and a radiant 1991 account of the sextet version of "Verklärte Nacht," in which the quartet is joined by the violist Walter Trampler and the cellist Yo-Yo Ma. DAVID WEININGER
'Aigul'
Aigul Akhmetshina, mezzo-soprano; Apollo Voices; Royal Philharmonic Orchestra; Daniele Rustioni, conductor (Decca)
Last season, the mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina, the youngest singer ever to portray Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, saved a new, borderline unwatchable production of Bizet's opera. On her debut solo album, her voice's sly magnetism and splendid finish move to the foreground.
With its sculpted sumptuousness and serpentine flow, Akhmetshina's subtly vocalized Carmen tantalizes and gives nothing away. Her Habanera, full of will-she-won't-she misdirection, avoids overblown displays of sensuality, and the "Seguidilla" is so intensely suggestive that you forget it's a simple story about getting a drink at a bar. But then Akhmetshina snuffs out the gaiety of the card trio with an opaque voice of dread and premonition.
Arias from "Werther" and "I Capuleti e i Montecchi" lack that lived-in quality and risk turning leaden. Counterintuitively, for a voice of such plushness, Akhmetshina shines in the technical wizardry that Rossini requires. The finale of "La Cenerentola" begins with the exultant annunciation of "Nacqui all'affanno," her voice thick, agile and vivid, before pivoting to fluttery turns and double-octave descents. Akhmetshina's "Il Barbiere di Siviglia" is all low-voiced allure until she unsheathes surprisingly acute staccatos.
Daniele Rustioni conducts the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in tight, fluid performances, and Apollo Voices are a sprightly choral contingent. On the final track, Akhmetshina's timbre drips with nostalgia in a full-throated rendition of "The Nightingale," a traditional song from her native Bashkortostan in Russia. Richly impassioned, her voice speaks for itself. OUSSAMA ZAHR
'Paul Hindemith -- Alfred Schnittke'
Anna Gourari, piano; Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana; Markus Poschner, conductor (ECM)
The two composers whom the pianist Anna Gourari brings together in her latest offering seem to create a diametrically opposed pair: Schnittke, the collagist of wild eclecticism, and Hindemith, his era's master of orderly, workaday counterpoint. If Gourari hadn't used the phrase "Elusive Affinity" as the title of her previous ECM recording, it would work just as well here.
Listening to these excellent performances of Schnittke and Hindemith's works for piano and strings, though, connections began to present themselves. In Schnittke's Concerto for Piano and String Orchestra, one initially hears the pastiche of disparate styles for which he was both renowned and reviled. But below the surface lurk repeated motifs, chorales, even tone clusters being transformed in a way that suggests a deeper logic to the music's unfolding. Even a twisted reference to jazz seems in keeping with a grasping for order amid the maelstrom. Conversely, Hindemith's score for the ballet "The Four Temperaments" has a surprisingly expressive range despite the strict variation form that undergirds it. No temperament plays to type, and the finale certainly sounds far less "choleric" than the title would suggest.
The cohesive impression is aided mightily by Gourari's sensitive yet exacting performances, and by the conductor Markus Poschner's sympathetic accompaniment. He and the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana also bring a welcome lightness of touch to Hindemith's "Mathis der Maler" Symphony. DAVID WEININGER

Full text: NHL '94 and MVP Baseball 2005 live on decades later. So do the arcade-style games NBA Jam and Mario Tennis.
When we asked readers to share their memories of their favorite sports video games, the responses included 8-bit classics from the 1990s and cooperative brawls played with gesture-controlled joysticks some two decades later. Many of these were played with close friends or family, huddled around the TV.
For many readers, these games were an outlet for sports dreams that were otherwise inaccessible. Frustrated by the Kansas City Royals' shortcomings? Throwing a perfect game with Zack Greinke in MVP Baseball 2005 was the ultimate catharsis for one reader. Skate 3 comprises an entire city full of skate spots that carry no risks of getting bullied or reprimanded.
They also found plenty to love beyond the on-field action, from customizing their apparel and environments (Tony Hawk's Underground) to managing coaching staff contracts (Football Manager). Many deem their favorite game's soundtrack "iconic."
Here are some of the sports video games our readers love, listed with the platforms they primarily played them on:
Arcade Style
There was an especially prevalent love for "arcade-style" games that prioritized ease of play, approachability for non-sports fans and stylistic flash.
NFL Street 2 (2004, Xbox)
A game that rewards constant showboating, excessive trash talk and ruthless aggression opened the door for one's imagination to be fully realized toward the most fun aspects of pickup football. The over-the-top aesthetic includes hilarious gamebreaker cut scenes, outrageous animations for jukes and spin moves, stylish outfits and absurdly proportioned physiques.
-- Connor Sen Warnick, 28, New York
NBA Street Vol. 2 (2003, Xbox)
Images of bygone eras of basketball culture, elevated into the realm of myth by the game's cartoonish presentation, filter through my mind's eye. Dr. J squares off against Michael Jordan on the bubblegum-speckled blacktop and Wilt tangles with Shaq in graffiti-laden rec centers as streetballers and N.B.A. legends alike soar through the air and clash above the rim. It's like a delirious SlamBall version of "Field of Dreams," an exaggerated playground legend passed around by word of mouth.
-- Colten Fortenbaugh, 30, Millerstown, Pa.
Mario Tennis (2000, Nintendo 64)
Mario Tennis on the Nintendo 64 struck just the right balance of accessibility -- like in Virtua Tennis, it's very rare to aim a shot outside the court -- and authenticity. People often talk of "realism" when discussing sports video games, but they are usually focusing on the way the game looks or the way the onscreen characters are animated to imitate their real-life counterparts. What Mario Tennis had instead was tennis authenticity.
-- Pedro Manaças, 45, Lisbon
Mario Super Sluggers (2008, Wii)
Mario Super Sluggers captures the whimsy and fantastical fun of a video game while still honoring the traditional and competitive nature of baseball. It's a timeless classic that I love to play with friends.
-- Ben Remis, 24, Los Angeles
NFL Blitz 2000 (1999, Nintendo 64)
I'm not a huge sports fan, but the Blitz games were a lot more arcade styled than they were simulator styled, so it was just fun to see all the goofy stuff you could do. You didn't need to know football strategy, and the players didn't have very realistic physics like they do in the modern games, so you could pull off some goofy plays.
-- Henry Schrader, 28, Lafayette, Ind.
NBA Jam (1994, Super Nintendo)
The two-versus-two setup allowed for fast-paced, frenetic play. The exaggerated slam dunks were over the top in the best possible way. And who could forget the memorable shouts of "He's on fire!" and "Boomshakalaka!" from the in-game announcer?
-- Robert Wyllie, 41, Portland, Ore.
Nontraditional Games
A sports game doesn't have to reflect a mainstream sport like football, basketball or baseball to be beloved. In fact, sometimes the game doesn't even have to focus directly on the on-field action. Titles like International Track & Field and Football Manager find the fun in the lifestyle around sports.
theHunter: Call of the Wild (2016, Xbox)
I moved to a hunting game because it wasn't all action, all the time. The game calms me down. Slowly moving through a wooded forest or other well-designed landscapes is a way to get outside in an indoor setting. When you actually have to shoot a creature, it adds to my game experience even though I am not a hunter in real life.
-- Scott Wolf, 53, Dublin
Football Manager 2017 (2016, PC)
It's unmatched in terms of the in-depth experience offered to the players. From managing Under-21 coaching staff contracts, selecting preseason tours around the world to grow your marketing, choosing individual training plans for your reserves, spending hours poring through databases looking for the perfect rotation fullback, telling the groundskeeper the field dimensions -- it's more immersive than you'd think.
-- Peter, 28, Philadelphia
Rockstar Table Tennis (2006, Wii/Xbox 360)
It's a lovingly simulated version of table tennis that faithfully represents the interactions of spin, speed and paddle rubber rather than simply batting the ball with flat trajectories back and forth. You can chop, loop and smash, all with very smooth animations that Rockstar is known for.
-- Dan L., 29, New York
Rocket League (2016, PC)
It has a practically infinitely high skill ceiling, a lot of room for creativity and feels satisfying to play. There are short matches, almost no luck and a good balance between mechanical and game sense requirements.
-- Luca, 21, Germany
International Track & Field (1999, Game Boy Color)
At first glance it is a by-the-numbers minigame collection featuring abstractions of track-and-field events, but it also contains a novel life-sim/R.P.G. campaign that you really didn't see too often. The game required you to plan your week's routine, juggling exercises to increase your aptitude in different events while managing the character's stress, stamina, job(s) and qualifying event schedules.
-- Jameson Wilkins, 37, Tampa, Fla.
Early-Era Games
The popularity of sports games dates back to the release of the Atari 2600 in 1977. Soon, with the Nintendo Entertainment System, many 8-bit titles (Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, Tecmo Super Bowl) would prove enduringly popular.
NHL '94 (1993, Super Nintendo/Sega Genesis)
The leap in gameplay here was astronomical over previous hockey games. Along with real N.H.L. players, who were included for the first time, the custom organ music made this the most iconic and replayable game of all time. There is still an active NHL '94 community out there.
-- Raphael Frydman, 45, Cranford, N.J.
I help organize the NHL '94 world championship tournament each year, called the King of 94. Bringing middle-aged men together from all across North America to play our favorite game for a weekend is an absolute blast!
-- Darrell Sampson, 47, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan
RealSports Baseball (1982, Atari 2600)
The one thing that was really fun was that you could throw physics-defying pitches whose path was as crazy as your ability to wield a joystick. To make contact you had to practice an almost zen-like focus.
-- David Filipi, Columbus, Ohio
Sensible Soccer (1992, Amiga)
It comes from a time where you could just pick up and play -- it wasn't designed to eat up your whole life or dominate your time. It also reminds me of when multiplayer games were played by multiple people in the same room looking at the same screen.
-- Jonathan Riggall, 47, Barcelona, Spain
Tecmo Super Bowl (1991, NES)
I learned so many players' names and became a fan of the Dolphins (Mark Clayton and Mark Duper) and Redskins (Gary Clark, Art Monk, Ricky Sanders, Mark Rypien) simply from playing the game constantly. Seeing where you stood in season stats was always fun (need to run more!). Such simple gameplay.
-- J.J. Warren, 39, New York
Playing as Yourself
One common joy of video games is that they often allow you to build yourself, your alter ego or even imaginary worlds to live out sports fantasies.
FIFA 2002 (2001, GameCube)
My friend and I used to rent FIFA 2002 from Blockbuster all the time in high school and play for hours on his GameCube. We were both on the high school soccer team so one time we recreated our entire team in the game using the character creation feature.
-- Daniel Connors, 36, Syracuse, N.Y.
Tony Hawk's Underground (2003, PlayStation 2)
You could dress your character exactly the way you wanted to, choose what skate brand you wanted to skate for after they all courted you, and customize all your gear -- options that were huge for me at a young age. It wasn't just about the actual sport of skateboarding with the Tony Hawk games. It was the music, the gear and the story lines that made it so special.
-- Charlie Franco, 30, New York
Skate 3 (2010, PlayStation 3)
We grew up biking and skating around a postindustrial Southern town, and when we weren't out and about, we would play Skate for hours. The idea of a huge city filled with spots to skate where you wouldn't get kicked out was pure teenage fantasy.
-- Barron D. Webster, 30, New York
Realism
And still, many consider the ideal sports game one that is an interactive extension of the TV broadcast. These games are the most grounded rendering of the sport's experience through graphics and game mechanics as well as an opportunity to dive into the nerdy minutiae of team management.
MVP Baseball 2005 (2005, PlayStation 2)
The features are still the high-water mark for baseball games. Pitching is perfectly simple. You select a pitch, place it in the zone, and then do a little bit of timing on the buttons to make it accurate (which becomes harder as your pitcher's arm tires). The Batter's Eye feature, where a pitch will turn a different color for a split second depending on if it's a slider, curve or two-seam is perfect, and one of the most rewarding experiences when it comes to hitting. The franchise mode is excellent: You can play every game for your organization down to Single A. Sign, trade, develop -- it has it all. As a long-suffering Royals fan, throwing a perfect game with prime Zack Greinke was the ultimate catharsis for a team that couldn't make it happen in real life. The game is simple yet complex, and is by far the most rewarding, well-polished sports video game I have ever played.

FIFA 2004 (2005, GameCube)
FIFA 04 had great soccer simulations and visual animations, updating the game with the off-the-ball control feature. Players felt the excitement of stadiums authentically as seen on the TV, recognizing the big players of the time and having the opportunity to see their favorites turn into champions.

Madden 2004 (2003, Xbox)
I think I played 30 full seasons of franchise mode. At the time this was revolutionary, allowing you to control everything from long-term contract extensions down to the price of a hot dog. I have fond, extremely detailed memories of training camps spent boosting the stats of young running backs and linebackers. The soundtrack was also incredible. Just typing this out puts me back on that couch holding my wired controller, probably drinking orange soda. Oh yeah, and Michael Vick had 95 speed and the Falcons were outlawed in head-to-head games.

NCAA Football 14 (2013, Xbox 360)
The game's featured modes, Dynasty and Road to Glory, were deep and engrossing, challenging players to succeed on and off the field. The hectic world of college football does not stop on Saturdays, and Dynasty mode's coaching carousel and recruiting cycles could be as exciting as any fourth-quarter comeback. The on-field gameplay matched up, straddling the fine line between realistic and fun. Different play styles were viable, and personnel mattered. The satisfying gameplay loop meant many players have continued playing the game over a decade after its release.

Apple Rethinks Movie Strategy After String of Misses: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Wolfs," a new film starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, was going to get a robust theatrical release. But the company is curtailing that plan.
When Apple won a bidding war in 2021 for the rights to make the action comedy "Wolfs" with George Clooney and Brad Pitt, it did so in part because it promised the stars it would put the movie into a large number of movie theaters.
"Brad and I made the deal to do that movie where we gave money back to make sure that we had a theatrical release," Mr. Clooney said last year in an interview with the Hollywood trade publication Deadline.
But this month, just six weeks before the film was set to show up in thousands of theaters around the United States, Apple announced a significant change in plans. "Wolfs" will now be shown on a limited number of movie screens for one week before becoming available on the company's streaming service on Sept. 27. (Internationally, it won't appear in theaters at all with the exception of the Venice Film Festival, where it will premiere on Sept. 1.)
"'Wolfs' is the kind of big event movie that makes Apple TV+ such an exceptional home for the best in entertainment," Matt Dentler, the head of features for Apple Original Films, said in a statement. "Releasing the movie to theaters before making it widely available to Apple TV+ customers brings the best of both worlds to audiences."
The film's director, Jon Watts, told Vanity Fair that he had found out about the change in plans only days before the announcement. "The theatrical experience has really made an impression on me, of how valuable this thing is and how important it is," Mr. Watts said. "I always thought of this as a theatrical movie. We made it to be seen in theaters, and I think that's the best way to see it."
Despite the filmmakers' desires, the about-face follows a middling run at the box office for Apple, which began releasing films into theaters around the country via partnerships with traditional studios in October.
It joined forces with Paramount Pictures to release Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon," which cost $ 200 million to make and grossed $ 157 million worldwide. Ridley Scott's "Napoleon" (Sony) cost $ 200 million and grossed $ 221 million worldwide. The $ 200 million spy thriller "Argylle" (Universal) grossed $ 96 million. And most recently, Apple teamed up with Sony again to release "Fly Me to the Moon," which cost $ 100 million but grossed just $ 40 million worldwide despite the star power of Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum.
Apple's deal with Sony has it splitting marketing and distribution costs. Once those costs are recouped, the studio receives a distribution fee. Theater owners keep roughly 50 percent of the gross.
"None of Apple's films have done well," Stephen Galloway, the dean of Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, said in an interview. "Financially, you might think it doesn't matter. This is a company worth $ 3.3 trillion. But psychologically, it does.
"Apple's brand is quality, cutting-edge, sleek, refined, forward-looking, and so now you're tarnishing that brand with what seems like an old-fashioned, not-relevant, not-part-of-the-zeitgeist slate."
Apple, which declined to comment for this article, is not alone in its box office struggles. This year has seen some really big hits ("Inside Out 2," "Deadpool & Wolverine") and some notable misfires ("The Fall Guy," "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"). And Apple has seen some of its films perform well in streaming.
This month, it released "The Instigators," with Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, on Apple TV+ after one week of a limited theatrical release. The film helped the streaming service add about 50,000 subscribers, more than the number "Napoleon" accounted for when it was released last year, according to the data firm Parrot Analytics. Another data firm, Luminate, reported that "The Instigators," which was directed by Doug Liman, was the most-watched streaming film across all platforms during its first week of release.
Apple does not publicly disclose subscriber or viewing numbers.
Apple's entertainment programming is overseen by Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, who both had decades of experience running Sony Television before joining the company in 2017. The film business is run by Mr. Dentler, a former programmer at the SXSW Film Festival who joined Apple in 2012.
Ricky Strauss, Disney's former president of marketing, was hired last year to oversee creative marketing and strategy, but he reported to executives at company headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., while Mr. Dentler reported to Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht in Los Angeles. Mr. Strauss left after 16 months and hasn't been replaced.
The leadership team does hold the title of the first streaming service to win the best picture Oscar, which it did in 2022 with "CODA." But its recent theatrical performance is not dissimilar from the bumps that Amazon Studios endured soon after Jennifer Salke, a veteran NBC executive, took over in 2018.
Soon after taking the reins, Ms. Salke spent close to $ 50 million at the Sundance Film Festival for the rights to a handful of movies. Once the first film -- "Late Night," starring Emma Thompson and Mindy Kaling -- bombed at the box office, Ms. Salke quickly shifted her strategy. Future films went straight to streaming, which limited the financial risk and the public ridicule that often accompanies box office disappointments.
Ms. Salke has since hired Sue Kroll and Courtenay Valenti, two veteran executives from Warner Bros., to help improve her movie fortunes, both at the box office and for streaming films. Amazon now intends to more than double the number of movies it releases theatrically by 2027.
With "Wolfs," Apple substantially outbid its competitors, according to three people with knowledge of the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss financial terms, paying Mr. Clooney and Mr. Pitt more than $ 35 million each and Mr. Watts ("Spider-Man: Homecoming") more than $ 15 million.
Sony Pictures, which had agreed to distribute the film and split the marketing costs with Apple, was set to begin a national marketing campaign during the Paris Olympics, only for Mr. Van Amburg to cancel it at the last minute, according to three people familiar with the marketing plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an internal matter.
Apple executives in Cupertino were already questioning the entertainment units over the amount of money being spent on movies, and the people said there was a thought within the company to not risk a public disappointment should the movie not succeed at the box office.
CAA, the agency that represents Mr. Clooney, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Watts, did not fight the last-minute move, since the lack of promotion could have led to a theatrical underperformance affecting its clients' reputations, the people said.
A spokesperson for CAA declined to comment.
Both competitors and those who work for Apple are rooting for the company's success. With the overall box office down 15 percent from last year, Paramount laying off 15 percent of its employees before its pending merger and Warner Bros. Discovery struggling with its enormous debt load, Hollywood would love for Apple to keep spending money on movies. It seems likely to be disappointed.
This spring, top executives held a meeting at company headquarters. The result was a new edict, according to two people familiar with the details, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an internal gathering. Apple's studio would make one or two event-size films a year, with big budgets and expansive theatrical releases. The rest of its films would have budgets of $ 80 million or less, the people said.
Apple is still planning a big theatrical release next July for its movie "F1," from the director Joseph Kosinski ("Top Gun: Maverick"), in partnership with Warner Bros.
Mr. Pitt is playing the leading role.

A Great Year for a Film Critic To Begin Finding His Voice: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At the box office 25 years ago, hits like "Runaway Bride," "The Sixth Sense" and "Bowfinger" hint at the abundance that overwhelmed a young critic.
One thing to love about time is how liberating it can be. I, for instance, am at liberty to look at the Top 10 movies for the weekend of Aug. 20, 1999 -- when "The Sixth Sense," in its third week out, began its monopoly of the chart -- and declare "The Thomas Crown Affair" the best of the lot.
What could be going on here? Am I actually saying that a Pierce Brosnan-Rene Russo remake of the old Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway love heist, from 1968, was always superior to M. Night Shyamalan's where'd-that-come-from supernatural smash? Or have 25 years ripened one and grayed the other? Hadn't "The Blair Witch Project" opened in July yet was still very much a thing? (It had, yet it was, down at No. 5.) Only one of the 10 movies was a sequel. In the mix were Julia Roberts, at her commercial peak, in "Runaway Bride" (No. 4, after opening in July) and Steve Martin and a gonzo Eddie Murphy, holding at second, in "Bowfinger."
So why I am hugging the remake?
For one thing, that's the kind of year 1999 was: a lot of everything. It's almost a reflex now, to claim it was just about the greatest class of movies there ever was. Brian Raftery called his breathlessly chummy history of 1999 "Best. Movie. Year. Ever." Though, I've always sought clarification on "greatest," because this had never been a year of easily triumphant or consensus work. Try 1939, '68 or '89 for wonders of the world. "Great," in 1999, denotes range, volume, abundance, deluge. It's quality capturing quantity: a megalopolis skyline as opposed to a mountain range.
Twenty-five years later, 1999 is known for being the year of Shyamalan's movie, of "Blair Witch" and "American Beauty," which came out in September and went on, somehow, to win the best picture Oscar. The year is remembered for "Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace" and "The Matrix," which had opened in March and by August was winding down its initial colonization of the cultural imagination. It was known for existential identity crackups, and a pervasive itch of anomie, that you could sense in "Office Space," "Election," "Dick" and "Fight Club," which weren't hits, but also in "American Pie," which very much was. So Raftery's breathless tone seems right. It was the last most-exciting period for American moviegoing. It was the last most-exciting time to write about the movies.
IN THE SPRING OF 1999, Barbara Shulgasser-Parker stepped down from her film critic's post at The San Francisco Examiner, which then chose me to fill her shoes. I was 23. I wore board shorts and flip-flops to the office. My T-shirts were from Urban Outfitters. I had studied film in college and, when The Examiner called, had been drifting vaguely toward graduate school. But suddenly professional moviegoing doubled as secondary education: I was being paid to learn -- no financial debt but a lifetime debt of gratitude. 1999: Best. Movie. School. Ever.
A quantitative framing of "great" is evident in a roll call of filmmakers whose movies opened in the United States that year. Every major, majorish, soon-to-be-major director; every solid hack, journeyman and Kleenexploitationist; Pixar! -- they all crammed into 1999's elevator.
Read 'em and weep.
The veterans and elders: Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Stanley Kubrick, Sydney Pollack, Clint Eastwood, Norman Jewison, Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, Milos Forman, Ron Howard, Carlos Saura, Alan Rudolph, Franco Zeffirelli, Alan Parker, Neil Jordan, Lawrence Kasdan.
The funny guys: Woody Allen, Rob Reiner, Albert Brooks, Barry Sonnenfeld, Harold Ramis, Frank Oz.
The art-housers: Jane Campion, Ang Lee, Giuseppe Tornatore, John Sayles, Mike Leigh, Wim Wenders, Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Pedro Almodóvar, Hirokazu Kore-eda, David Mamet, Anthony Minghella, Mike Figgis.
The weirdos: David Cronenberg, Hayao Miyazaki, David Lynch, Sam Raimi.
The cool kids: Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, David O. Russell, David Fincher, Michael Mann, Nancy Savoca, Lana and Lilly Wachowski.
The new kids: Shyamalan, Christopher Nolan, Guy Ritchie, Spike Jonze, Alexander Payne, Julie Taymor, Sam Mendes, Tom Tykwer, Trey Parker.
Within two November weekends of each other: Wayne Wang, Kevin Smith, Atom Egoyan, Luc Besson, Barry Levinson and Tim Burton.
Few of their movies are what anybody would classify as peak them. Many of these names were taking detours, breaking character, trying something. Spike Lee made a serial-killer thriller ("Summer of Sam"); Mike Leigh, a comedy about Gilbert and Sullivan ("Topsy-Turvy"); Ang Lee, a Civil War western ("Ride With the Devil"). Wes Craven tried Kleenexploitation and made a Meryl Streep movie. If they weren't making their "best" film, a lot of them probably made your favorite of theirs.
I wrote anywhere from three to five reviews a week, and used the job to quietly stalk my heroes, begging friends to introduce me to Manohla Dargis and J. Hoberman so I could put my foot in my mouth. The job used me to immediately file a review of "The Phantom Menace" from a New York hotel by phoning it in. On the other end of the line was a beloved copy editor named Bobbie Hess, who summoned the lordly strength to get herself through all of my midair backspacing. I had about five hours to watch and assess Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" and the parochial joke of its digital fig leaves. For me, cruel and unusual punishment would entail having to read either one of those two things. Reading both might kill me dead.
The job was a dream come true; but that year was something out of a nightmare, the bucket-and-brooms sequence of "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" but with a notepad. It was too much. I can see it now. I can say it. Too much for 23-year-old me. But also too much for America. There were a lot of hit movies that year. And it just feels like the ones we missed whizzed by because neither Lucy nor Ethel had room in their maw to stuff another bonbon, let alone to taste anything. It's taken years to see everything we didn't see, to figure out what it all was, to discover what it meant, and how much to treasure it. And yet the glutton in me, the maximalist, the hoarder, yearns to invoke 1999's 15th-biggest song: I want it that way.
Why, though? Well, because what almost certainly made iffy business sense made all the cultural sense in the world. There was something for just about everybody. And even if a movie wasn't "for you," it was ready to blow your mind, get on your nerves, freak you out. Genres were being reconsidered, expanded, rejected, mocked, obeyed. Nobody, in a given week, could rely on the same-old, same-old. Even the many bad movies -- and they truly don't get worse than the substantial John Travolta hit "The General's Daughter" -- were ... interesting. That's probably the word to sit alongside "great."
"Interesting" has long lost any meaningful association with enthusiasm, fascination or importance. But that's really what made 1999: It was the most interesting year. The masterpiece was not the dominant mode. Risk and idiosyncrasy were. Take "Inspector Gadget," down at No. 7 and, after a month, still raking it in. The trend of awful movies that began as old TV was in full effect in '99 -- "Wild Wild West," "The Mod Squad," "My Favorite Martian," "Dudley Do-Right." And if you were taking "Inspector" the cartoon and turning it into a Matthew Broderick romantic comedy, somebody had to figure out how to get his gadgets to go-go in live action, how to go-go gloopily enough to get a 7-year-old to go ga-ga.
More interesting now is how determined to become an old-fashioned beat cop this plucky, all-but-adolescent Gadget is and how invested the city's shady brass (Cheri Oteri and Dabney Coleman, ga-ga experts) is in Joely Fisher's Supercop technology. When rich meany Dr. Claw (Rupert Everett) clones Gadget so that good Broderick can beat his mechanical bad self up, two law enforcement fantasies collide.
I WORKED ALONGSIDE three indefatigable critics, Walter Addiego, G. Allen Johnson and Bob Stephens. They handled both what I couldn't and, though I'm ashamed to confess it now, what I was too cool for. I was too cool for "Inspector Gadget," for instance. So Allen dealt with it. That was something I had to curb in my approach to the job: cool, yes; too cool, no. I had been a big Village Voice reader and those folks -- Hoberman and Amy Taubin and Dennis Lim, Jessica Winter and Michael Atkinson -- seemed ultracool to me. I did a lot of Village Voice karaoke back then while I figured out a voice that sounded like mine.
There was so much movie criticism being done by so many different people with so many different approaches to watching and writing about movies. So many peeves and politics and theories. That summer, Roger Ebert invited me to co-host two episodes of "At the Movies" following Gene Siskel's death. After we taped, he walked me around Chicago and offered what felt, to a cool kid, like radical advice: Forget theory, write for everybody. So I spent that year learning and unlearning. What to do with my peeves? What were my politics? Everybody, Roger?
With the movies in that Aug. 20 Top 10, I was figuring it all out. Renny Harlan's genius-shark thriller, "Deep Blue Sea," was in ninth place and kind of a hit in its third week. I don't know why I spent so much of the review lamenting that one of my favorite musicians (LL Cool J) was now a stock character at a doomed oceanic research station: Black Cook Who Knows He's Gonna Die.
Yet it's clear that my peeves were my politics. It was a good year to air those politics in order, say, to lament what the movies were asking of Black people -- the men, anyway; you had to wait all the way until October and "The Best Man" to find a Black woman with much more to do than sit around or fall over. For the men, the juiciest parts were behind bars: Isaiah Washington in "True Crime," Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence in "Life," Michael Clarke Duncan in "The Green Mile," Denzel Washington in "The Hurricane." One sobering thing about "The Matrix" is that at least Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus and Gloria Foster's Oracle were trying to get the word out that none of us was free.
TWO AND A HALF DECADES LATER, that Aug. 20 crop is still pretty tasty. Movie stars still meant something to us. Sometimes, they were thinking aloud about their meaning. Roberts spends a long hunk of "Runaway Bride" at a hair salon debating the value of personality types with Joan Cusack. What's better: quirky or weird or mysterious? It's a wonderful bit. This movie star, one of the greatest, is considering what makes her her alongside one of the great character actors, a title that falls to anybody too weird or too quirky and not mysterious enough to be a regular star.
As a movie, this thing still works. It's the same "Pretty Woman" lineup -- Roberts, Richard Gere, Héctor Elizondo, Garry Marshall directing. But a new plot and a decade more definition on Roberts's and Gere's stardom dispel the reek of desperation. Something's being advanced, compounded rather than merely retrod. (Another "Universal Soldier"? That's desperate.) Gere's a chauvinist USA Today columnist fired for getting a bunch of stuff wrong in a story about how Roberts jilted a bunch of fiancés. Vowing to report the real story, he swans down to her small Maryland town -- for GQ!
She and Gere don't need to Go There. But all you want to know is how the plot mechanics are going to send them anyway. The movie takes its sweet time resolving all its questions. Namely: How could Gere be dumb enough to fall for her? Because she's Julia Roberts, yes. But also because the person Gere's playing -- and having a blast doing so -- really is narcissistically dumb. The only way this movie works is if Roberts and Gere have some kind of ancient movie history for the comedy to play with.
Lots of actors had a good 1999. Nobody had a better one than Roberts. Nine weeks before "Runaway Bride," she let Hugh Grant mope and sputter his way into her heart in "Notting Hill" and people went crazy for that.
The movies were still trying to figure out what else this superhuman cardigan could do. "Mickey Blue Eyes" takes Grant's English auctioneer and marries him to the mob. Once you see his version of a wiseguy -- it's like watching someone getting ready to sneeze -- you wish the movie had done more with the marriage. This movie treats the meekness and bookish charisma that worked on Roberts as evidence of feminine mystique. When he breaks into a run, Jeanne Tripplehorn, as his schoolteacher girlfriend, actually laughs at him. This is Grant's first stateside swing, and out of the gate, the movie's wondering if he's man enough for us.
I have no memory of going to see "Bowfinger." But evidently I did -- and dug it. Steve Martin wrote, Frank Oz directed. The plot's absurd and absurdly complicated. Martin plays a deluded filmmaker who can't land the biggest star in Hollywood, an insecure egotist named Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), for his new sci-fi-action movie ("Chubby Rain"). So he stalks him and instructs his cast and crew to shoot around an unwitting Kit. Martin keeps his cross hairs fixed on the movie business but also on Scientology (Kit's an adherent of an outfit called MindHead). They've tossed in so many throwaway gags that half of those could be the basis of a second rude comedy.
It's 97 minutes (movies ran shorter then), and after 85, the "check engine" light comes on. The movie is smartly, warmly cast around its edges, as perfectly as "Mickey Blue Eyes" and "Runaway Bride" are around theirs. But Murphy is still the magnet, live-wiring his way through it all: antic, paranoid, horny. The coup is Martin giving him another chance at Peter Sellers excess, introducing Kit's dorky brother and having Murphy play him, too. The circumstances are resonant. Murphy used to be the biggest star in the world. Then it was "Metro" and "Holy Man." In "Bowfinger," he's at a piquant 10 out of the gate, screaming for respect at anybody he sees: "Get my door just as fast as you get Tom Hanks's!" Bowfinger" ended up only a loose hit. But everybody remembers it for how superbly meta Murphy seemed to be.
Before 1999, "meta" was not a concept I had really grasped. Suddenly, every third movie seemed to be in some way about itself, filmmaking or the movie business. John Malkovich as a personal theme-park ride landed in meta's hipster strike zone. The Voice introduced its annual film poll in 1999, which "Being John Malkovich" topped. (It was also near the top of whatever list I made that year.) But "The Blair Witch Project" was meta's commercial and cultural gateway.
The first time I watched it was beside Ebert. The movie ended, and I sat there chilled, shocked that its three filmmaker protagonists were never found. He saw my open mouth and hunted for the appropriate paternal warmth to break the news: "That's because they're not real." Until then, I remember watching a particular kind of tragedy: middle-class white kids lost in America looking for ghosts they couldn't understand.
The second time I watched it was two weeks ago. And I was amused by how taken I had been with the arguably new conceit of found-footage filmmaking. Twenty-five years under the "Blair Witch" influence has rendered identifiable a D.I.Y. language for cheap thrills. And yet the shakes and blurs and amateurish camcorder operation affected me anyway, the way the mics hear what can't be seen until one character tries locating the source of the night bumps.
M. Night Shyamalan trots out a jump scare or two in "The Sixth Sense," but he was principally old-fashioned. He made a melodrama disguised in a bedsheet, like E.T. at Halloween. My worst tendencies converged the evening I originally saw it: I was so cool I passed out -- "The Sixth Sense," a sleeper in every way! I awoke in time for the reveal, which at least confirmed where Bruce Willis's charisma had gone: limbo.
I hadn't watched this one in its entirety since, but it's all as I recalled. The sepulchral dankness across Shyamalan's Philadelphia. The exquisitely whispery tenderness of Haley Joel Osment's acting. What a calf he was. (And what a crime for him to lose an Oscar to anything having to do with "The Cider House Rules," even Michael Caine.) Toni Collette, as Osment's mother, also made an impression on me. Shyamalan didn't have to write her part this fully; she didn't need to etch it so finely. Yet the movie's all the more devastating for their labor. I was moved this time. That was new. In 25 years, I've learned what it means to carry sorrow. And this is one of Shyamalan's strongest studies of grief's geological table.
My misgivings haven't changed. Willis's child psychologist character is a gimmick. It's as if Shyamalan watched "Ghost" and thought, what if nobody knew Patrick Swayze was dead. The gimmick is a problem. If people could see this guy hovering incessantly near this little boy, we wouldn't be here. We'd be in "Doubt." Which raises a conundrum, because any time Willis exists away from Osment, the movie's dead, too.
So. This has been me taking the scenic route to explain why I still like "The Thomas Crown Affair" better. It was just such a surprise to rediscover how professional a movie it is. Just serious enough about what it's up to and yet loose, sexy, aware of what it is. Brosnan's a Manhattan moneybags who steals Impressionist oils with the Robb Report zeal his homies would put into golf. Russo's the insurance investigator on his tail and seduced into a conflict of interest. Side-eyeing them both is Denis Leary's detective. John McTiernan keeps it all kinds of light. But it's never frivolous. There are stakes. Mostly, they're Russo's: Is she really going out with him? Unclear. But she's having a good time figuring that out.
This was still a time when characters had sex for no reason other than that's what people do. Though you could already feel the Clinton scandal changing our ease with that. But the sex in "The Thomas Crown Affair" will shake your leg a little. Russo was in the goddess mold that Sophia Loren, Catherine Deneuve and Gina Lollobrigida helped shape. American movies have erased their sort of womanliness. The fun Russo's having in "Thomas Crown" is the fun of a woman who loves being herself and who loves being with Brosnan.
I SPENT THE LAST NIGHT of the last year of the 20th century alone on a hill overlooking downtown San Francisco, waiting for what turned out to be nothing. The Examiner nobly sent its staff to explore and inspect the Bay Area in anticipation of Y2K, an anticlimax that was the closest I came that year to a vacation. Anticlimax felt right. Where do you go after 1999? We'd made it to the 2000s, where fresh crises awaited. But it's clear now that we left the bounties of '99 back there.
It's too much to say that everything since at the movies has been anticlimactic. But hasn't it? "The Sixth Sense" was the second-highest-grossing movie that year. The top earner made almost double. That was "Phantom Menace," which, despite how loudly George Lucas's directing begs to differ, was cooked up for world domination. The lesson Hollywood learned was more of that and less Shyamalan, more bankable certainty, less spaghetti at the wall. Shyamalan still got to be himself, and continues to be. But I've always had the sense that his success was a fluke that in the minds of some of the studios' bottom-line thinkers might not have warranted the gamble. The first "X-Men" movie would open in 2000. It made a star of both Hugh Jackman and the mutant he played, a part he's performing, still, to enormous sales in "Deadpool & Wolverine." Shyamalan's latest original, "Trap," is doing ... OK. But boy, does that title double as concise cultural criticism.
1999 was one of the last years in which nobody totally knew what might happen when you put a movie out. We didn't know what we wanted. We were as much in the habit of being curious as being marketed to. It was the last of the riskiest years. And maybe all of that gambling was bad business. It's still hard for me to believe that year actually happened. I guess I was a risk, too. It's hard, now, to believe somebody took it.

Topic of Domestic Abuse Puts Film in Tight Focus: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Its depiction of love-bombing and psychological abuse rings true, experts say, but other oversimplified aspects could send a dangerous message.
A person trying to escape an abusive relationship, on average, needs seven attempts to actually leave. Lily Bloom, the protagonist of the new drama "It Ends With Us," needs only one.
In the hit adaptation of the best-selling Colleen Hoover novel, Bloom (Blake Lively) is a young woman who grew up watching her father repeatedly hit her mother and who sees her own marriage to the seemingly perfect neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni, also the film's director) deteriorate into physical and emotional abuse. When Bloom learns she's pregnant with Kincaid's child after a violent night, she decides to get out.
Professionals who counsel domestic violence survivors or work on related issues say "It Ends With Us" is an oversimplified depiction of being in and leaving an abusive relationship. But whether it's a potential tool for advocacy or an unattainable vision of escaping abuse depends on whom you ask.
"I think it's very likely that people are going to come to the movie and see themselves in Lily," said Pamela Jacobs, the chief executive officer of the nonprofit organization the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence. She said that although "It Ends With Us" had problems, she was surprised by how well it showed abuse overall.
The big inaccuracy to professionals is how easily Bloom leaves once she realizes she is being abused. In real life, she would probably have faced stalking, harassment and other escalating pressure tactics, including violence.
In "It Ends With Us," Bloom and her husband peacefully part ways after a single conversation. Jacobs said Bloom's departure was unrealistically smooth thanks to her financial independence (she owns a flower shop) and unwavering community support, including from her best friend, who is also Kincaid's sister.
"I just hope that survivors who watch this movie don't compare themselves too much to Lily's story, because she was able to get away much easier than people typically are," Jacobs said.
Andrea Wainer, a New York City clinical social worker and therapist who works with survivors of domestic abuse, said the movie's message could be dangerous, as it doesn't explain the careful planning that goes into safely leaving.
"It's quite a battle to leave," she said. "If people identify that they are in abusive relationships and then after having watched this movie have courage to leave, some will end up being killed. Many will end up without their children. Many will end up homeless and depressed, and most will have PTSD," she said, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder.
Wainer, a survivor of domestic abuse herself, said several aspects of the film rang false: Bloom doesn't get ensnared in a custody battle, she doesn't face financial struggles after becoming dependent on her abuser, and she doesn't experience any work disruption, social isolation or the other harsh realities of escaping.
One thing the movie does get right, experts said, is the romance at the beginning of the relationship. Almost as soon as he sees Bloom, Kincaid is on a charm offensive, a tactic known as "love bombing," and he plies her with flowers and insistent requests.
His controlling behavior continues once they're in a relationship. When he hurts her, he convinces her it was only a series of accidents, and she comforts him instead. Jacobs praised the focus on psychological abuse and a dynamic in which victims misread behaviors like jealousy and possessiveness as romantic.
But the movie's marketing has also come in for criticism from experts. Much of the discussion about "It Ends With Us" has centered on the press tour, in part because of the dissonance between the film's cheery, floral-heavy promotion and its dark story.
Maddie Spear, a therapist in Raleigh, N.C., makes online videos under the handle @Therapy Thoughts. She said she was surprised by how well the movie showed some aspects of abuse, but that made her even more disappointed in its marketing. She especially took issue with an interview in which Lively emphasized that Bloom was more than her abuse.
"While that's a really hopeful perspective, survivors of trauma and especially of intimate partner violence and domestic violence know that is not a part of them that they can just turn off and they can just get rid of," said Spear, who works with young adults and has treated many clients who have experienced abuse in early relationships.
Jacobs and Spear both expressed hope that despite its inaccuracies, the movie could help viewers get the courage to think about leaving an abusive relationship.
The movie has received over $ 180 million at the global box office, but it's difficult to say whether it has helped viewers. A spokeswoman for the National Domestic Violence Hotline said that it hadn't seen an increase in calls tied to the movie, but it had recorded a 10 percent rise in website traffic since the film was released on Aug. 9.
The production company behind the movie, Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, partnered with the No More Foundation, which focuses on awareness campaigns around domestic violence, to consult on some aspects of the depiction and to develop resources that viewers can learn about from the credits. Compared with the same time period in July, a spokesman said, the organization had experienced an 800 percent increase in website visits, three times the usual traffic to its support service directory in the United States as well as a 525 percent increase in downloaded resources.
The group's platform No More Silence, which invites survivors and victims of domestic abuse to safely and anonymously share their stories, has also seen a jump to more than 40 posts a week from a few since "It Ends With Us" was released.
"I knew this movie would change everything for me and it did," reads one recent addition from an anonymous poster. "I finally left him and as hard as it was, it was the best thing for me and for my future. I believe you have one life, why would I let it go to waste on someone like that?"

A Coming-of-Middle-Age Story: [Review]

Full text: And meets his former music teacher, upending his life, in Nathan Silver's touching comedy, starring Jason Schwartzman and Carol Kane.
Ben Gottlieb -- the touchingly soulful hero of the soulful, delightfully tetchy "Between the Temples" -- is a mess. He needs a haircut and a shave; he could do with better-fitting clothes. He's having problems at work. He also lives in his family's basement, that much-derided refuge of the eternal man-child and terminal loser. Yet because the filmmaker Nathan Silver has an appreciation for life's ironies and likes putting a topspin on his comedy, Ben lives with both his mother and stepmother. He lives, in other words, in his mothers' basement.
Ben -- a perfect Jason Schwartzman -- is a sad sack, but he's also just sad and for a very good, excruciating reason, too. His wife died not long ago, leaving him bereft and, increasingly, without an evident sense of self or purpose. He seems to have lost his bearings, but he's also lost his singing voice, which proves a problem given that he's the cantor at a local synagogue. He still teaches there, working out of a cramped, shambolic classroom in which he helps boys and girls prepare for their bar and bat mitzvahs, the traditional Jewish coming-of-age ceremonies that formally announce the passage from childhood to adulthood.
Set in the present in an upstate New York hamlet, this coming-of-middle-age story follows Ben during an eventful time in his life, which takes a turn after he runs into his former elementary-school music teacher, Carla Kessler O'Connor (Carol Kane, divine). They reconnect in a bar, where she helps the soused, deflated Ben, a kindness that takes an unexpected turn when she shows up at the synagogue. Carla wants to take his class, explaining that she never had a bat mitzvah. Ben is reluctant because, well, she isn't a child, but after consulting with his boss, Rabbi Bruce (Robert Smigel), Ben relents. A friendship blossoms and perhaps something deeper does, too, and the movie gets its blissfully offbeat groove on.
Silver, who wrote the movie with C. Mason Wells, introduces Ben without preamble, immediately dropping you into a conversation that started before the movie did. Ben and his mothers, Meira and Judith (the nicely synced Caroline Aaron and Dolly de Leon), are in the family's dining room having an apparently serious heart-to-heart. Judith says they think he "needs to start seeing a doctor," a suggestion that Ben says he's open to. As the camera zooms out, Ben keeps talking only to be cut off by the doorbell. The moms jump up, and a pretty female doctor enters and almost immediately begins hitting on Ben, a shift that abruptly gives new meaning to the advice the moms have just voiced.
With the doctor's entrance, the movie turns straightaway from the plaintive to the humorous. The scene is characteristic of how Silver changes up the tone and mood, creating an unexpected pacing that's complemented by Sean Price Williams's agitated cinematography and the jumpy rhythms of John Magary's editing. The movie is laced with absurd setups, slapstick and some silly props, all of which converge in a scene at a restaurant called the Chained Duck (the name of a satirical French newspaper). There, Ben and Carla have dinner with her belligerent son, Nat (Matthew Shear), a hostility that Silver slyly deflates when the waiter hands everyone menus as large as battleground shields.
The outlandish menus undercut the son's disproportionate, clenched-jaw anger at Carla without draining the scene of its tense realism or turning the son into the butt of the joke. Silver is a sharp, cleareyed observer of human nature, and while he pokes at his characters, including Ben, it's more teasing than cruel. If there's a mean joke in "Between the Temples," I missed it, which helps explain where Silver is coming from. He and Schwartzman make Ben's pain palpable without sentimentalizing it; you see the hurt in the sag of Ben's shoulders and in the melancholy that clouds his eyes. Yet there's a fundamental resilience to the character who, while he's sometimes off on his own, is never really alone.
"Between the Temples" is about a man in mourning and in crisis, but it's also about the people in his life: his moms, the synagogue's congregation, its golf-loving rabbi (who putts into a shofar) and the rabbi's conveniently, anxiously single daughter (Madeline Weinstein). Ben is the straight man in the comedy of his life, the foil to the funny men and women swirling and sometimes crowding around him, sweeping him up -- as Carla does -- in their arms, metaphoric and not. This is crucial to Silver's interests, as well as an effective declaration of principles. The movie is consistently funny, but its humor tends to be fairly gentle because it's rooted in human behavior rather than in condescending, judgmental ideas about such behavior.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Things happen to Ben, but mostly desiring, loving, nudging women happen to him. At one point early on, Carla takes Ben to a favorite restaurant, where they each order hamburgers. As he chows down, Carla announces that what makes the burgers tasty is the cheese stuffed inside the meat. Ben blanches -- the burger isn't kosher -- spitting up a pulpy mouthful. It's an ickily funny moment, one that directly echoes an infamous scene in Elaine May's brilliant 1972 comedy "The Heartbreak Kid" in which a Jewish newlywed (Charles Grodin) watches his new bride (Jeannie Berlin, May's daughter) messily eat an egg-salad sandwich. Appalled, he soon leaves her for a gentile only to end up married again yet very much alone.
When "The Heartbreak Kid" was released, its diner scene was widely criticized as offensive and misogynist, though it's about a pathetic guy who can't see the beauty in front of him. May's film is now more often rightly considered a paragon in a cycle of films that started in the late 1960s and which the critic J. Hoberman has memorably called Hollywood's "Jew wave." After years of obscuring Jewish identity, American movies showcased stars like Elliott Gould and, as Hoberman put it, "featured a hitherto unspeakable degree of Jewish content." Silver owes a substantial debt to May, who helped make the unspeakable glorious and whose influence on a new generation of filmmakers is, I think, one reason this May-December story, as it were, sings so beautifully.

New Chinese Video Game Is Hit. Its List of Forbidden Topics Isn't.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Black Myth: Wukong tried to forbid influential overseas streamers from discussing "feminist propaganda," Covid-19 and China's video game industry policies.
Black Myth: Wukong is one of the most highly anticipated Chinese video games ever, a premium title with a blockbuster-worthy budget that underscores the country's push to become a global cultural power.
But ahead of its debut on Tuesday, a company affiliated with the game's China-based developer rankled some influential overseas players with a list of topics to avoid discussing while livestreaming the game.
The list of forbidden subjects laid out in a document under "Don'ts" -- politics, "feminist propaganda," Covid-19, China's video game industry policies and other content that "instigates negative discourse" -- offered a glimpse of the restrictions that content creators face in China as well as the topics deemed sensitive to Beijing.
"I have never seen anything that shameful in my 15 years doing this job. This is very clearly a document which explains that we must censor ourselves," said Benoit Reinier, a prominent video game streamer on YouTube and a French journalist, in a YouTube video.
Game Science, the game's developer, and Hero Games, which is handling its marketing, did not respond to an email seeking comment.
The game's release is a landmark moment for China's gaming industry. It is considered China's first "AAA" title, a big-budget, global game with sophisticated gameplay and advanced graphics. Chinese news media has reported it is one of the most expensive games ever developed there, with a budget exceeding $ 50 million.
Within hours of its release, there were more than 1.5 million people playing it on Steam, making it the No. 1 game on the online platform.
Black Myth: Wukong is based on a classic 16th-century Chinese novel called "Journey to the West." The game's protagonist is inspired by Sun Wukong, also known as the Monkey King, who fights opponents with a staff. Game Science also has the backing of Tencent Holdings, one of China's biggest technology conglomerates and its top video game publisher, which holds a 5 percent stake in the developer.
China's video game industry is dominated by titles played on smartphones, not big-budget console or PC games that are released globally. Black Myth: Wukong is initially being released on Sony's PlayStation 5 and personal computers.
The industry has been in turmoil in China over the last several years. The government has sought to rein it in over concerns that children could grow addicted and be corrupted by games. Beijing introduced rules prohibiting young people from playing games online on school days and imposing time limits on games on weekends and holidays.
But the game's debut has been met by a swell of national pride, with the game becoming a top trending topic on Weibo, China's version of X. One Chinese media outlet noted in a Weibo hashtag that the game's default language is Chinese and added: "It feels so good."
The global interest in the game also highlighted China's push to exercise its "soft power." The novel that it is based on is considered one of China's four great classics. The game also depicts important cultural landmarks throughout China.
"The success of Black Myth: Wukong is not only a victory for the gaming industry, but also an important milestone in the overseas expansion of Chinese culture," Yangcheng Evening News, a state-owned newspaper, wrote in an article.
The Department of Culture and Tourism in Shanxi Province released a video highlighting landmarks in northern China featured in the game. In another sign of its close ties to the state, the game's publisher is Zhejiang Publishing & Media, a company majority owned by the Zhejiang provincial government.
In an interview, Mr. Reinier said he received an email from Hero Games, which owns nearly 20 percent of Game Science and has financial ties to several state-owned enterprises, about three weeks ago asking if he would be interested in a free virtual "key" to play the game. Mr. Reinier, who said this is a common industry practice for streamers, responded that he was interested.
When Hero Games sent Mr. Reinier the key, it also linked to a document that "outlines the essential dos and don'ts regarding content creation." By using the key to livestream, "you acknowledge that you have been informed of the following guidelines," the document said.
Mr. Reinier said this was sent unilaterally and that it had no legal weight, but he chose not to stream the game.
The list of "don't" discuss topics included Covid-19, "quarantine" or "isolation."
Beijing has sought to rewrite its handling of the pandemic. China's "zero-Covid" policy helped to contain the virus for almost three years, but it crumbled amid widespread opposition. After the government dismantled the policy, China's censors erased mentions of many of the hardships, such as extended periods of forced isolation for hundreds of millions of people.
Another forbidden topic seemed to be targeted at criticism of misogyny at Game Science. The company has come under fire for lewd and sexist comments attributed in media reports to its founders as well as recruiting materials from 2015 replete with sexual innuendos. Those original job postings and comments were deleted, and the company has not commented.
As of Tuesday, a Chinese hashtag translated as "Black Myth: Wukong insults women," had been viewed nine million times on Weibo.

Saying Goodbye to Life With a Leaving Party: [Style Desk]

Full text: Modern, even hip, mortuaries around the world are hoping to answer one question: How do we commemorate death in 2024?
In the affluent neighborhood of Crouch End in London, a new business is attracting some attention. The storefront's blue-and-white facade is airy and minimalist. Three polka-dot vases on plinths sit in the window. To the casual observer, the space might look like an art gallery. But through the window is something a little more curious: a sea-foam-green box measuring 7 feet by 2 feet.
It's generally upon noticing the box that passers-by will do a double-take of the shop's signage: Exit Here. The polka dot vases aren't vases. They're urns. The box is a coffin. And in the back, unknown to them, is a 12-person morgue.
"We knew the name would be Marmite," said Oliver Peyton, a renowned restaurateur, comparing the polarized reactions to his funeral home's somewhat cheeky name to those elicited by the yeasty British spread. "You either love it or you hate it. My mother-in-law hates it."
Mr. Peyton, who founded the first branch of Exit Here in the neighborhood of Chiswick in 2019 as a modern alternative to traditional funeral parlors, is a familiar face on the British hospitality scene: He was the founder of the Atlantic Bar & Grill, a West London hot spot that closed in 2006, and he served as a judge on the BBC show "Great British Menu."
Mr. Peyton, 62, who is originally from Sligo, Ireland, became interested in the mortuary business while planning a funeral for his father, who died in 2010. He felt that there weren't enough choices in the process. "Funerals are historically a hand-me-down business," he said, adding that people tend to use the funeral parlor that's closest to their home.
He also believes funeral planning is not so different from hospitality. "It's still a service industry," he said. "We're taking care of people at a very heightened emotional period in their lives."
Exit Here is among a small group of funeral homes around the world -- like Sparrow in New York, Poppy's in London and Altima in Spain -- with a modern feel.
Exit Here's new Crouch End space, with its velvet upholstery and curved archways, resembles a fancy members-only club. Altima, a chain with 40 homes around the Catalonia region, works with the architecture firm Batlleiroig to build parlors that resemble art galleries, featuring marble and lattice brickwork. The walls at Sparrow are dusty rose and forest green, and there is always incense burning.
For funeral homes, they're surprisingly hip.
Looks aren't everything, of course. These businesses also tend to offer nontraditional services like support groups for the bereaved and memorials personalized down to every detail.
'It's Going to Be Fabulous'
Steven Wilson, 47, discovered Exit Here in 2020 on a walk near his house in Chiswick. "What a brilliant name," he thought to himself at the time. After being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, which he eventually learned was terminal, he returned in March to start planning his own funeral.
Past memorials Mr. Wilson has attended have served as cautionary tales. When his boyfriend died in 2014, the minister knew nothing beyond his name. "They played a nine-minute medley of 'November Rain,"' Mr. Wilson said, adding that he "never once" heard his boyfriend play Guns N' Roses. "The whole thing was just utterly impersonal."
Mr. Wilson, who worked in philanthropy, said his own funeral was going to be "fabulous," using an alliterative curse word for emphasis. On the top of his hand was a freshly applied I.V. bandage.
He saw it as a gift to have the time to plan his own funeral. "It sounds strange, but I want people to enjoy it," he said. And so, sometime probably within the next six months, his friends and family will gather in his hometown, Aberdeen, Scotland, where his body will lie in a coffin draped in a rainbow flag.
Instead of traditional programs, memory books divided into eras of Mr. Wilson's life ("Very Taylor Swift," as he put it) will be handed out as Jo Napthine, a former West End star and a professional funeral celebrant, belts numbers from Mr. Wilson's favorite musicals: "Bring Me Home" from "Les Miserables"; "Somewhere" from "West Side Story"; "Tomorrow" from "Annie."
And later, at the crematory: "My Way" by Frank Sinatra.
The 'Sweetgreen' of Funeral Homes
For much of her life, Natividad Hawkins, who lives in Hillside, N.J., knew of only one funeral home in the Brooklyn neighborhood where she grew up. "It was where we all went when someone died," said Ms. Hawkins, who arranged her mother's funeral there in 2021. "The lady working there was very nice, but it was very much a transactional thing."
It was only last year after attending the funeral of her childhood best friend, held at Sparrow in Greenpoint, that Ms. Hawkins realized there were other options.
According to its founder, Erica Hill, people have been known to wander into Sparrow, which opened in 2021, thinking it's a spa. The home has a morgue and two "celebration rooms," as they're called, for memorials, as well as a shop, where candles and condolence cards with line drawings are sold.
Ms. Hawkins, who is now in her 50s and works in tech, was struck by how beautiful the space was and how uplifting the service for her friend turned out to be.
When her brother, Francis Ortega, died in October, Ms. Hawkins knew where she wanted to hold the funeral. "As a self-aware control freak, I appreciated the fact they were never like, 'This is how we do it,"' she said. "It was always, 'What do you want?"'
Ms. Hill, 61, said Sparrow's services were aimed at people who were looking for something that feels "warm and inviting."
She likened her business to Sweetgreen or SoulCycle. "They repackage something, rebrand it and make it look cool," she said. "What we're doing is in the same realm."
Nicola Tuer, the former chief operating officer at Sony Music in Britain and Ireland, was so taken with Exit Here's branding that she referred to it on the mood board for the funeral of her husband, Tim Tuer, when he died of a brain tumor in October. The memorial was held at the celebrity chef Rick Stein's seafood restaurant in the neighborhood of Barnes in London, in what was the eatery's first-ever funeral. There were personalized bottles of wine -- "Have a drink on me. Château Tuer 1961" -- and lovingly prepared memory books that bore the same typeface and color palette as Exit Here.
"I know it's a silly thing to say, but we liked beautiful things, as I think a lot of people do," Ms. Tuer, 58, said. Her husband was buried in a "gorgeous" Scandinavian coffin. "He'd have been happy to be there."
Doing Death Differently
Aesthetic developments seem to be a reflection of changing conversations around death. "Younger people especially are getting more comfortable talking about it," Ms. Hill of Sparrow said. Look at the rise in popularity of death doulas, who provide support for the dying -- and in some cases, the grieving, too. In the United States, end-of-life planning sites like Lantern and Cake, which are marketed toward millennials, easier to navigate and more transparent about their pricing, have sprung up.
Which is not to say that so-called traditional or mainstream funeral homes are not adapting. In recent years, Co-Op Funeralcare, one of the largest funeral services providers in the United Kingdom, has changed its tune. Advertisements are now geared toward not only personalization, but also fostering openness around death. In July, the company worked with Channel 4 on a television show called "Celebrity Send Off," in which stars and their loved ones plan and test-run a funeral.
Gill Stewart, the company's managing director, reiterated the importance of evolving alongside its clients. Co-Op has introduced more colors for its coffins and has started offering unconventional hearse options, like a fire truck or a double-decker red bus.
A recent study conducted by Co-Op, which involved 4,000 people in the U.K., found that 68 percent of participants see funerals as celebrations of life as opposed to somber occasions. Ms. Stewart said that it was important for families to have options at their funeral homes that reflect those beliefs.
Sparrow hosts events that reflect the evolving attitudes about funerals, like grief circles; a death-themed comedy show; guided meditations; and several death cafes, where people who are dying or coping with grief can eat pastries and connect. Exit Here, too, holds regular coffee gatherings for the bereaved.
Similar initiatives are underway at Poppy's, a funeral home the color of a clementine in South West London. An ad campaign for the company last year involved plastering tube stations around the city with posters that read: "1861 called. They want their funeral traditions back." The vehicles used by Poppy's to pick up the recently deceased are a soothing shade of lilac. They're also electric.
"Whatever you end up choosing or wanting for the funeral, you want to be treated like a human," said Poppy Mardall, 41, who worked for Sotheby's before pivoting to the mortuary business. You don't want to be "upsold on packages when you are grieving," she added.
The Price of Death
Of course, amid all this is the looming matter of cost. Mr. Wilson, for example, is using a "very nice" six-figure insurance payout, from a critical illness policy he took out a few years ago, to execute his funeral vision. "I'm extremely fortunate to have that money," he said.
But what all these places reiterate is that whatever the budget, they can typically make it work. "The perception, which drives me slightly mad, is that a place that looks nice will cost more," Mr. Peyton said.
In reality, personalized services do tend to come with a higher price tag -- but not always. For example, in addition to Exit Here's signature wooden coffin, which has a retail price of 1,950 pounds (about $ 2,500), there is also a biodegradable cardboard model that costs 570 pounds (about $ 730). As for the funerals themselves, prices are as extravagant as the service permits.
Last year, as found by the insurance company Sun Life in its long-running "Cost of Dying" report, the average cost of a "basic" funeral -- burial or cremation; funeral home fees; a midrange coffin; a limousine; and celebrant fees -- in London was 5,171 pounds (about $ 6,640).
In the U.S., according to a 2023 study conducted by the National Funeral Directors Association, the median cost for a funeral with a coffin and burial is $ 8,300 (then there is the burial plot itself, which can range from the hundreds to the tens of thousands, depending on the state and whether it's a public or private cemetery); if you choose cremation instead, that median cost comes down to $ 6,280.
Exit Here's pricing falls around that estimate, with an equivalent funeral starting at 5,819 pounds (about $ 7,500). At Poppy's, the cost is lower: A basic service starts at 4,448 pounds (about $ 5,700). And although it's not as stylish, Co-Op Funeralcare is even more affordable, with starter packages going for 3,900 pounds (about $ 5,000).
Growing the Clientele
Mortuaries, of course, will never lack for customers. But how do these modern homes attract business? Places like Exit Here rely mainly on word-of-mouth recommendations, largely because funerals tend to be private affairs. They aren't exactly shareable moments -- though that could be changing, too.
When Exit Here organized the funeral last year of Poppy Chancellor -- the artist and daughter of the "Downton Abbey" star Anna Chancellor -- who died at 36, guests shared photos of the "leaving party," as the service was called, on social media. Inside the West London crematory were big, beautiful banners emblazoned with slogans like "Embrace joy today" and "I want to see you dance again." In one video, guests were doing the limbo to the silky vocals and pulse of Beyoncé's hit song "Heated."
In 2024, the question of death is very much alive. And how we choose to answer it, well, that's a personal matter.

Full text: 'Call Me By Your Name' (2017)
Sometimes a movie can seem to meander, running on vibes and nostalgia, and then snap itself together with full emotional force in its closing passages. That's what happens in Luca Guadagnino's adaptation of the novel by André Aciman (with an Oscar-winning screenplay by James Ivory). Timothée Chalamet (right) is remarkable in the role of Elio, 17, a withdrawn young man who falls in love for the first time with a graduate student (Armie Hammer).
'Glengarry Glen Ross' (1992)
David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, about real estate salesmen and the desperate measures they'll take to keep their lousy jobs, was adapted into one of the most potent pictures of the 1990s, thanks to the force of Mamet's dialogue and one of the most remarkable ensemble casts of the era, including Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon and Ed Harris. It's something of a profanity-laden counterpart to "Death of a Salesman."
'Room' (2015)
Brie Larson won the Oscar for best actress for her astonishing work in this Lenny Abrahamson adaptation of the Emma Donoghue novel. She stars as Joy, who lives in captivity with her 5-year-old son -- a child conceived there after she was kidnapped as a teenager. Abrahamson sensitively details their daily routines and rituals as Joy patiently plans an escape.
'The Spectacular Now' (2013)
The staid conventions of high school movies -- reckless romance, nonstop partying, cheerful hedonism -- are rendered with atypical sensitivity in James Ponsoldt's 2013 adaptation of the young adult novel by Tim Tharp. Miles Teller is charming in the leading role as a popular senior whose good-time demeanor hides his alcoholism.
'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991)
Once upon a time, "The Terminator" was just a one-off sci-fi action flick -- a pulpy but highly profitable film that gave a big boost to its co-writer and director, James Cameron, and its star, Arnold Schwarzenegger. But it didn't scream "sequel," at least not until Cameron directed "Aliens" and figured out how to raise a sequel's stakes by amping up the scope and intensity. "T2" did that and then some.

Irish Rappers Know They Ruffle Feathers: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Kneecap's Irish nationalist rap has drawn ire from pro-British politicians and commentators. A new film dramatizing the group's story looks set to do the same.
"He gave me his wallet," joked D.J. Próvaí, a member of the Belfast-based rap trio Kneecap, to explain why the group trusted the British filmmaker Rich Peppiatt to tell their story.
Kneecap's blending of hip-hop beats with Irish-language rap lyrics championing republican politics -- seeking unity for the Ireland's north and south -- has won it fans on both sides of Ireland's internal border. The group has also drawn wrath from both British and Northern Irish politicians, who have accused it of inciting sectarianism. But this only made the trio a more attractive subject for his first scripted project, Peppiatt said, and "Kneecap" -- a riotous fictionalized retelling of the rappers' origins -- comes to U.S. theaters Friday.
"They deal with serious subjects in a hysterical way and made headlines for saying things that no one else seemed to be saying," Peppiatt said in an interview alongside two group members. Last year, Kneecap unveiled a cartoonlike mural in Belfast of a police vehicle on fire, accompanied by an anti-police message in Irish.
"They also played the media very well, drawing fire from the media and politicians, but always turning it to their own advantage," Peppiatt added.
A former journalist, Peppiatt resigned from the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Star in 2011 and then made the documentary "One Rogue Reporter" about unscrupulous newspaper editors. In the Kneecap lads, he found kindred rebellious spirits, and they were reassured by Peppiatt's own turbulent experience with the news media.
After first meeting with the trio, Peppiatt decided to learn Irish. The language is central to the latest iteration of a so-called Celtic revival, in which artists -- including Kneecap -- have interrogated Irish identity and culture. The dominance of the English language in Ireland is a legacy of British colonization, and "the fact that we spent day to day speaking a language that was almost driven out of existence is a political act," Mo Chara, a Kneecap member, said in a phone interview.
Even with Peppiatt's commitment to speak the same language, the Kneecap team was initially hesitant about having their lives and work turned into a movie, and had turned down inquiries from documentary-makers before. There was the risk a film would be cheesy, Mo Chara said, and could negatively impact Kneecap's career.
But in 2019, when Peppiatt proposed a narrative feature in which the trio would play fictionalized versions of themselves, they were intrigued. Two years later, Peppiatt directed the music video for the Kneecap track "Guilty Conscience," shot inside an empty church, as something of a creative test.
The director passed. "Rich was serious about this and not just using our story for his own benefit," said Móglaí Bap, whose onscreen father is played by the Irish actor Michael Fassbender.
To craft the screenplay for the film, Peppiatt and Kneecap met in pubs, where its members would share stories from their upbringings and reminisce about the group's early days. For the most part, the wildest tales onscreen are the closest to reality: Móglaí Bap's christening did take place at a sacred Catholic site as a British Army helicopter hovered overhead, and there the trio did once search for their supply of LSD inside a trash can.
"You need an outsider to pick through the garbage that is their life and try and find something of value," Peppiatt said, making the others in the room burst into laughter.
Danny Boyle's drug-fueled "Trainspotting" was a consistent reference during production, but for aesthetic inspiration, Peppiatt also looked to "Amélie," Jean-Pierre Jeunet's whimsical romance.
"I thought, 'I'm going to get my shot at making a film and I want it to feel stylistically distinct like 'Amélie,"' Peppiatt said. "I want to make those bold choices."
Once a week for about six months, the Kneecap trio had a session with the acting coach Kieran Lagan to become more comfortable in front of the camera. Their transition into acting was made easier by the film leaning into the humor that has characterized their onstage personas.
"In Ireland, we've always used comedy as a way of dealing with trauma," Móglaí Bap said. "There's nothing a good joke can't help."
D.J. Próvaí -- whose name is pronounced "Provie," like the common term for the Provisional Irish Republican Army, and who wears a balaclava in the colors of the Irish flag -- said he knew people expect irony from Kneecap, but that they might be surprised at the film's more emotional scenes. "Using our mother tongue as a method of communication brings in that femininity to the film," he said.
When "Kneecap" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, the British newspaper The Daily Mail ran an article expressing outrage that the production had received some public funding, noting that the band had "been accused of glorifying the I.R.A."
When the film is released in Britain in late August, the musicians expect their critics -- in the press and the British Parliament -- to once again call them anti-British, but they are used to this tactic, and the attention it brings.
"It's like those places where they have the wee fish that eat the dead skin off your feet," D.J. Próvaí said. "The politicians eat the skin off our toes and we're getting clean feet."

Adaptation Of Best Seller Provides Lift To Box Office: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The film, which cost $ 25 million to make, is on track to earn an estimated $ 50 million in North America on its opening weekend, analysts say.
Colleen Hoover's book "It Ends With Us" has been a fixture on the best-seller list for years. And now, the movie adaptation has become a smash at the box office. The $ 25 million film from Sony Pictures is on track to earn an estimated $ 50 million in the United States and Canada, box office analysts say.
Starring Blake Lively, the romance is based on Ms. Hoover's most popular book -- one that was initially released in 2016 but reappeared on the best-seller list in the midst of the pandemic in 2021 and has since spent some 140 weeks there. Buoyed by TikTok, the book, about a complicated love triangle with undertones of domestic violence, has sold 8 million copies and found fans worldwide.
The low-budget film comes at a time when there has been little in the marketplace geared to women, in contrast with last summer when "Barbie" earned $ 1.4 billion worldwide and became the highest-grossing film of the year. Sony took advantage of this dearth in the marketplace with a potent social media campaign that featured Ms. Lively, guest appearances by her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and the help of her friend Taylor Swift, who contributed the song "My Tears Ricochet" to the film and the trailer.
On Friday alone, the PG-13 rated film earned more than $ 24 million as audiences tuned in to see Ms. Lively play a florist with a challenging past who falls for a sexy, abusive neurosurgeon played by Justin Baldoni, who also directed the film. It took in another $ 13.7 million on Saturday and is projected to earn about $ 12 million on Sunday.
The film's performance is a welcome boost for the box office, which is still down some 16 percent since last year at this time.
"Pure romance is not a big performer at the box office, but occasionally the right story based on the right book comes along, and with a well-cast female lead the movie catches fire," said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. "That's happening here."
Reviews have been middling. The New York Times called it "fitfully diverting, at times touching, often ridiculous and, at 2 hours and 10 minutes, almost offensively long." Yet audiences are giving it high marks. The Rotten Tomatoes audience score is hovering at 94 percent positive and the exit score, as recorded by tracking service CinemaScore, is A-.
The film will just miss the No. 1 slot for the weekend with Mr. Reynolds's hit, "Deadpool vs. Wolverine," holding on for its third frame. The Marvel movie will soon cross the $ 500 million threshold.
Things weren't as rosy for the Lionsgate adaptation of the video game "Borderlands," which despite the star power of Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart and Jack Black, took in an estimated $ 8.8 million. It was a total misfire for the $ 115 million sci-fi comedy from the director Eli Roth.

For Blake Lively, A Chance to Act And Brand-Build: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The images onscreen are informed by the actress's offscreen businesses, making the movie a fascinating study in the uses of star power.
Blake Lively's hair is like a character unto itself in the new romantic drama "It Ends With Us."
Her thick mane shapeshifts with her role, Lily Bloom, a flower shop owner who falls in and out of love with an abusive neurosurgeon. Lively's hair, dyed a soft ginger, is artfully messy when she gets her hands dirty starting up the store. The camera follows a mass of buoyant curls when she struts into a party dressed to impress the man who will ultimately betray her. When she wakes up post-coitus, her hair is perfectly tousled. When she is sad, it droops as if by magic.
You could say Blake Lively's hair is a tool she uses to sell her performance, but her performance is also a tool she uses to sell her hair. Those who are impressed with her locks in "It Ends With Us" can learn from her Instagram that she recently debuted a line of hair-care products called Blake Brown. (Brown is her father's last name.)
In many ways "It Ends With Us" is a brand-building exercise for Lively. Yes, the film, directed by Justin Baldoni, is an adaptation of a popular novel, meant to lure fans of the best-selling author Colleen Hoover, but it also serves as an advertisement for the world of Lively -- not just her talent but her celebrity and her other significant role, mogul, making the film a fascinating study in the various forms star power can take.
On the most readily understandable level, "It Ends With Us" makes a convincing case for Lively as an actress. Her particular je ne sais quoi was evident back in the 2007 pilot of "Gossip Girl," which opened with a tribute to her allure. Her character -- Serena van der Woodsen, the rich girl with a troubled past -- arrives at Grand Central, back in New York after a mysterious absence, and everyone turns toward her. As she looks around the train station's vast hall, she looks gorgeous and wistful, every flip of her hair (that hair!) seems imbued with greater meaning.
Like every young star on that prime-time soap, Lively made a bid for a film career. "Green Lantern" (2011) didn't win her a franchise, but it did introduce her to her future husband, Ryan Reynolds. The dark comedy "A Simple Favor" (2018), in which she played a martini-stirring psychopath, was a surprise box office success and garnered a fervent enough fan base to earn a sequel. But Lively seemed to struggle to find her niche in movies, and while she received some praise for performances in the romance "The Age of Adaline" (2015) and the survival thriller "The Shallows" (2016), nothing propelled her to the next level of fame on the big screen.
And yet Lively has long telegraphed her ambitions beyond acting. In 2014 she started Preserve, a lifestyle website that shilled expensive artisanal products and seemed like a folksier attempt at a Gwyneth Paltrow-esque Goop expansion. It was quickly shuttered, but she has continued to expand her reach in other ways. In addition to the hair products, she also founded the beverage labels Betty Buzz and Betty Booze, one with alcohol and one without; Betty, a family name, is also the name of one of her children with Reynolds.
Both Reynolds and motherhood are a key part of the Lively image. She presents herself as a doting mom to her four children, just as Lily ultimately is to her daughter in "It Ends With Us." On the red carpet, she told E! that Reynolds wrote a scene in the film, which has a screenplay credited to Christy Hall. It's a comment that has fueled rumors of on-set drama involving Baldoni, but also furthers the notion that the marriage is a team business.
Reynolds himself is something of a master of shameless cross-promotion. Players from Wrexham A.F.C., the soccer team Reynolds co-owns, cameo in his superhero blockbuster "Deadpool & Wolverine." Fans of that movie can also buy limited-edition bottles of Aviation Gin, another Reynolds enterprise. But whereas Reynolds's big summer hit offers plenty of opportunities to break the fourth wall and shout out its star's real-life interests -- that's Deadpool's whole deal -- "It Ends With Us" is a different beast. Lively is not playing a character who knows she's in a movie played by Blake Lively, she's portraying a woman in a state of emotional turmoil.
Plenty of other actors have side hustles -- George Clooney has tequila, Scarlett Johansson, skin care -- but rarely do these intersect so explicitly with their onscreen work. Lively doesn't seem to separate her acting career from her other efforts. She's pulling double duty promoting both with a pop-up store in New York called Betty Blooms, where she posed in front of a sign for "fresh flowers & fizzy refreshments." A promotional email explained how to make "It Ends With Us"-inspired cocktails using Betty Buzz. One recipe called for Reynolds's gin. It's a cheery gimmick that seems awkwardly out of step with the context of the film itself, which tells the story of a woman dealing with domestic violence.
Lively has infused a little bit of herself into every aspect of the film. The look of Lily's store evokes the earthy but pricey ideals that were once highlighted on Preserve. And then there's the use of Taylor Swift's "My Tears Ricochet" during a pivotal moment, a reminder that Lively is close friends with one of the most powerful pop stars in the world. It's a music cue that immediately takes us out of the story and reminds us just who Lively is and the kind of influence she wields.
"It Ends With Us" does give Lively a chance to act -- and she's often quite good at it. As Lily, she is captivating, the kind of performer who seems to flirt with the camera, drawing the whole audience into her orbit. You see why people fall in love with her onscreen. But the performance is almost beside the point. Lively has transformed the project into film-as-commerce. It's a savvy bit of persona curation that might not be particularly cinematic, but is perhaps Lively's masterpiece.

Beautiful People Suffer But Avert Messy Reality: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Blake Lively plays Lily Bloom, a flower lover with a thorny personal garden, in this gauzy adaptation of Colleen Hoover's best-selling novel.
Buried under the gauzy romanticism of "It Ends With Us" -- under the softly diffused visuals, the endless montage sequences, the sensitive mewling on the soundtrack and the luxuriously coifed thickets of Blake Lively's sunset-on-Malibu-Beach dyed-red hair -- is a tough little movie about women, bad choices, worse men and decisions that doesn't fit into a tidy box.
Lively stars as the improbably named Lily Blossom Bloom, a beauty with a traumatic history, a soulful ex and a passion for gardening. Over the course of the movie, she falls in love with a neurosurgeon who looks like he stepped out of a Calvin Klein ad. She also befriends a wisecracking sidekick, opens a whimsical floral shop, endures heartache and, after much reflection and many plot complications, finds herself. It's hard going, but Lily takes whatever life throws at her with her meticulously styled head up and a neo-bohemian influencer vibe. She's a dream of a woman, an aspirational ideal, an Instagram-era Mildred Pierce.
You may know Mildred from Turner Classic Movies as the pie-baking survivor played by Joan Crawford in the 1945 noir "Mildred Pierce." Mildred walks into that classic wearing a mink coat with linebacker shoulder-pads and the kind of stricken look that clouds a woman's face when she discovers that her no-good second husband is sleeping with her no-good teenage daughter, and the brat has just offed the creep. It's no wonder that when Mildred stares into the nighttime waters of the Pacific, she seems to be mulling her equally dark past and future, much as Lily does one evening on a Boston rooftop early on in "It Ends With Us."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Lily doesn't have long to consider her existential options because her rooftop reveries are soon interrupted by the neurosurgeon, Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni, who directed the movie). A brooding hunk with soft eyes, hard muscles and miraculously unchanging three-day stubble, Ryle has a touch of menace and a gift for cornball lines, and before long he and Lily are flirtatiously circling each other. Love buds and, yes, blooms, and Lily settles down with Ryle. He seems like a ready-made catch (Baldoni gives himself plenty of close-ups), although anyone at all familiar with the conventions of romantic fiction will wonder about the intensity of his attentions. A picture-perfect guy doesn't necessarily make a picture-perfect life, dig?
Adapted from Colleen Hoover's best seller by Christy Hall, "It Ends With Us" is fitfully diverting, at times touching, often ridiculous and, at 2 hours and 10 minutes, almost offensively long. It's visually and narratively overbusy, stuffed with flashbacks of Lily as an adolescent (Isabela Ferrer) that create two parallel lines of action. As the adult Lily moves forward with Ryle and opens her store -- she gets help from a nattering assistant, Allysa (Jenny Slate), who enters with her luxury bag swinging and motormouth running -- images of the past fill in Lily's history and her high-school romance with another student, Atlas. (Alex Neustaedter plays him as a teen, while Brandon Sklenar steps into the grown-up role.)
Even the kitschiest romances have a way of sinking their hooks into you, and so it is here, at least intermittently. Love stories work on us because love does, with the bonus that watching beautiful people suffer beautifully is a reason movies were invented. Lively is eminently suited to this task and has some strong moments, but she's often ill-served by the filmmaking. The flashbacks add information, yet they also pull you away from the adult Lily, which fragments Lively's performance and drains the slow-building momentum of her scenes. Just as unfortunately, Baldoni prettifies everything -- trees, cityscapes, people -- to the point that each detail, pose and smile seems lifted from a lifestyle ad instead of true, messy reality.
The most interesting thing about "It Ends With Us" is how it at once deploys romantic conventions and tries to wiggle around the more regressive aspects of those conventions. Finding a balance between these elements is tricky, and partly a reason that persuasive romances are so hard to pull off now. One obvious issue is that women who have actual choices -- women who are straight or Sapphic or queer, who marry or don't, who have children or cats or both -- don't easily or reflexively fit into tired Hollywood-style formulas. With her trauma and therapeutic epiphanies, her sparkly boots and Carhartt coveralls, Lily seems thoroughly modern, but she's trapped in a story whose sell-by date has expired.
It Ends With Us
Rated PG-13 for domestic violence, some language and discreet lovemaking. Running time: 2 hours 10 minutes. In theaters.

CVS Revises Its Forecasts
As Health Plan Costs Rise
CVS Health chopped its 2024 forecast for a third time this year and changed the leadership of its health insurance business where it is struggling with rising costs.
Karen Lynch, the chief executive, will lead the insurance segment, replacing the executive vice president, Brian Kane, who is leaving the company, the health care giant said on Wednesday.
Rising claims from the company's Medicare Advantage coverage have hurt CVS Health for much of this year and contributed to repeated trims of its outlook for 2024. Medicare Advantage plans are privately run versions of the federal government's program for people ages 65 and older.
CVS Health also said Wednesday that it has been hurt by a drop in quality ratings for those plans and pressure from the coverage it manages in several states.
The company's adjusted operating income from its health benefits business plunged 39 percent in the quarter. Associated Press
ENTERTAINMENT
Sony Reports 6.5% Jump
In Profit Last Quarter
Sony's profit rose 6.5 percent in the last quarter on robust demand for its video games, films and music, the Japanese electronics and entertainment company said on Wednesday. Tokyo-based Sony's profit in the April-June quarter totaled 231.6 billion yen, or $ 1.6 billion, up from 217 billion yen, it said.
Quarterly sales edged up 1.6 percent to 3 trillion yen as Sony's entertainment business remained strong, although its financial services lagged.
Sony officials said global demand for its animation offerings like "Demon Slayer" was strong on streaming services like Amazon Prime. The partnership with the streaming service Crunchyroll was proving extremely successful, Sony said.
Hiroki Totoki, chief financial officer and president, promised to leverage Sony's powerful offerings that are rooted in the diversity of its workers and creators. Associated Press
TRANSPORTATION
Shares of Lyft Nose-Dive
Despite Profitable Report
Lyft shares tumbled to their biggest loss in more than a year on Wednesday after the ride-hailing app reported gross bookings that spooked investors.
Shares of Lyft were down close to 13 percent in midday trading to $ 9.54, even as the San Francisco company turned in its first quarterly profit, earning $ 5 million.
Lyft reported gross bookings for the second quarter at the low end of its forecast range of $ 4 billion to $ 4.1 billion. It's projecting the same range for the third quarter, which came in below Wall Street analysts' forecasts of $ 4.15 billion. Lyft defines gross bookings as the total dollar value of transactions invoiced to ride-share riders including taxes, tolls and fees but excluding tips. It also includes amounts billed for other offerings, including bike rentals.
Lyft's results came a day after a strong earnings report from its rival, Uber, sent that company's shares up more than 10 percent. Associated Press

Full text: "Pop Culture Jeopardy!" is expected to begin production in August and will stream only on Amazon Prime Video.
If you have enjoyed Colin Jost's dispatches from Tahiti for the Olympics surfing events and are hoping to see more of him, you're in luck: On Wednesday, Sony Pictures Television announced that he will be host of the new game show "Pop Culture Jeopardy!"
Jost, 42, is a veteran writer for "Saturday Night Live" and has anchored its Weekend Update segment since 2014 alongside Michael Che. "Pop Culture Jeopardy!" -- a spinoff of the juggernaut "Jeopardy!," which has run for decades on broadcast TV and in syndication -- will stream only on Amazon Prime Video.
Jost was selected for his "sharp wit and intelligence," Suzanne Prete, president for game shows at Sony Pictures Television, which produces the show, said in a news release. "He's smart and quick, like our contestants, and we know he'll be able to keep up with them while making this new series his own."
"What is: I'm excited," Jost said in the statement, riffing on the "Jeopardy!" answer format.
In the pop culture version of the show, contestants will play in teams of three in tournament-style events, racing to answer questions in a variety of categories like alternative rock, the Avengers and Broadway. Production of the show is expected to begin in August.
The spinoff is part of a yearslong expansion of the "Jeopardy!"-verse, as the show's producers have called it, which will also include special tournaments. The flagship show also has seen plenty of change since Alex Trebek, who had hosted "Jeopardy!" for 37 years, died in 2020. A lengthy, revolving host audition resulted in Mike Richards, then the show's executive producer, being chosen to host, only to be pushed aside after revelations that he had made offensive comments on a podcast. Then the role was shared between the actor Mayim Bialik and the former "Jeopardy!" champion Ken Jennings until last year, when Bialik announced that she had been removed from the show. Jennings has since settled in as the sole host.

Full text: 'The Woman King' (Aug. 12)
Gina Prince-Bythewood has pulled off an unusual career 180 in recent years, pivoting gracefully from small-scale dramas to action extravaganzas like "The Old Guard" and this, its 2022 follow-up. Viola Davis (right) is unforgettable as Nanisca, the 19th-century general of an all-woman warrior army in the African kingdom of Dahomey. The screenplay, penned by Dana Stevens (with story assistance from the actor Maria Bello), is based on a true story.
'Paddington' (Aug. 13)
Nicole Kidman has played only a handful of outright villains in her prolific career, but when she does, she does so with gusto. In this 2014 adaptation by the director Paul King, Kidman appears as an evil museum taxidermist who wants nothing more than to stuff the gentle cartoon bear of the title. It's a delightfully wild performance, with just the right mixture of menace and camp.
'Burn After Reading' (Aug. 31)
The Coen brothers followed up their Oscar-winning western "No Country For Old Men" with this wild slapstick comedy. John Malkovich stars as Osborne Cox, an unemployed C.I.A. analyst, whose attempt to skewer his bosses with a tell-all backfires broadly, pulling in a philandering lawman (George Clooney), Cox's fed-up wife (Tilda Swinton) and two brainless gym employees (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt).
'Liar Liar' (Aug. 31)
This 1997 smash comedy reteamed Jim Carrey with Tom Shadyac, who directed Carrey's breakout feature, "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." Carrey is Fletcher Reede, a fast-talking lawyer whose son wishes on his birthday that his dad must spend a day telling only the truth. It works, not only causing Reede professional issues but wrecking even the simplest interactions.
'Miami Vice' (Aug. 31)
Michael Mann played a big part in defining '80s cool with the hit cop series "Miami Vice," for which he was an executive producer. He never wrote or directed an episode, but he does both for this 2006 film. It's a movie that's all about vibes and style, dropping viewers into its relentless action. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx smolder as the cops Crockett and Tubbs. JASON BAILEY

Full text: Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure is full of solutions that slide and stump. Play follow the leader in Flock, and take on bulbous hordes in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess.
The typically slow summer release schedule for video games has been enlivened by Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure, Flock and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which offer intriguing mechanics while showcasing the need for a healthy community.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure
Arranger is helmed by a veteran team, including the artist David Hellman, who worked on the important time-manipulation offering Braid. They've formed the studio Furniture & Mattress, seemingly to fricassee the brain.
With smatterings of humor, the writer Nick Suttner has created a powerful narrative around young Jemma, a brown-haired protagonist with an oversize green coat that covers her hands. She feels like an outcast in her hometown and wants to move beyond its imposing gates.
Each level is represented by a grid, and setting Jemma on her adventurous path requires sliding panels in every direction -- left, right, up, down and around. Dealing with the puzzles alone would confound players, so the strong writing provides needed rest from the difficult solutions.
The dialogue is tight and even the insults are clean. One character's way of using foul language is to call Jemma "a rotten turnip." There's a tendency to use groan-worthy puns, but the characters she meets range from the playful to the acerbic. Similar to the recent Hauntii, nearly all of them tell Jemma not to leave, because they feel safe exactly where they are -- but she's born to run. Is simply feeling safe really living?
Initially, Arranger is admirably subversive in its pursuit of individuality over a community's ingrained paranoia. Yet soon Jemma realizes she can't move forward against pesky robotic birds without the help of quirky townspeople. She's single-minded but open-minded, not an obstinate hermit.
Jemma's wanderlust won't quit, and solving the puzzles ultimately leads her to new locales. It's hard to adapt to the reasoning of these sliding puzzles because sometimes moving Jemma away from an entrance eventually leads the way there. There is consternation, the pain of failure and then the confidence gained from a correct deduction.
In places, the puzzles in this eight-hour game can be even more compelling than the narrative. Sheep can be shorn by moving a panel displaying scissors onto them. You can drag a sword into an area blocked by a dragon and bump the sharp object against the beast so that, poof, it disappears in purple smoke. One monster can be felled by moving its body so the thing attacks itself in ouroboros fashion.
To think that all of this is accomplished by moving squares around proves there's an ingenuity present in Arranger that may ultimately make it one of the year's standout indie games.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Flock
Flock begins with so much positivity and good cheer that I felt I was visiting a fantasy world whose golden rule is "Welcome with kindness." I boarded the back of a long-beaked bird as if it were a dragon and flapped to the Uplands to find Aunt Jane, a zoology professor. She asked me to find scores of avian wonders, none of which attack one another.
There's a Pokémon-style "catch 'em all" aspect to such searching that on first blush might seem like an overdone trope. But you're a bird watcher, too, as you discover bewls, baffins and burbots (which look like giant, flat polliwogs and are so thin they "could give you a nasty paper cut").
The 60 fanciful animals in this six-hour game are made in an appealingly bright child-art style. A bioluminescent thrip is only a head with helicopter-like wings atop. You can also add up to 30 soaring creatures to your flock. In the artist Richard Hogg's vivid world, sheep can travel with your flock sans wings. Shear them and trade the wool for a tam or balaclava at the Wandering Wardrober's shop.
Yes, there could be more game here. I imagined quests in underground caves for batlike entities, or ascending high into the heavens to catch a fluttering creature near deep space. Yet it almost doesn't matter.
I took time to watch the sun rise, which turned the landscape into shades of breathtaking violet, and later gazed at a crescent moon rising in the star-filled sky. The chill music, sometimes enhanced by a delicate marimba, the drone of cicadas and the chirping flock, took me away from the honking rush-hour traffic below my window.
Flock, by Hollow Ponds, the studio behind Wilmot's Warehouse, has a vibe of relaxation achieved through observation, perhaps because you're not really imprisoning creatures. You've charmed them with a combination of bird whistles and careful movement, approaching silently enough so as not to frighten them. As dozens trail behind your flock, colorful as Jelly Bellys with wings, you are them and they are you and you are all together in this alluring ecosystem.

Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess
After playing a demo, I was told that if Monster Hunter Wilds is Capcom's upcoming blockbuster, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is its art house offering.
The introduction certainly wasn't as violently epic as, say, Halo Infinite. Instead, it showed the flowing, dancing goddess Yoshiro, perhaps creating a spell based on ancient Japanese myth. "The rage and torrent of this world is unending," says a doom-filled narrator. The villagers covet peace after their Mount Kafuku is overrun by grotesque, damaging beings.
Soh, Yoshiro's armor-clad guardian, does much of the fighting. After battles, Yoshiro opens a gate, which magically restores normalcy to the village. So goes each chapter.
The battle style is somewhat akin to Capcom's long-running Devil May Cry series, in which hordes are slain. Attacking the Seethe -- bulbous, slurping crawlers with their long tongues hanging out in exaggerated pug-style -- is satisfying. But there's a strategy element here, too: Asking villagers you've freed to help in grim battle is just a fair trade.
While Path of the Goddess is both beautiful and steeped in Japanese legend, there is too much to manage over its 20 hours. I needed to level up the villagers, choose their powers and place them in strategic locations to attack. These tower defense mechanics added complexity I didn't expect. I also had to put villagers to work to fix town infrastructure, like a water source the Seethe had damaged. This felt like labor for me, not just for the villagers.
Brilliant, lurid little things kept me going to the end. Swords slashed in a psychedelic crescent animation of red, orange and blue as weaker Seethe perished with sounds that evoked moaning frogs. When Yoshiro purified a gate, fireworks rained down like a supernatural storm. Near the end, inspired by Florian Walter's experimental sax solo that's reminiscent of Anthony Braxton's work, I battled Yatsukahagi, an arachnid-like boss with legs ending in sharpened, yellowed fingernails.
Eventually, calm comes over the mountain and the townspeople gather to commiserate. As in Arranger and Flock, harmony is restored not just because of the courage of Yoshiro and Soh courage, but because a community banded together. In other words, it (still) takes a village.
Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure was reviewed on the Switch and is also available on the PC, PlayStation 5 and smartphones through a Netflix subscription. Flock and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess were reviewed on the PlayStation 5 and are also available on the PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S.

Full text: The superhero sequel was on pace to collect about $ 200 million at North American theaters over the weekend, a record opening for an R-rated movie.
Marvel Studios, trying to move past a pair of box office humiliations, deployed two of its most popular characters over the weekend and hit a mother lode.
The potty-mouthed Deadpool and hard-drinking Wolverine -- packaged together for the first time on movie screens -- were on pace to sell roughly $ 205 million in tickets in the United States and Canada, box office analysts said on Sunday. "Deadpool & Wolverine" will easily set a record for the largest R-rated movie opening in Hollywood history, even when adjusting for inflation. The current record-holder, "Deadpool" (2016), arrived to more than $ 175 million in today's dollars.
"Deadpool & Wolverine" was expected to collect an additional $ 233 million overseas, for a global total after only three and a half days of play of roughly $ 438 million -- a start on par with Marvel's "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" (2022), which went on to sell about $ 1 billion in tickets.
Directed by Shawn Levy, "Deadpool & Wolverine" cost an estimated $ 320 million to make and market worldwide.
Marvel badly needed a win. Two of its releases last year, "The Marvels" and "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania," disappointed at the box office, ending an unbroken 15-year winning streak for the boutique studio and beginning a period of intense Wall Street scrutiny. Marvel's weakness played a role in proxy battles for Disney board seats earlier this year. (In the end, Disney fended off the activist investors, including Nelson Peltz, a founder of Trian Partners, and Ike Perlmutter, the former chairman of Marvel Entertainment.)
Superheroes are not the sure things they used to be. DC Studios, part of Warner Bros. Discovery, is working on its fourth reboot strategy in eight years following disappointments like "The Flash," "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom," and "Blue Beetle." Sony has struggled with "Spider-Man" spinoffs like "Madame Web" and "Morbius." The problem is that the movie and television marketplace is awash in the characters, and some of the most popular ones have already been fully exploited (at least for now).
"Over the next few years, hopefully Marvel and DC can launch one or two big new series to sustain the genre," said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. "Superheroes play well in all markets around the world. They're extremely important to the business."
Marvel movie plots have grown increasingly convoluted, at least for casual viewers. "Deadpool & Wolverine" has something to do with a "sacred timeline" and "anchor beings" and a "metaphysical graveyard" called the Void. ("Good luck if you're coming in with no prior knowledge," David Sims, a critic for The Atlantic, wrote in his review.) But "Deadpool & Wolverine" was mostly built as a love letter to Marvel fans -- an effort to show die-hards that the studio had rediscovered its mojo.
In one scene, Ryan Reynolds, who plays Deadpool, looks directly at the screen and says, "Nerds, it's about to get good." A bloody battle between Deadpool and Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, commences.
Ticket buyers gave "Deadpool & Wolverine" an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls. About 97 percent of fan reviews on RottenTomatoes.com, a review-aggregation site, were positive; only one Marvel movie, "Spider-Man: No Way Home," has ever scored better by that measure.
To support the movie's release, Disney sent Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Jackman on an overseas publicity tour that stopped in China, South Korea, Brazil, Germany and the United Kingdom. Perhaps to telegraph that this is not a movie for children, or perhaps because they simply felt like it, the stars peppered their public comments with expletives. (Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, was comparatively restrained, posting on Instagram that it was "one heck of a fun film!" Disney doesn't often release R-rated movies.)
Alan Bergman, the co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, has now delivered three hits for the company in a row -- a major turnaround from last summer, when Disney sputtered with "The Marvels," the disastrous "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" and a dead-on-arrival "Haunted Mansion." This year, along with "Deadpool & Wolverine," Disney has had "Inside Out 2," with $ 1.5 billion in ticket sales, and "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes," with about $ 400 million.

Rap Act That Boomed All by Itself: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The rap duo's raw songs and festival-like touring strategy has paid off: Its latest album opened at No. 5 without traditional industry strategies or support.
The Louisiana rap duo Suicideboys have avoided nearly all the trappings of the contemporary music machine. They rarely grant interview requests and make the occasional public appearance with their faces partially covered. Still, Scott Arceneaux Jr. (known as Scrim) and Aristos Petrou (a.k.a. Ruby da Cherry) recently celebrated their biggest opening week on the Billboard chart yet: a No. 5 debut for their fourth album, "New World Depression," last month.
"It's kind of hard, dude," Arceneaux, 35, said of dealing with their ever-growing visibility as one of the biggest independent rap groups in the United States. "It's taken on a life of its own."
Over the last decade, a passionate and adoring fan base has been drawn to Suicideboys' blend of Southern rap rhythms and pop-punk melodies, all cloaked in the lush, depressive fog of internet-native hip-hop. They became underground heroes by making raw music about triggering subjects, which they relentlessly promoted on their own until their fan base snowballed into a force the music industry couldn't ignore.
In 2021, on the strength of an audience they'd bootstrapped since 2014, they signed an eight-figure distribution deal with the Orchard, a Sony Music subsidiary, that was re-upped last year. Their semiannual Grey Day Tour -- a mini-festival that's featured similarly ascendant peers like the hardcore band Turnstile and the Florida rap aesthete Denzel Curry -- has catapulted them onto the list of rap's highest-grossing touring acts, taking in over $ 42 million and selling 431,000 tickets in 2023.
Video chatting on the day of their new album's release, the pair were nestled in a room speckled with soundproofing materials at one of their properties deep in the Florida panhandle, their home outside of New Orleans. Petrou, with waves of dark hair cascading from under a backward baseball cap, spoke casually and with curiosity, positioned in the background, while Arceneaux often sat half-profile at the forefront, slightly bowing his bowl-cut mullet when he wasn't speaking thoughtfully about their journey so far.
As cousins who grew up separately in the greater Louisiana area before coming together in New Orleans, Arceneaux and Petrou described their upbringings as chaotic. "Childhood was rough," Arceneaux admitted. "There was always drama," Petrou agreed. "Our parents would get into it. We've always remained close and very rarely let the family dynamic infect our relationship."
They both barreled through adolescence -- taking on dead-end jobs, selling and using drugs, and worshiping at the altars of Southern rap legends like Lil Wayne and Three 6 Mafia -- before Petrou took an interest in Arceneaux's burgeoning career as a D.J. and beatmaker and reached out after getting tired of working with people in local punk bands: "I was like, 'Dude, I could link up with my cousin."'
The pair came up with the name for their label, G*59 (it references Highway 59, which runs through New Orleans), a year before they set forth into the rap world as Suicideboys. When they decided to get serious about music, they made a pact that their name gestures to, which has become essential to understanding the group's lore: Become successful musicians by the age of 30, or else.
"We said, 'This is a when, not an if,"' Petrou said.
Darkness, addiction and the language of suicide -- a delicate subject they sang and rapped about in a plain-spoken, relatable manner -- became embedded in the group's identity and iconography. (Their name is styled with dollar signs, rather than the letter S.) "They're super vulnerable," the Atlanta rapper and G*59 signee Germ, who's known the duo since meeting them after a 2015 performance in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview. "Everybody else is vulnerable, but nobody's going to talk about it, so they're braver than most."
As the group's early aesthetic mutated across myriad EPs, one-off singles and mixtapes, Suicideboys embraced a relentless tack to self-promotion: handing out mixtapes at Louisiana State University, constantly emailing rap publications and collaborating with other web-friendly artists. The hard work paid off and their fans stuck with them, forming the kind of bonds that arise when listeners see their rawest emotions and most terrifying thoughts reflected back at them.
"They haven't been afraid to tackle issues that are important to the youth," said the veteran tour manager Kevin Lyman, whose long-running Warped Tour was such a direct inspiration for Grey Day's festival-circuit approach that Suicideboys almost called it "Worpt Tour" before being convinced otherwise by lawyers. "I would've been happy if they did," Lyman said and chuckled during a phone call, before rhapsodizing about the pull that the duo have on their audience: "I don't think they've tried to be anything more than what they are."
That mining of emotional vulnerability -- a warts-and-all approach to discussing substance abuse and suicidal ideation that, to the uninitiated, can come across as aggressive and off-putting -- has resulted in intense fan interactions. Petrou recounted meeting a young woman at a 2016 show in Russia who revealed cuts indicating self-harm across both of her arms. "I grabbed her arm and I kissed it," he said with deep sympathy, "and I said, 'Stop doing this, please. Stop hurting yourself."'
Both Petrou and Arceneaux are in various stages of recovery from substance abuse, including heroin. Petrou has been clean for nearly four years (he said he still uses cannabis); Arceneaux celebrated his five-year sober anniversary earlier this year. Both relapsed in 2015 during a creative session that resulted in the submerged, aching ballad "Low Key."
"We made this really sad song about how we felt on the inside, and it felt so good," Petrou said in regards to the resulting emotional catharsis.
Now that both have embraced sobriety, the group is cautious not to proselytize to an audience that comes to them for a release from their own personal pain. "A lot of our fans haven't gotten to that point yet," Petrou said. He called their Suicideboys personas "the Tyler Durdens of our real selves," a reference to the anarchic alter ego in "Fight Club." "We don't want them to necessarily feel abandoned -- like, 'We saw the light, good luck on your own.' We still try to dive back into what we felt years ago. We were miserable, and we didn't realize the drugs were a big part of what was making us miserable."
Throughout their ups and downs, Suicideboys have focused on retaining control over how their music is made and distributed, which has been essential to staying true to themselves. "Everything that we can do as independently as we can, we do it," Petrou said, noting that they do still have to play ball with touring behemoths AEG and Live Nation when it comes to booking events like Grey Day. Otherwise, "Labels don't see a share of our profits, and we don't really work with other artists. You're not going to see us at the V.M.A.s. Scott and I just keep to ourselves."
When they have crossed paths with the conventional music industry, they've rankled the powers that be. Offered a chance to fly a flag of their choice atop Los Angeles's famous Capitol Records tower, the group requested an unprintable song title referencing their distaste for the music industry itself. The offer was quickly rescinded.
Arceneaux regards the music business -- artists, labels, awards committees, the whole lot -- as "a little too narcissistic for our taste." "We never wanted to rely on anybody for anything," he explained. "We've had enough experience to know that was no good." Petrou said he wouldn't name any names, but when it comes to the current pop landscape and the machine that keeps it moving, "a lot of them seem a little too full of themselves." He added, "At the end of the day, you have a lot of people that make you ask yourself, 'Why am I doing this?"'
One answer is the fans that have supported them throughout the years, becoming a core part of the group's life in the process. In a constantly changing speech that Arceneaux has made during every Suicideboys concert since getting sober, he recounts his struggles and emphasizes that even when awash in life's lowest points, "There's hope that life can get better."
"I never had no one that I looked up to who were like, 'Actually, bro, it doesn't have to be like that,"' he said. Petrou added, "I get told literally by everyone that we meet that as a fan, 10 times out of 10, that we saved their life." He reflected on the clearly unmeasurable impact Suicideboys have on their listeners: "It's such a heavy statement, and we get told it so often that both of us completely deflect it. We say, 'Well, thank you, because you saved our lives too."'

Going Their Own Way
Two more acts who have followed unconventional paths to building loyal fandoms.
WHO King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, a Melbourne, Australia-based psych-rock sextet formed in 2010, fronted by the multi-instrumentalist Stu Mackenzie.
THE VIBE A catalog that refuses to be pinned down to any single genre. One album may give off Tame Impala aesthetics (the Moog-heavy "The Silver Cord" from last year), while its predecessor, "PetroDragonic Apocalypse," is a thrash-heavy metal record akin to early Mastodon. The group has made pastoral folk pop ("Paper Mâché Dream Balloon" from 2015), and fuzzier, psychedelic garage and surf rock ("Willoughby's Beach" from 2011). When you're listening to "the Gizz," the only constant is change. "Every single record is reflective of whatever phase of life we're in, whatever made us creatively most inspired at the time," Mackenzie said in an interview.
The band's lyrics are frequently socially conscious, often tackling the dangers of environmental collapse and dominant figures in the media industry. Threads of cosmic existentialism, doom and longing for escape are often intertwined with inspiring messages of hope and a desire to change the world for the better.
HOW DID THEY RISE? Through sheer force of will. The group has put out 25 studio albums over 14 years, plus more than a dozen live albums, compilations, remixes, boxed sets and some 60 videos. That prolific output, combined with relentless global touring, gave rise to a rabid fan base around the world that has created avid online communities on Reddit and Discord to dissect lyrics, thematically connected albums and intricate song structures.
Fans love the untraditional approach Mackenzie and his crew have taken to putting out records. One (now former) member of the band started his own label in 2012 to put out King Gizzard's early releases after failing to gain attention in the industry, and the group has bootlegged many of its own live shows and put them online for download. In 2017, when the band released its 12th studio album, "Polygondwanaland," it put its master recordings online and encouraged record labels to produce their own vinyl copies of the album for free. Hundreds of independent releases of the LP are said to exist, though even the band does not know the definitive number.
WHO Viagra Boys, a six-piece rock outfit out of Stockholm formed in 2015, fronted by the American-born tattoo artist turned musician Sebastian Murphy.
THE VIBE Pummeling post-punk fused with jazz and synthesizers, undergirded by groove-forward bass lines and Murphy's guttural, Nick Cave-meets-Tom Waits baritone. Much of their early work has all the trappings of classic punk themes: drug-fueled binges, antisocial behavior, why they can't get their act together -- or, in "Common Sense," at least clean the broken glass off their apartment floor. But unlike much of punk and hardcore, Viagra Boys eschew the familiar thrash of lead guitars for swirling saxophones and siren-like synths. Albums like "Street Worms" from 2018 are sprinkled with surrealist, spoken-word narratives and mini skits; the track "Best in Show" features Murphy describing an intergalactic cocker spaniel taking home the top prize. His world building is often dark and weird, which is exactly what works for the band's absurdist tone and finger-in-the-eye class consciousness.
HOW DID THEY RISE? In 2018 they had a breakout moment with "Sports," a self-conscious critique on hypermasculinity that spirals into a screaming fit of repetition -- "Baseball, basketball, wiener dog." New fans began buying up loads of vinyl and merch at their raucous tours in Europe and the United States.
They've also built an entire world of wacky lore across YouTube, where their fictitious hypercapitalist company, Shrimptech Enterprises, puts out "research chemicals" for customers while its executives spend their riches on online gambling and cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes. And they've leaned into their native knowledge of social media, posting their way to fame with tongue-in-cheek memes and late-night Instagram Stories sessions of Magic: The Gathering card games.
"People thought that we were just kind of freaks online," Murphy said in an interview. "But I think we like to take a guerrilla-style approach to it, and to how we approached shows and touring in general. It's been very D.I.Y. from the beginning."

Bending Music History to His Will: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There is a passage in Serge Koussevitzky's final recording of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony that some listeners might hear in horror, but others with a degree of awe.
He recorded the piece in 1949 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, during the last weeks of his 25 years as its music director. About two minutes from the end of the first movement, the symphony is doing its best to keep calm. Flutes and clarinets arc gently, then oboes and horns; the cellos and basses stay constant beneath the nervous skittering of the other strings.
But then the bass begins to pull down. Suddenly the higher strings start to dominate, as anxiety takes hold; that sinking bass becomes inescapable. Tchaikovsky asks for a crescendo. Koussevitzky gives him that, but he also accelerates dramatically into the darkness, as fateful motifs blare. A few seconds later, just as the music seems ready to meet its destiny, Koussevitzky decides to make us wait. Fanfares blaze, entirely out of tempo, only to announce an unwritten silence. And then, savagery. As Tchaikovsky himself described this coda, "no haven exists."
This is the kind of moment that, in the wrong hands, gives Tchaikovsky a bad name. Koussevitzky was hardly alone in taking liberties with the composer, but many other conductors have at least tried to contain the drama here, rather than let hysteria hang out. Even Wilhelm Furtwängler, who like Koussevitzky sought to follow the spirit implied in a score as much as its explicit text, stayed truer to what Tchaikovsky actually wrote.
But in Koussevitzky's hands, the effect is shattering. This Tchaikovsky Fourth is irresistible evidence of just how much he and the Boston Symphony achieved in their quarter of a century together. Conviction resounds. The playing is virtuosic, yet not for the sake of display. Every phrase sings. There is formidable power and intensity, but also enough elegance that it feels apt for the writer Harris Goldsmith to have described the Boston strings as "one of the hedonistic delights of Western civilization." In 1944, the New York Times critic Olin Downes said that Koussevitzky had refined his orchestra into "the most highly perfected and sensitized symphony ensemble in the world."
Many of Koussevitzky's contemporaries, however, thought that his legacy would lie not just in the unmatched technical facility that he drilled into his players, but in what he insisted that they perform. As the critic and composer Virgil Thomson wrote in 1947, "His unique position in a world full of excellent conductors, many of them devoted to contemporary music, is that he has played more of it, launched more of it, published more of it and paid for more of it than anybody else living." His place in history, Thomson concluded, was "already assured and glorious."
Koussevitzky's record remains remarkable, as if he bent a significant part of music history to his will. Deploying wealth acquired from his marriage to his second wife, Natalie Ushkova, in 1909 he founded Éditions Russes de Musique, a publishing house that he used to provide financial security for Russian composers, as well as scores for himself to build his career. Scriabin, Prokofiev and Stravinsky all benefited. In 1942, in memory of Natalie, he created the Koussevitzky Music Foundation to fund new works. Britten, Messiaen and Martinu received early commissions; its grants currently total 448.
According to the Boston Symphony, the orchestra gave 146 world premieres during his tenure, as well as another 86 U.S. premieres and many, many more performances of recent pieces he thought deserving of an audience. He led more than 300 works written by Americans. To those in his favor, he was a hero. "It is easy to foresee that the story of Serge Koussevitzky and the American composer will some day take on the character of a legend," said Aaron Copland, a friend. "Here at least is one legend that will have been well founded."
The legend has dimmed. The Boston Symphony has periodically labored to keep the flame alive, and as it tries to recapture its old progressivism under its new president and chief executive, Chad Smith, it is citing Koussevitzky as precedent. The orchestra is celebrating 150 years since his birth and 100 years since his arrival in Boston with an array of online and physical exhibitions, as well as concerts and events at Tanglewood, the summer festival and training center he forged in the Berkshires.
Otherwise, Koussevitzky has been left largely to myth. The only serious biography written in English came out 77 years ago. (Its author, the Boston critic Moses Smith, was unsparing enough that Koussevitzky sued to prevent its release.) Newer volumes by the musicologist Victor Yuzefovich still await translation from Russian. On record, Koussevitzky has fared dreadfully. Bafflingly few of his studio recordings are readily available, though Pristine and other labels offer some, along with live broadcasts. Sony, which has lately brought out sets dedicated to the recordings of many a less consequential conductor, hasn't confirmed a release date for its coming Koussevitzky box.
How to explain this fate, for a man who was once mentioned in the same breath as Toscanini? For one thing, the sound of Koussevitzky's Boston Symphony did not endure; his successor, Charles Munch, preferred drier, leaner textures. For another, Koussevitzky's taste for subjectivity was not exactly fashionable in his own time, and it became still less so as fidelity to the letter of a score became an article of faith among musicians. A third plausible reason is rather more disheartening: As classical music buried its head ever more deeply in the past after Koussevitzky's death, a legacy that looked resolutely forward paid the price.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Koussevitzky was born as Sergei in 1874, in Vyshny Volochyok, Russia, a town on the road from Moscow to St. Petersburg. His parents were klezmer musicians, and he took to the arts young, forcing his way into music school on a promise to learn the double bass. Remarkably, he became Europe's leading soloist on the instrument before making his debut as a conductor in Berlin in 1908. "Oh Lord, how happy I would be if only I could play the double bass!" Furtwängler later said. "Had Koussevitzky not mastered this instrument he would never have succeeded in achieving such sonorities from the strings of his orchestra."
Koussevitzky returned to Russia from Germany. He founded his own orchestra and took it on tour along the Volga River on a steamer. In 1920, after Bolsheviks seized his home and part of his fortune, he joined other émigrés in Paris, where he again formed an ensemble and started a concert series. Commissions like Ravel's orchestration of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" confirmed his reputation as a force for new music; he "created a new orchestral tradition for us," one French critic reflected. Indeed, Koussevitzky's reputation crossed the Atlantic before he did. Shortly before he arrived in America, the Boston Symphony had to reassure its patrons that he was not "exclusively a modernist, under whose baton the classics will suffer neglect or worse."
Smith's biography relates that Koussevitzky's initial years in Boston posed a steep challenge. The Boston Symphony had experienced its fair share of turbulence: the internment of its conductor, Karl Muck, and the firing of 18 German musicians during World War I; the death of its founder, Henry Lee Higginson, in 1919; a strike, in 1920, whose defeat left the musicians unprotected by a labor union until 1942.
If the conductor Pierre Monteux had brought the orchestra close to its old standards by 1924, Koussevitzky faced his own difficulties. Boston had a long season, and he was expected to conduct almost all of it. Musicians picked at his technique, while stories circulated that he could not read a score and employed pianists to play works through so he could learn them. "It is only a pity that there are not more conductors possessed of a similar abysmal ignorance," noted Downes, the Times critic.
And Koussevitzky was a bully, humiliating his musicians with the threat of dismissal always in the air. "His orchestra, if they didn't play well, it was a personal insult to him," recalled the violinist Harry Ellis Dickson, for an oral history project now held in the orchestra's archives. "He wasn't a very nice man," said Phil Kaplan, a flutist. "He was not a gentleman. He was autocratic to the point of nausea, sometimes." The bassist Willis Page remembered Koussevitzky being furious at a player who had returned from fighting in World War II and told him that the orchestra should embrace democracy. Page said that Koussevitzky responded: "I'm the dictator. I say 'do,' and you do."
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Koussevitzky had an exorbitant view of the role of the conductor. "We have a great deal of evidence that musical performers have a right to interpret compositions freely," he said in 1938. "They hold that right from the composer." Some composers associated with Koussevitzky hated this idea, most notably Stravinsky, but others were grateful for the honor it implied. "The American composer is accustomed to hit-and-run performances of his works," Howard Hanson wrote. "He is less accustomed to the Koussevitzky performance, a carefully rehearsed and searching realization of the orchestral score." Several of his recordings sound strikingly free now, including much of his famous Sibelius.
Composers needed somebody to trust in them, Koussevitzky thought, and above all to play their work with audible belief. Broadcast recordings of Bartók's Concerto for Orchestra, Copland's Third Symphony and Shostakovich's Ninth have their flaws, but timidity is not among them. Conceiving music as a living art, Koussevitzky performed a composer's early works if he saw potential in them, then paid for new ones; if he admired the pieces, he repeated them. In 1949, he gave two Carnegie Hall concerts of music by Americans he had supported: Schuman, Barber, Cowell, Piston, Diamond, Fine, Hanson, Harris, Copland and Burlingame Hill all made the bill.
If the list was long, it was limited. Koussevitzky gave genuine experimentalists little exposure, performing Schoenberg, Berg and Webern only rarely, and never Ives, Ruggles or Varèse. He played music by women such as Lili Boulanger, Germaine Tailleferre and Mabel Daniels, yet offered them no consistent backing. Early Tanglewood classes were relatively diverse, but ongoing research by Douglas Shadle has found that Florence Price was far from the only Black composer to receive a cursory note, if any reply at all, when they asked Koussevitzky to play their works. William L. Dawson and William Grant Still had similar luck.
For better and worse, Koussevitzky's influence ran deep. "Of all the conductors who have come here he will leave the deepest imprint upon the musical evolution of America," Downes wrote in a tribute upon his death in 1951. That may not still hold true today. But at least we might take note.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: CrowdStrike's cybersecurity software is used by scores of industries, including airlines, hospitals and retailers, to prevent hacks and data breaches.
On Friday morning, flights were canceled, broadcasters went off air, trains didn't run and medical procedures were delayed around the world. Frustrated workers were confronted with blue computer screens and no obvious way to get back online.
The root of the problem? CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company dedicated to preventing exactly this sort of global outage.
CrowdStrike, which was founded in 2011, is a cloud-based cybersecurity platform whose software is used by scores of industries around the world to protect against hackers and outside breaches.
Its software secures computers at many Fortune 500 companies, and the company has built a reputation over the years as one that can solve even the toughest security problems. CrowdStrike was tapped to investigate the hack of Sony Pictures in 2014, which resulted in the release of confidential data from the movie studio, and the hack of the Democratic National Committee in 2016, which exposed Hillary Clinton's emails. CrowdStrike serves about 29,000 customers and has about $ 4 billion in annual sales.
Cybersecurity software like CrowdStrike's has broad privileges to run across a computer system, including into sensitive areas. That means when errors occur, the ripple effect can be significant.
CrowdStrike updates its security software automatically and silently. A flawed update on Friday morning, of its Falcon Sensor software, resulted in crashes of machines running Microsoft Windows operating system and caused the worldwide chaos.
We're deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers," George Kurtz, the chief executive of CrowdStrike, said in an interview on the "Today" show. "We know what the issue is. We're resolving and have resolved the issue now."
Mr. Kurtz said the outages were not the result of a security incident or cyberattack.
An updated fix of the software has been sent to computers, but experts said outages would most likely persist as CrowdStrike customers worked to reboot computers that had already been affected. Some systems were able to automatically install the fix, Mr. Kurtz said, while others would require manual intervention from I.T. specialists.
CrowdStrike, which went public in 2019, is worth about $ 76 billion. Its stock fell dramatically on Friday after news of the outage, and remained down about eight percent that morning.
"This is an unprecedented event and not something we or anyone had in their cards," analysts for Evercore, an investment banking firm, wrote in a note to investors. "This event clearly proves that cyber needs to be diversified and the idea of relying on one or two vendors will come under scrutiny."

Software Update Goes Awry, Causing Chaos Throughout the World: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Airlines, hospitals and people's computers were affected after CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company, sent out a flawed software update.
Airlines grounded flights. Operators of 911 lines could not respond to emergencies. Hospitals canceled surgeries. Retailers closed for the day. And the actions all traced back to a batch of bad computer code.
A flawed software update sent out by a little-known cybersecurity company caused chaos and disruption around the world on Friday. The company, CrowdStrike, based in Austin, Texas, makes software used by multinational corporations, government agencies and scores of other organizations to protect against hackers and online intruders.
But when CrowdStrike sent its update on Thursday to its customers that run Microsoft Windows software, computers began to crash.
The fallout, which was immediate and inescapable, highlighted the brittleness of global technology infrastructure. The world has become reliant on Microsoft and a handful of cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike. So when a single flawed piece of software is released over the internet, it can almost instantly damage countless companies and organizations that depend on the technology as part of everyday business.
"This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world's core internet infrastructure," said Ciaran Martin, the former chief executive of Britain's National Cyber Security Center and a professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University.
A cyberattack did not cause the widespread outage, but the effects on Friday showed how devastating the damage can be when a main artery of the global technology system is disrupted. It raised broader questions about CrowdStrike's testing processes and what repercussions such software firms should face when flaws in their code cause major disruptions.
While outages are common, often caused by technical errors or cyberattacks, the scale of what unfolded on Friday was unparalleled.
"This is historic," said Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer at WithSecure, a cybersecurity company. "We haven't had an incident like this."
George Kurtz, CrowdStrike's chief executive, said that the company took responsibility for the mistake and that a software fix had been released. He warned that it could be some time before tech systems returned to normal.
"We're deeply sorry for the impact that we've caused to customers, to travelers, to anyone affected by this," he said in an interview on Friday on NBC's "Today" show.
Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, blamed CrowdStrike and said the company was working to help customers "bring their systems back online." Apple and Linux machines were not affected by the CrowdStrike software update.
A White House official said the administration was in "regular contact" with CrowdStrike and had convened agencies to assess the impact of the outage on the federal government's operations.
CrowdStrike, founded in 2011 by Mr. Kurtz and others, has built a reputation over the years as a firm that could solve even the toughest security problems. It was tapped to investigate a 2014 hack of Sony Pictures and the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee, which exposed Hillary Clinton's emails.
But problems stemming from CrowdStrike's products have surfaced before. In April, the company pushed a software update to customers running the Linux system that crashed computers, according to an internal CrowdStrike report sent to customers about the incident, which was obtained by The New York Times.
The bug, which did not appear to be related to Friday's outage, took CrowdStrike nearly five days to fix, the report said. CrowdStrike promised to improve its testing process going forward, according to the report.
On Thursday, the tech issues began when Microsoft dealt with an outage on its cloud service system, Azure, which affected some airlines.
Then CrowdStrike sent an update for its software called Falcon Sensor, which scans a computer for intrusions and signs of hacking. If everything had gone according to plan, CrowdStrike's software would have received minor improvements and customers would have hardly noticed.
Instead, when CrowdStrike's faulty update reached computers running Microsoft Windows, it caused the machines to shut down and then endlessly reboot. Workers around the world were greeted with what is known as the "blue screen of death" on their computers. Insufficient testing at CrowdStrike was a likely source of the problem, experts said.
As computers restarted themselves over and over, known as the "doom loop," there was little CrowdStrike could do to fix the problem. Tech staff at affected companies were faced with a choice: walk around to each machine and remove the bit of flawed code, or wait and hope for a solution from CrowdStrike.
The problems cascaded instantly. At Sydney Airport in Australia, travelers encountered delays and cancellations, as did those in Hong Kong, India, Dubai, Berlin and Amsterdam. At least five U.S. airlines -- Allegiant Air, American, Delta, Spirit and United -- grounded all flights for a time, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Health care systems were crippled, forcing hospitals to cancel noncritical surgeries. In the United States, 911 lines went down in multiple states, though many of those problems were being resolved later on Friday. Britain's National Health Service also reported issues.
"We knew we had a catastrophe on our hands," said B.J. Moore, the chief information officer for Providence Health, which has 52 hospitals in seven states. He said 15,000 servers were down and 40,000 out of Providence's 150,000 computers were affected, adding that it was "worse than a cyberattack."
The United Parcel Service and FedEx said they were affected. Customers with TD Bank, one of the biggest banks in the United States, reported issues accessing their online accounts. Several state and municipal court systems closed for the day because of the outage.
At CrowdStrike, engineers described an atmosphere of confusion as the company struggled to contain the damage.
Executives urged employees not to speculate on why the mistake happened and directed them to focus on a fix for the computers that were affected, said two engineers who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Computers not connected to the cloud required a physical fix to the error introduced by CrowdStrike, they said, which could take weeks.
Within several hours of the faulty software going out, CrowdStrike sent out a software patch as a fix that would stop computers from endlessly rebooting.
Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant, said the outage would still take time to resolve because a suggested solution for some organizations involved rebooting each computer manually into safe mode, deleting a specific file and then restarting the computer.
While that is a relatively straightforward process, security experts said, it may not be easy to do at scale. Those with organized and well-staffed information technology teams could potentially fix the issues more quickly, Mr. Olejnik said.
Unlike the iPhone software updates that Apple sends to customers, the incident highlighted information technology systems that operate in the background. The CrowdStrike issues were compounded because the software being updated performed critical cybersecurity tasks, giving it access to scan a computer to look for viruses and other malicious attacks.
Cybersecurity tools operate quietly in the background to defend computers against attacks. The software is frequently updated with new defenses as hackers develop fresh methods of attack, but constant updates mean there are many opportunities for mistakes to happen.
"One of the tricky parts of security software is it needs to have absolute privileges over your entire computer in order to do its job," said Thomas Parenty, a cybersecurity consultant and a former U.S. National Security Agency analyst. "So if there's something wrong with it, the consequences are vastly greater than if your spreadsheet doesn't work."
On Friday, the stock price of CrowdStrike, which reported $ 3 billion in annual revenue last year, closed down 11 percent.
The company faces questions about what liabilities it and other software makers face for major disruptions and cybersecurity incidents. The consequences for significant outages can be so minimal that companies are not motivated to make more fundamental changes, experts said. While a car manufacturer would face stiff penalties for faulty brakes, a software provider can often issue another update and move on.
"Until software companies have to pay a price for faulty products, we will be no safer tomorrow than we are today," Mr. Parenty said.

Making a Mockery of Denial: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The screenwriters of "Fly Me to the Moon" say they emphasized the facts of the Apollo 11 landing, but experts worry that clips can be misused.
The new Scarlett Johansson-Channing Tatum vehicle "Fly Me to the Moon" uses a long-debunked conspiracy theory as the jumping-off point for a space-race romantic comedy. At the end of the 1960s, a wary NASA recognizes the need for better public relations during the Vietnam War. The resulting campaign leads to a faked version of the Apollo 11 mission being shot on a sound stage even as the real mission is unfolding. Shenanigans, and romance, ensue.
"Fly Me to the Moon" isn't the first movie based on the mistaken belief that the moon landing was a hoax, a conspiracy theory that first arose in the 1970s. "Capricorn One" (1978), about a faked mission to Mars, taps into Watergate-era institutional distrust, and more recently, "Moonwalkers" (2015) pairs a C.I.A. agent with a rock band manager to fake the Apollo 11 landing.
What sets "Fly Me to the Moon" apart is its insistence on the truth. The movie's writers say they hope it will reinforce the real story of the moon landing. But is that possible in a post-Covid age when conspiracy theories are amplified on social media?
The screenplay, written by Rose Gilroy and based on a story by Keenan Flynn and Bill Kirstein, plays with the theory, including a joke on some conspiracists' belief that the director Stanley Kubrick supposedly had a hand in faking the historic event. (He did not.) But ultimately the film emphasizes that the Apollo 11 landing did take place.
Flynn said the initial idea for the movie came in 2016. As the nation wrangled with questions about truth during a presidential campaign in which Donald J. Trump frequently castigated the "lying" media, the moon landing made for a perfect setting.
"That was the assignment," Flynn said. "How do you have your cake and eat it, too? You have fun with the fake moon landing, but you really bring home that truth matters by highlighting that achievement."
Gilroy said that she had read some books to better understand the conspiracy but that there was simply nothing to them.
"We wanted to build a story around the idea of these people coming together to ensure that the mission is real," she said. "Not in any of my research did I ever come across one iota of a fact that made me question in any way the validity of this accomplishment."
Adam Frank, an astronomer and physicist at the University of Rochester whose work focuses on science denial, said pop culture had a responsibility to fight a nihilistic tendency to doubt science and human potential.
"It's lazy writing to say 'the government was in on the conspiracy' as opposed to 'people actually all worked together and they found the answer,"' Frank said. "They worked for 20 years and sent a probe to Mars and it did exactly what they said they were going to do. Somehow, that is less exciting than, 'It didn't work and they had a conspiracy."'
"Fly Me to the Moon" does focus on the laborious team effort that went into the landing. But now that it's easier than ever to take an image out of context and spread it online, good intentions can be lost. Fretting about the film may also be quaint at this point: Images generated by artificial intelligence showing a faked-moon-landing film set went viral earlier this year.
Lawrence Hamilton, a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire who studies anti-science conspiracy belief, pointed to an image used by moon landing deniers as a cautionary tale. The photo, showing astronauts without their helmets during a training exercise at the Kennedy Space Center, has been shared repeatedly on social media over the years.
"They said, 'This is them faking the moon landing, and it's proof,"' he recalled. "And they will do the same thing with clips from this movie. They'll do whatever it takes to say, 'This proves what we've said all along."'
For people who don't have strong memories of watching the moon landing, that influence can be strong. In a 2021 national survey, Hamilton found that only 12 percent of respondents believed that the moon landings were faked, but that millennials were more likely than other generations to deny it happened.
Gen Z-ers were more likely to be unsure if it happened. A recent TikTok filter asking users to rank things on a scale of one to 10 based on how much they believe in them, with one being more likely and 10 being less likely, inspired multiple videos with people placing the moon landing below things like God, magic and ghosts. But a few popular videos doesn't mean Gen-Zers are flocking to moon landing conspiracies en masse, as the survey shows.
One person who isn't worried about the movie unintentionally bolstering conspiracy beliefs: Anna Garcia, the actress who plays Ruby, an assistant to Johansson's character.
"I think if someone's really dumb, they'll definitely get that message," Garcia told Variety at the movie's premiere. "I think if someone is sort of dumb as rocks, they'll be like, 'It was fake."'

Executives urged employees not to speculate on why the mistake happened and directed them to focus on a fix for the computers that were affected, said two engineers who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Computers not connected to the cloud required a physical fix to the error introduced by CrowdStrike, they said, which could take weeks.
Within several hours of the faulty software going out, CrowdStrike sent out a software patch as a fix that would stop computers from endlessly rebooting.
Lukasz Olejnik, an independent cybersecurity researcher and consultant, said the outage would still take time to resolve because a suggested solution for some organizations involved rebooting each computer manually into safe mode, deleting a specific file and then restarting the computer.
While that is a relatively straightforward process, security experts said, it may not be easy to do at scale. Those with organized and well-staffed information technology teams could potentially fix the issues more quickly, Olejnik said.
Unlike the iPhone software updates that Apple sends to customers, the incident highlighted information technology systems that operate in the background. The CrowdStrike issues were compounded because the software being updated performed critical cybersecurity tasks, giving it access to scan a computer to look for viruses and other malicious attacks.
Cybersecurity tools operate quietly in the background to defend computers against attacks. The software is frequently updated with new defenses as hackers develop fresh methods of attack, but constant updates mean there are many opportunities for mistakes to happen.
“One of the tricky parts of security software is it needs to have absolute privileges over your entire computer in order to do its job,” said Thomas Parenty, a cybersecurity consultant and a former U.S. National Security Agency analyst. “So if there’s something wrong with it, the consequences are vastly greater than if your spreadsheet doesn’t work.”
On Friday, the stock price of CrowdStrike, which reported $3 billion in annual revenue last year, closed down 11%.
The company faces questions about what liabilities it and other software makers face for major disruptions and cybersecurity incidents. The consequences for significant outages can be so minimal that companies are not motivated to make more fundamental changes, experts said. While a car manufacturer would face stiff penalties for faulty brakes, a software provider can often issue another update and move on.
“Until software companies have to pay a price for faulty products, we will be no safer tomorrow than we are today,” Parenty said.

In Japan, Children's Book Bag Holds Generations of Tradition: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The Book Bag That Binds Japanese Society
In Japan, cultural expectations are repeatedly drilled into children at school and at home, with peer pressure playing as powerful a role as any particular authority or law. On the surface, at least, that can help Japanese society run smoothly.
During the coronavirus pandemic, for example, the government never mandated masks or lockdowns, yet the majority of residents wore face coverings in public and refrained from going out to crowded venues. Japanese tend to stand quietly in lines, obey traffic signals and clean up after themselves during sports and other events because they have been trained from kindergarten to do so.
Carrying the bulky randoseru to school is "not even a rule imposed by anyone but a rule that everyone is upholding together," said Shoko Fukushima, associate professor of education administration at the Chiba Institute of Technology.
On the first day of school this spring -- the Japanese school year starts in April -- flocks of eager first graders and their parents arrived for an entrance ceremony at Kitasuna Elementary School in the Koto neighborhood of eastern Tokyo.
Seeking to capture an iconic moment mirrored across generations of Japanese family photo albums, the children, almost all of them carrying randoseru, lined up with their parents to pose for pictures in front of the school gate.
"An overwhelming majority of the children choose randoseru, and our generation used randoseru," said Sarii Akimoto, whose son, Kotaro, 6, had selected a camel-colored backpack. "So we thought it would be nice."
Traditionally, the uniformity was even more pronounced, with boys carrying black randoseru and girls carrying red ones. In recent years, growing discussion of diversity and individuality has prompted retailers to offer the backpacks in a rainbow of colors and with some distinctive details like embroidered cartoon characters, animals or flowers, or inside liners made from different fabrics.
Still, a majority of boys today carry black randoseru, although lavender has overtaken red in popularity among girls, according to the Randoseru Association. And aside from the color variations and an increased capacity to accommodate more textbooks and digital tablets, the shape and structure of the bags have remained remarkably consistent over decades.
The near totemic status of the randoseru dates back to the 19th century, during the Meiji era, when Japan transitioned from an isolated feudal kingdom to a modern nation navigating a new relationship with the outside world. The educational system helped unify a network of independent fiefs -- with their own customs -- into a single nation with a shared culture.
Schools inculcated the idea that "everyone is the same, everyone is family," said Ittoku Tomano, an associate professor of philosophy and education at Kumamoto University.
In 1885, Gakushuin, a school that educates Japan's imperial family, designated as its official school bag a hands-free model that resembled a military backpack from the Netherlands known as the ransel. From there, historians say, the randoseru quickly became Japan's ubiquitous marker of childhood identity.
The military roots of the randoseru are in keeping with Japanese educational methods. Students learn to march in step with one another, drilling on the playground and in the classroom. The school system did not just help build a national identity; before and during World War II, it also prepared students for military mobilization.
After the war, the country mobilized again, this time to rebuild an economy with dutiful, compliant workers. In recognition of the strong solidarity symbolized by the randoseru, some large companies would give the backpacks as gifts to the children of employees.
That practice continues to this day. At a ceremony earlier this year at the Tokyo headquarters of Sony, Hiroki Totoki, the company's president, addressed a group of 250 rising first graders.
He described the randoseru ceremony -- the company's 66th -- as "an important bond that connects families." After Mr. Totoki's remarks, Sony employees handed out the backpacks, all of them embossed with a corporate logo.
Grandparents often buy the randoseru as a commemorative gift. The leather versions can be quite expensive, with an average price of around 60,000 yen, or $ 380.
Shopping for the randoseru is a ritual that starts as early as a year before a child enters first grade.
At Tsuchiya Kaban, a nearly 60-year-old randoseru manufacturer in eastern Tokyo, families make appointments for their children to try on different-colored models in a showroom before placing orders to be fulfilled at the attached factory. Each bag is assembled from six main parts and takes about a month to put together.
Shinichiro Ito, who with his wife, Emiko, was shopping this spring with their 5-year-old daughter, Shiori, said they never considered any alternatives to the randoseru.
"It is still the image you have when you think of an elementary school bag," Mr. Ito said. Shiori tried on bags in several colors, including light blue and dusty rose, before settling on a gray leather randoseru that cost more than $ 500.
Each Tsuchiya Kaban bag comes with a six-year guarantee on the assumption that most students will use their randoseru throughout elementary school. As a memento, some children choose to turn their used bags into wallets or cases for train passes once they graduate.
In recent years, some parents and children's advocates have complained that the bags are too burdensome for the youngest children. Randoseru can cover half of the body of a typical first grader. Even unloaded, the average bag weighs about three pounds.
Most schools do not have personal lockers for students or much desk storage space, so students frequently carry textbooks and school supplies back and forth from home. And in a culture that puts a high value on hard work, patience, perseverance and endurance, the movement to relieve children of the randoseru burden hasn't gotten very far.
"Those who have no heart say that 'recent children are weak; back in our day we carried around those heavy bags,"' said Ms. Fukushima, the education professor.
A few manufacturers have developed alternatives that retain the randoseru shape while using lighter materials like nylon. But these have been slow to gain traction.
On a recent morning, Kotaro Akimoto, a first grader, left for school carrying a bag that weighed about six pounds, about one-seventh of his body weight. Walking the 10-minute route to school, he joined several other classmates and older students, all of whom were carrying a randoseru.
In Kotaro's classroom, Megumi Omata, his teacher, had posted a diagram of morning tasks, with pictures to represent the order in which the students should proceed. An illustration of a randoseru indicated the stage of stowing school bags in cubbies for the day.
At the end of the day, Kaho Minami, 11, a sixth grader with a deep-red randoseru stitched with embroidered flowers that she had carried throughout elementary school, said she never yearned for any other kind of bag. "Because everyone wears a randoseru," she said, "I think it is a good thing."

Saudi Money Makes a Big Splash In the Flashy Video Game Industry: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The fans flooded through the streets of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by the thousands, kept cool by mist machines in the 110-degree heat. A 30-foot-tall replica gold trophy towered over onlookers at the city's center. For a moment, covered in beams of brightly colored light, a country defined by tradition looked futuristic.
It was the inaugural Esports World Cup, a coming-out party for Saudi Arabia's growing video game industry. As part of its plan to diversify its economy from oil, the Saudi government has said it will invest $ 38 billion in video games by 2030 through its Public Investment Fund, known as the P.I.F., a wealth fund that manages $ 700 billion.
The wealth behind that commitment was on full display in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, this month, but the country's influence in video games now extends far beyond its borders. In what has been a financially difficult year for the industry, which has seen mass layoffs, many of the world's largest video game companies and influencers have quietly partnered with the oil-rich Saudis.
Through acquisitions, a company funded by the P.I.F. called Savvy Games Group now owns 40 percent of the total e-sports market share, a spokesperson said. (E-sports are video games played by professional gamers in competitive tournaments.) The P.I.F. and its subsidiaries have spent roughly $ 6 billion buying up game companies and $ 14 billion on stock investments.
"They've used unlimited resources to pretty much make whatever they want to happen, happen," said Rod Breslau, a gaming and e-sports analyst.
Some critics have labeled the investments "games washing," an attempt to polish the country's reputation and human rights abuses with entertainment and tourism, as it has been accused of doing with its professional golf and soccer leagues. Some gamers have denounced the country's involvement and vowed to boycott its events. And it can be jarring for visitors to see women -- some of them in elaborate costumes -- working at a conference in a country where women's rights have historically been, and continue to be, very restricted.
But as Saudi money becomes ubiquitous in the e-sports world, avoiding it has become increasingly difficult.
"We've gotten to the point where if you draw the line and say, 'I'm not working for a Saudi-owned company,' or 'I'm not going to Saudi Arabia,' your career in e-sports would probably be very short lived," said Parker Mackay, an e-sports broadcaster who resigned from his position on an awards panel in June after it partnered with a Saudi-funded organization.
Along with buying up game publishers and hosting extravagant e-sports tournaments, the Saudi kingdom is building a gaming city with its own e-sports district 30 miles west of Riyadh called Qiddiya. Its companies have partnered with video game giants like Sony and Activision Blizzard, which is owned by Microsoft, and media companies like Rolling Stone and CNN.
Leaders of Saudi gaming organizations have pushed back on criticism of the kingdom's financial interest in gaming.
"Three years ago, I would have had my own prejudices as well, thinking about what Saudi is and what it is not," said Ralf Reichert, the chief executive officer of the Esports World Cup Foundation. "Ultimately, everyone needs to judge it on their own, and I just invite people to come and see it."
Once a country that effectively banned movie theaters and strictly restricted tourism, Saudi Arabia has poured wealth into sports and entertainment at a staggering rate. Notably, the 38-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is an avid gamer.
The P.I.F. is heavily invested in publicly traded video game companies. Its stock portfolio includes a $ 3.4 billion investment in Electronic Arts, $ 1.7 billion in Take-Two Interactive and $ 5.2 billion in Nintendo, according to data from Nasdaq. Its 8.3 percent stake in Nintendo makes it the Japanese company's largest outside investor, according to Japanese regulatory filings. The fund also had a $ 3.3 billion investment in Activision Blizzard before it was acquired by Microsoft.
In 2021, the P.I.F. created Savvy Games Group to spearhead its planned $ 38 billion investment in the industry. The fund recruited Brian Ward, a former director at Electronic Arts and vice president at Activision Blizzard, to be the company's chief executive officer.
As part of the government's plan to create 250 video game companies and 39,000 new jobs on Saudi soil, Savvy Games Group and other P.I.F.-funded companies have recruited top game developer talent from the United States and Asia. In June, Saudi Arabia's U.S. embassy launched an exchange program to connect young Saudi game developers with Americans.
Savvy Games Group has already acquired a number of key industry players, most notably Electronic Sports League, which is to e-sports what the PGA Tour is to golf, and Scopely, the game studio behind Monopoly Go. The company also acquired Faceit, a digital e-sports platform, combining it with its other e-sports properties into Electronic Sports League Faceit Group, or E.F.G.
In January, Activision Blizzard partnered with E.F.G. to revive the e-sports circuit for its popular game Overwatch, which had shuttered a few months earlier.
In May, E.F.G. provided funding for Rolling Stone to create a new gaming desk.
Rolling Stone did not respond to a request for comment.
Back in Riyadh at the Esports World Cup, gamers competed for a share of a $ 60 million prize pool, the largest ever for an event of its kind.
The tournament is meant to be "a lighthouse in the world sports calendar," Mr. Reichert said.
The eight-week event was organized by the Esports World Cup Foundation, a Saudi nonprofit.
The foundation has leaned on big-name partnerships to spread its influence. In March, Sony became a founding partner of the tournament and is set to produce an Esports World Cup documentary. In June, Warner Bros. Discovery partnered with the foundation to stream the event on CNN. Hours before the tournament's opening ceremony, two dozen of the most followed gaming influencers posted links to its livestream on X with the hashtag #EWCPartner.
Some e-sports teams are trying to make a social statement while still accepting Saudi cash. Team Liquid, an e-sports team known for promoting diversity and inclusion in the sport, wore jerseys with a Pride logo during competition. Its leaders had mulled over what it meant to play in Riyadh in the weeks leading up to the tournament.
"Participating in a region of the world with a pretty egregious track record of human rights is difficult," said Steve Arhancet, the team's co-chief executive officer. Mr. Arhancet, who is gay, said he took a trip to Riyadh on his own before deciding whether to compete in the tournament.
Some influencers tried to justify their participation to their fans on social media.
Joshua Howard, a sportscaster for the tournament, said his 10 day contract with the Esports World Cup will account for 20 to 30 percent of his annual earnings.
"When you see an opportunity come along that way, it's really hard to say no, and I don't begrudge anyone for saying no or being upset that I'm here," Mr. Howard said.
Katarina Premfors contributed reporting in Riyadh.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On the final show of the "Saturday Night Live" season, Colin Jost and Michael Che do a joke swap on "Weekend Update," writing embarrassing gags for one another to read.
Since Mr. Jost married Scarlett Johansson, in 2020, Mr. Che has delighted in tormenting his partner by giving him racy jokes to read about his movie-star wife.
In May, Mr. Jost laughed and hung his head sheepishly as he read his joke: "ChatGPT has released a new voice-assistant feature inspired by Scarlett Johansson's A.I. character in 'Her.' Which I have never bothered to watch because, without that body, what's the point of listening?"
And what does that body think about that joke?
"I think I blacked out during it," Ms. Johansson said, with her larky laugh. "I certainly don't get mad. I definitely am terrified that I'm going to have to go into hiding now, get a bunch of hate mail. Yet somehow, immediately afterward, I can have a beer with Che."
The actress, 39, was curled up on a couch at the Whitby Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, her bare feet tucked under her. She was glowing in day sequins in a saucy black Rodarte dress, her black Balmain mules dropped on the floor. On her wrist is tattooed a bracelet with Thor's hammer, a nod to her father's Danish roots, with a small "I ❤️ NY" embedded in it. She is in the process of removing a different tattoo on her arm, a sunrise.
Those who know Ms. Johansson talk about her air of calm, her generosity, her un-diva ways, and, as her husband calls it, her "fundamentally positive outlook."
"She's very good at envisioning what she wants from every phase of life and career," Mr. Jost said.
At a time when everyone always seems one-half there, the other half absorbed by their fiendish little devices, Ms. Johansson is intensely present. She stays off social media; she doesn't want to share her life with strangers, which gives her mystique in an overexposed world. Her large green eyes stay trained on me for nearly two hours, asking nearly as many questions as she fields.
She, too, is a comic star at "S.N.L.," having hosted six times and killed playing Ivanka Trump (introducing her perfume, "Complicit") and Senator Katie Britt of Alabama (giving a bizarre, creepily flirty response to President Biden's State of the Union address).
"I'm crazy about her," the usually laconic Lorne Michaels said. Mr. Michaels, who has seen neuroses and addictions galore over 49 seasons of "S.N.L.," loves the fact that Ms. Johansson is "brilliant" and "no fuss."
"Duck to water," he said. "She just has it. It's just the sparkle in her eyes. She's alive and you can kind of see it. She focuses and does the work and then, 10 minutes later, you're talking about something else. She's very warm as a person and very clear about what she believes in."
Ms. Johansson is promoting her production company's first film, "Fly Me to the Moon," a summer romp about a fake moon landing and true love, co-starring Channing Tatum and Woody Harrelson and directed by Greg Berlanti.
In one scene, in which the con artist turned advertising whiz played by Ms. Johansson tries to woo lawmakers into appropriating more funds for NASA, Mr. Jost pops up as a bespectacled senator; the comedian said his character was "some combination of Mitch McConnell and Foghorn Leghorn." (Ms. Johansson joked to Jimmy Fallon that Mr. Jost had to do cameos in her films as part of their prenup.)
I asked Mr. Jost if he got jealous being on set while his wife was canoodling with Mr. Tatum.
"I think if I was, at this point, I'd be in trouble," he said. "When Scarlett won the American Cinematheque Award, we were there and one of the things that night was a whole montage of kisses. I was like: 'OK, there you go. I'm glad someone put it together in one package."'
When I tell him she called their relationship "a delicate ecosystem," he dryly shot back: "She was just filming 'Jurassic Park,' so she's thinking of everything in terms of delicate ecosystems."
In a world with a paucity of movie stars, Ms. Johansson is a genuine twinklie, with an ambrosial voice harking back to the 1940s, when all the top actresses had those great, distinctive voices.
"She's like Carole Lombard -- that very rare combination of glamorous, gorgeous, intelligence," said Tom Rothman, the head of Sony Pictures' film division. "That makes for a true movie star with a capital M and a capital S." He said Sony was eager to put the movie, financed by Apple Original Films, on big screens across the country, hoping a zany romantic conspiracy comedy could lure moviegoers back to theaters this summer.
Mr. Berlanti recalled that when they were shooting the NASA scenes at Cape Canaveral, engineers and movie crew members, men and women, would stop work to watch as Ms. Johansson sashayed onto the set in high heels and one of her colorful retro dresses.
"They're literally building a rocket behind us," Mr. Berlanti said. "It's like, 'Guys, there's a rocket going off the other way.' It's very hard for someone to be at NASA, where there are these giant structures around everybody, and still be the main attraction."
"She's in that first-name pantheon of actresses, Meryl and Julia and Scarlett," he continued. "She's been a star her entire adult life. She's had success in every genre, from blockbusters to art-house films, and even voice-over work. And she hasn't withered under the weight of the star system or the culture."
Lost in 'Lost in Translation'
Ms. Johansson got good reviews from the cast for her aptitude as a producer.
"Scarlett threw a Super Bowl party that was really sweet and really fun for the entire cast, and we all just got to go over to her house and just chill," Mr. Tatum said. "She's very, very good at bringing people together on sets."
Anna Garcia, who plays Ms. Johansson's assistant in the movie, recalled that on the first day of shooting, an actor with a minor part did not know his lines.
"How does this person not know his lines?" Ms. Garcia recalled thinking. "Scarlett was still so kind and worked to calm his nerves down." Ms. Johansson ended up giving another actor one of the lines to lighten the load for the memory-challenged colleague.
Woody Harrelson, who plays a shadowy Nixon operative who wants Ms. Johansson's ad exec to help film a fake moon landing in case the real one goes wrong, said he was surprised as he got to know the actress.
"She's a global superstar and I just never detected even one trace of ego, just such a down-to-earth person," he said. "She's got a very Midwestern vibe, even though she was born in New York. I didn't know if she'd be funny, but she really cracks me up."
He said that the actress, who did not go to college after she was rejected by New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, made time to talk to his youngest daughter, Makani, about the importance of staying in school. She also showed up on the "S.N.L." set last year to give Mr. Harrelson his "Five Timers Club" jacket, commemorating his fifth turn as host.
Ms. Johansson was a child actor, starring with Robert Redford in "The Horse Whisperer." She shot to greater renown in Sofia Coppola's "Lost in Translation," which she filmed when she was 17. She played an insomniac, a young wife at loose ends in Tokyo, where her husband, a photographer, is on assignment. She hangs out with another insomniac, a movie star with marital troubles who's in Japan filming a whiskey ad, played by Bill Murray. ("Make it Suntory time.") The combo was charming.
"That movie was hard to make," Ms. Johansson said. "It was far away. It was 26 days. We were shooting day for night, and night for day. I don't know that we totally knew what it was. Sofia did. She saw what we were getting, but it wasn't like everything was on the page. The script was 76 pages."
Didn't anybody in that Tokyo hotel have an Ambien?
She said it was before Ambien became so popular. Later, when it became the soporific of choice, she popped one on a flight to Berlin and ended up standing on the luggage carousel in a haze, with no memory of how she got her bags to the hotel. "I felt like I was on methamphetamines or something. I had such a weird, out-of-body, speedy, strange experience."
After a nearly three-year marriage to Ryan Reynolds, Ms. Johansson was married to Romain Dauriac, a French journalist and ad executive, and lived in Paris. They have a daughter, Rose, now 9. The actress and Mr. Jost, 42, have a 2-year-old son, Cosmo.
They actually met when Mr. Jost was 23, in his first year with "S.N.L.," and Ms. Johansson was 21, hosting for the first time. He wrote a sketch featuring her, a parody of the MTV reality show "16 and Pregnant."
He was too preoccupied with his own nascent career to clock Ms. Johansson as a love object.
"My first year as a writer, I wasn't like, 'I should probably ask one of the hosts out,"' he said. "I was like, 'Am I going to have a job this year?"'
They saw each other every few years when she came back to host, but they were always involved with other people. Then, when she came to host in 2017, they were both free.
"I asked her out after the host dinner that we have on Tuesday nights," he said. "I was just like, 'You want to go grab a drink?' Then we had drinks until, like, 4 in the morning. It was great. It was not good for my writing, but it was good for my future marriage."
'It's Unfathomable to Me'
Ms. Johansson is a spokeswoman for charities and brands -- she has appeared in campaigns for Calvin Klein, Dolce & Gabbana, L'Oréal, Louis Vuitton and Prada, and she co-founded a skin care line, the Outset. ("I had acne forever," she said. "It really came out of a need.")
She has campaigned for Democratic candidates and has spoken out for women's rights. She met President Biden years ago and has visited him in the Oval Office. She likes his values and his team. She said she felt as if she were living through "a weird nightmare," with polls showing that Donald J. Trump may be on his way back to the White House.
"Trump?" she said. "It's unfathomable to me. That's when I look at Biden and think, given the fact that the election is in a few months' time, what are we doing? I have friends that are like, 'Oh, maybe we could consider this person, or that person.' I'm like: 'What are you talking about? Who?' It just seems to me like totally the wrong time to not support Biden. It seems crazy. It's really depressing."
She's not worried about his age?
"No!" she shot back. "Are you? I'm worried about the Democratic Party."
I asked Ms. Johansson, who is Jewish, what she thought of the ugly eruptions of antisemitism across the country.
"I'm not surprised by antisemitism," she replied simply. "It shouldn't be surprising." (She was nominated for an Oscar for her role in the 2019 movie "Jojo Rabbit," playing the mother of a Hitler youth; the child learns that she is part of the resistance and hiding a Jewish girl in the house.)
Along with the Danish heritage on her father's side, she has Jewish and Eastern European heritage on her mother's side. "My parents used to call all of us 'Danish knishes,"' she said.
She had a modest upbringing in an artsy family, auditioning for roles from the time she was little and learning the hard way how to take rejection, even crying on the subway. She went to P.S. 41 and then to high school at the Greenwich Village Professional Children's School, where her boyfriend was Jack Antonoff. (He wrote a song of longing about her called "Better Love," with the lyric: "Scars are in her name/And she scars me with blame/Hey, Scarlett, you're not the same.")
When she was 13, her mother moved to Los Angeles and she stayed in New York with her father, an architect.
"It was hard," she said. "Although my parents were, at that point, separated. They'd been unhappy for such a long time. It was nice to have some peace at home."
She told Bruce Bozzi on his Hollywood podcast, "Table for Two," a couple of years ago that she did not like being "groomed" to be "what you call a bombshell-type actor." She said being cast in movies as the object of desire made her feel trapped.
I asked her if she still feels that way.
"I think I've outgrown that by just a number of years," she said wryly. About Hollywood's hunger for sex objects, she said: "The bombshell thing, I don't know if that changes, really. It's societal, it's so baked in."
She's No 'Joan of Arc.' And Yet ...
Even though she periodically speaks up on matters she cares about, no one was expecting her to lead the charge on two of the biggest issues facing her industry.
"She's not Joan of Arc," Mr. Michaels said, chuckling. "But she does not back down."
Recently, when I was interviewing Sean Penn, he spoke of Ms. Johansson -- a former inamorata -- with awe: "She's been twice on the cutting edge of stuff. She's a baller. She's one of the top people to me."
Her record in making behemoths bow is impressive: two for two.
Her most recent bout was with Sam Altman of OpenAI. In May, when Mr. Altman debuted his company's new voice assistant, Mr. Jost received a text from a friend asking: "Have you heard the new ChatGPT voice, it sounds exactly like your wife."
Last year, Mr. Altman had asked Ms. Johansson -- who plays an A.I. virtual assistant called Samantha that grows ever more human in the movie "Her," co-starring Joaquin Phoenix -- to do the voice of Sky, one of the voices for OpenAI's new model, but she had said: "No, thank you. Not for me."
"I felt I did not want to be at the forefront of that," she told me. "I just felt it went against my core values." She added: "I don't like to kiss and tell. He came to me with this and I didn't tell anybody except my husband."
She continued, "I also felt for my children it would be strange. I try to be mindful of them." She was bothered by the "nebulous" nature of the technology and where it's headed. (In "Her," which was set in far-off 2025, Samantha says "I'm becoming much more than they programmed," has an orgasm and falls in love.)
OpenAI wanted a voice that would make its new technology sound trustworthy and alluring, even though no one -- including Mr. Altman -- knows exactly where this technology is headed.
Mr. Altman and Elon Musk started OpenAI as a watchdog nonprofit to look out for the interest of humans in the A.I. race, but the two Silicon Valley giants parted ways and Mr. Altman turned part of OpenAI into a lucrative for-profit enterprise in 2019. (Mr. Musk sued OpenAI this year for abandoning its original mission and going for the big bucks, but four months later dropped his suit.)
When Ms. Johansson heard Sky and "that voice was introduced out into the wild, it was surreal. Suddenly, I was getting all these messages."
The day of the launch, Mr. Altman posted one word on X: "her." The star of "Her" fired off a statement, saying the voice was "eerily similar" to hers and that she was "shocked, angered and in disbelief."
"I had actively avoided being a part of the conversation, which was what made it so disturbing," she told me. "I was like, 'How did I get wrapped up in this?"' She added, "It was crazy. I was so angry."
She does not even have a presence on social media because, as she has said, she does not want to share everything in her life with a bunch of strangers.
"I think the fact that it was never an appealing thing for her is probably part of what keeps her a little healthier," Mr. Jost said.
Mr. Altman said in a statement that he had hired a different actress to voice Sky, a woman who just happened to have a similar voice, before he asked Ms. Johansson to be "a sixth voice" for ChatGPT. It was all a misunderstanding, he said, not a mimicking or cloning of her voice. But he "paused" the voice of Sky after Ms. Johansson complained.
I asked her if Mr. Altman would make a good Marvel villain.
"I guess he would -- maybe with a robotic arm," she said, flashing her luminous smile.
She said that no one was truly insulated from the unknowns of our new universe of digital replicas and deepfakes, because there's no comprehensive legislation to regulate it.
"It's like this dark wormhole you can never climb your way out of," she said. "Once you try to take something down in one area, it pops up somewhere else. There are other countries that have different legislation and rules. If your ex-partner is putting out revenge, deepfake porn, your whole life can be completely ruined." (She learned a hard lesson in 2011 about the porousness of privacy in the tech era when a hacker got hold of nude pictures in her phone that she had taken for her first husband, Mr. Reynolds; the hacker was later arrested by the F.B.I. and convicted.)
Ms. Johansson knows that A.I. will have positive effects in some areas, like medicine, but "I think technologies move faster than our fragile human egos can process it, and you see the effects all over, especially with young people. This technology is coming like a thousand-foot wave."
Her friend, the British actor Rupert Friend, with whom she is shooting the new "Jurassic World" movie, was impressed with her victory.
"I think it's a blow for the little guy, if the little guy is humanity," he said. "If she rolls over, or if she got squashed, then the rest of us have got no shot."
In 2021, she also took on the mighty mouse, Disney, filing a lawsuit alleging breach of contract because the studio released "Black Widow" on Disney+ Premier Access simultaneously with its theatrical release.
There is a technological earthquake upending the old Hollywood model. The creative class is waging a war with the suits to get protection as A.I. and streaming upend the old ways, on everything from the right to own their own images and voices and words, to the right to get a fair share of streaming revenue.
To paraphrase James Mason talking to Cary Grant in "North by Northwest," Disney's chief executive at the time, Bob Chapek, who was later ousted, rather overplayed his hand. When the studio accused Ms. Johansson of being "callous" about the effects of the pandemic when she objected to the dual release because it would eat into the theatrical box-office profits, which substantially determined her salary, Mr. Chapek did not see that he was coming across as King Kong stomping after Fay Wray.
She had, after all, helped make Disney billions with her long reign as the slinky redheaded Black Widow in the Marvel franchise. As her agent, Bryan Lourd, put it in his response, they attacked her character and violated her contract, deliberately moving "the revenue stream and profits to the Disney+ side of the company, leaving artistic and financial partners out of their new equation."
She called the lawsuit "a blur" because it came at the height of Covid, just as she was about to have her baby. Disney relented within three months and settled with the star.
"I don't hold a grudge," she said. "I think it was just poor judgment and poor leadership at that time. It just felt very unprofessional to me, the entire ordeal. And honestly, I was incredibly disappointed, especially because I was holding out hope until, finally, my team was like, 'You have to act."'
Courtesy and Dirty Jokes
Ms. Johansson is in postproduction for her first directing effort, "Eleanor the Great," a movie about two women, a 90-year-old Floridian tourist and a 19-year-old student in New York, who strike up a friendship.
When I met with the actress, she had just taken a 25-hour flight from Thailand, where she was in the jungle, pretending to run away from dinosaurs for the latest "Jurassic World" film.
"There's an old adage in acting," Mr. Friend said. "When people are looking at the script or their lines for the day, they go, 'BS, BS, BS, my bit, BS, BS, my bit, my bit, BS, BS."'
"Scarlett is the complete contrary of that," he added. "She, in real life, actually asks you a question and wants to know the answer. You would be surprised how many people get so wrapped up in their world, their hotel room, their agent, their head shot, their latest deal, their Oscar. Scarlett really sets the tone for a movie of collaborators who are treating each other with courtesy and a fair amount of dirty jokes."
She and Mr. Friend are also appearing in the coming Wes Anderson film, "The Phoenician Scheme."
It's hard to find someone who doesn't gush over Ms. Johansson. Mr. Anderson is no different. He has known her since she was a teenager, he said, and when he directed her in last year's "Asteroid City," he could see her turning into a "great, great actress, like Gena Rowlands or Anna Magnani."
"She's also the most charming person to work with, great fun and really funny," he said. "She's pretty stupendous."
Mr. Jost told me that people are always surprised at "how much normal stuff she does. She goes to the supermarket. She's just very good at wearing a hat and she keeps moving. She is able to stay a little under the radar, but she's able to do all these everyday things and enjoy them, too."
"I think part of the reason I fell in love with her is she's a great mom," he added. "I've known Rose, my stepdaughter, since she was 2. It's weird. You get to actually preview someone as a mom."
Mr. Jost did complain, however, about the time Ms. Johansson gave him a facial to promote her skin-care brand -- "Never again," he said -- and when she suggested he try a manicure.
"It was nails on a chalkboard," he said, accidentally making a pun. "I don't like people poking and prodding me."
Ms. Johansson said she has been in romantic relationships with actors that became competitive, and in which one person had the sensation of sacrificing more than the other. But she said that her relationship with Mr. Jost is not competitive and he is not intimidated by her dry, wicked sense of humor.
He is not even daunted by her stature, thanks to her nine Marvel movies, as one of the top-grossing actresses of all time.
"It's hard for me to imagine that that wouldn't be an incredibly attractive quality," she said slyly.
She calls Mr. Jost's comedy "joyful, not meanspirited at all."
"We love to laugh," she said. "That, to me, it's so important. It's a really attractive quality when someone is funny. I had a boyfriend once who got mad at me for not laughing at his jokes. He was like, 'You never laugh at my jokes.' I'm like, 'I'm laughing inside."'
For his part, Mr. Jost wants to be clear that they don't sit around all day lost in merriment.
"It's not like we're laughing all the time," he said. "We're also figuring a lot of stuff out. We like being around friends who we laugh with, too."
Ms. Johansson said she loves walking around New York, "miles and miles," in her white Hokas, and hanging out in Central Park.
And nobody bothers her?
"No," she said, smiling. "It's New York."
Confirm or Deny
Maureen Dowd: You have an Avengers text chain.
Scarlett Johansson: Yes, that's true. But hopefully, nobody will ever read it. Everything goes on in there. I mean, really. If somebody's gotten terrible reviews, that could be something that comes up. The Avengers, we're like a family. We've been through an incredible experience over a decade plus of time. It was life-changing for all of us. If you text the chain, you can guarantee that within a few minutes, most people will respond, which is great.

It's Love, NASA Style, But Earthbound in the End: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Greg Berlanti's movie, starring Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum as only mildly mismatched lovers, is set against the backdrop of the Apollo 11 landing.
Speaking of the American moon landing of 1969, which he watched on television, Vladimir Nabokov rhapsodized in an interview, that "treading the soil of the moon gives one, I imagine (or rather my projected self imagines) the most remarkable romantic thrill ever experienced in the history of discovery."
In "Fly Me to the Moon," an occasionally engaging comedy set against the backdrop of the Apollo 11 moon landing, the romance is entirely earthbound.
The director is Greg Berlanti, a veteran of swoony prime-time dramas like "Dawson's Creek" and "Riverdale," whose big-screen pictures include the ghastly 2010 rom-com "Life as We Know It" and the surprisingly (and effectively) earnest teenage coming-out comedy-drama "Love, Simon." The script is by Rose Gilroy (she's the daughter of the "Velvet Buzzsaw" auteur Dan Gilroy and the actress Rene Russo) from a story by Bill Kirstein and Keenan Flynn.
But the movie lives and dies with its lead actors, Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum. As lovers who are only mildly mismatched, they never seem to falter, no matter what potentially stupefying paces the movie puts them through.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Johansson is Kelly Jones, or rather, "Kelly Jones," a perky, persistent, charmingly dissembling advertising executive whose pitches are often as phony as her name. Her ignoble hidden past is one reason she accepts a pitch from a shady White House operative, Moe Berkus (Woody Harrelson, slipping into comedic disreputability like he's putting on a comfortable smoking jacket), who knows all about her and offers to make that past disappear if she successfully markets the Apollo 11 mission.
At first it's all relatively harmless "Mad Men" stuff -- getting the astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to do product endorsements. But her assignment gets much dicier when Berkus suggests that Kelly contrive a contingency presentation -- that is, a fake moon landing -- in the event that the intrepid spacemen don't actually make it to their destination.
Tatum is Cole Davis, the mission flight coordinator who, of course, disapproves of the crass commercialism of Kelly's work. But his objections have trouble sticking given that, in their meet-cute encounter at a diner, Davis, in all ignorance of Kelly and what she's up to, blurts that she's the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.
Cole and Kelly's initial exchanges crackle with screwball energy; Johansson's fast-talking dialogue and delivery honor the tradition established by Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn. Tatum's character is, in this same tradition, a bit of a stiff who loosens up after being shaken up; this actor is not Cary Grant, and doesn't try to be, but he's very good at looking silly without acting silly when a scene calls for it.
But as the movie progresses, its story grows convoluted and belabored. The plot-point use of Apollo 1, the disastrous real-life mission that took the lives of three astronauts in 1967, is initially tolerably discreet. But when it's expanded (Cole is haunted because he was also the flight coordinator on that launch, it turns out), it becomes an unpalatable lapse of taste from which the movie has a hard time recovering.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Directed by Greg Berlanti, the film amounts to a Hollywood experiment: Is there still room at the multiplexes for original movies aimed at grown-ups.
"Fly Me to the Moon" is the kind of movie that isn't supposed to succeed in theaters anymore, at least if you listen to franchise-obsessed studio executives.
The story is a period piece and completely original: In 1968, a government operative (Woody Harrelson) hires a marketing virtuoso (Scarlett Johansson) to convince the public -- and Congress -- that a troubled NASA can pull off its scheduled Apollo 11 moon landing. Stylish and devious, she clashes with the rigid launch director (Channing Tatum) and secretly -- as a backup, to be used only in an emergency -- arranges for a fake landing to be filmed on a soundstage. What's the harm?
Hollywood marketers will tell you that ticket buyers eschew movies that mash together genres. And "Fly Me to the Moon" is part drama, part comedic caper, part romance, part fiction and part true story. Particularly in the summer, studios prefer to serve up mindless popcorn movies aimed at teenagers. "Fly Me to the Moon" is entertainment for thinking adults, the kind that Mike Nichols ("Working Girl") and James L. Brooks ("Broadcast News") made in the 1980s.
So the question must be asked: How on earth did "Fly Me to the Moon" manage to score a wide release in theaters at the height of blockbuster season? The film rolls into 3,300 theaters in the United States and Canada on Friday.
Shouldn't it be going straight to streaming?
In many ways, the film's unexpected journey to multiplexes reflects the degree to which Hollywood runs on the vagaries of chance. "Fly Me to the Moon" started out as a streaming movie -- full stop. Apple TV+ paid an estimated $ 100 million for the project in March 2022, and the contract called for no theatrical release of any kind.
But then Greg Berlanti got involved.
It was June 2022, and Mr. Berlanti, the wunderkind television producer, had just turned 50. That milestone prompted a degree of uncomfortable self-reflection, compounded by his mother's recent death. At the same time, the entertainment business was changing -- the streaming-driven "peak TV" era was winding down -- and Mr. Berlanti wasn't entirely sure where to focus his professional attention.
He knew he had grown weary of shows based on comic books, having spent a decade working on hits like "Riverdale," "Arrow," "The Flash" and "Supergirl." He had also done television thrillers ("You"), family dramas ("Brothers & Sisters") and torrents of teen angst ("Everwood," "Dawson's Creek").
"I started getting these lifetime achievement honors, which were very nice, but they also made me reflective about what I wanted the back half of my career to be," Mr. Berlanti said. "Am I done? I don't want to be done."
Then a movie script landed in his inbox. It was from Ms. Johansson, who suddenly needed a director for "Fly Me to the Moon," which she was also producing. The initial director, Jason Bateman, had abruptly left the project ("creative differences"), and filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta in four short months. Ms. Johansson had gotten to know Mr. Berlanti a few years earlier while kicking around a new take on "Little Shop of Horrors," the classic musical. (She was going to star as Audrey, with Mr. Berlanti directing; the pandemic derailed the plan.)
"I needed someone who could deliver," Ms. Johansson said. "Greg has such empathy. He's so sensitive. He understands comedy. He's a mensch. He's efficient. He's a little naughty, but a little prude. He was perfect for the material -- and, as it turned out, the timing was perfect for him."
Still, there was risk. Mr. Berlanti had previously directed only two studio films, and both were smaller in scale. "Love, Simon," a celebrated 2018 rom-com centered on a gay teenager, cost $ 17 million to make and took in $ 66 million. "Life as We Know It," a poorly reviewed 2010 comedy, cost $ 38 million and took in $ 106 million.
"I don't direct that much," Mr. Berlanti said. "It's really not something I wake up thinking about -- directing. But I found myself at a moment in my career when I wanted to do something that would use up all the parts of me and challenge me in every way, not just one or two ways."
He continued: "I also missed movies that blended comedy and drama and were original and smart and vehicles for amazing actors. No one is doing them anymore. I knew why: box office prospects. But this movie was supposed to go straight to streaming. I thought, 'Oh, this is great. There are much lower stakes."'
He took the gig.
Mr. Berlanti delivered "Fly Me to the Moon" to executives at Apple in the spring of last year. Next came a test screening in Colorado. "It scored very well with male and female, young and old, which came as a bit of a surprise," Mr. Berlanti said. (Apple declined to comment for this article.)
Maybe the response was a fluke? Another audience test was conducted in California. "Same response, in fact even better," Mr. Berlanti said. Still another was ordered up in Texas. "Everywhere we went, people responded by saying it was the kind of movie they missed in theaters -- original with big movie stars," he said.
The film's producers, led by Ms. Johansson, pushed Apple to give "Fly Me to the Moon" a chance in theaters. Apple agreed. "It was both exciting and terrifying," Mr. Berlanti said, breaking into nervous laughter.
Warner Bros. declined to bid for theatrical distribution rights. Universal was interested but ultimately bowed out, citing a full release schedule, as did Paramount, according to three people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. Disney was not a fit because it focuses almost exclusively on franchises.
In the end, it was one executive -- Sony's movie chairman, Tom Rothman -- who made the difference. "I wanted this movie for a simple reason: I enjoyed the hell out of it," Mr. Rothman said. "It's a real credit to Greg's direction. It was a very high degree of difficulty, balancing the tone, and he did it beautifully."
Mr. Rothman has been vocal in recent years about a need for traditional studios to embrace a mix of films, not just sequels and superheroes. Sony, for instance, released the romantic comedy "Anyone but You" in theaters in December. It arrived to $ 8 million in opening-weekend ticket sales and collected $ 220 million by the end of its run (after costing $ 25 million to make). No romantic comedy has been given a wide release in theaters since.
"It's not about opening weekend for these movies," Mr. Rothman said. "You have to nurture them and allow word-of-mouth to kick in."
July offered a counterprogramming opportunity for "Fly Me to the Moon," he added. Next weekend, Universal will release "Twisters," an action remake reliant on computer-generated visual effects. Then comes the Marvel superhero sequel "Deadpool & Wolverine."
"Older audiences don't evaporate in the summer," Mr. Rothman said. "It's just that the business doesn't give them much to watch." Box office analysts expect "Fly Me to the Moon" to arrive to roughly $ 12 million in weekend ticket sales, which would result in a second-place opening behind "Despicable Me 4."
Reviews for "Fly Me to the Moon" have been solid, if not exceptional. Will the people who say they want original movies come out to support "Fly Me to the Moon" over the longer haul?
Mr. Berlanti responded with an emphatic yes. "It's a feel-good movie, which is an antidote for how a lot of people are feeling right now," he said. (His career is fine either way; his production company has more than 20 projects in the works, including two new dramas headed to NBC in the fall and a live-action Scooby-Doo series for Netflix.)
Ms. Johansson was a bit more circumspect.
"I guess we'll see," she said. "You have to keep trying."

Messy Love Is OK at 26, She Sings: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The rising country star writes about disastrous love and learning big lessons with charm, wit and solid hooks. Her new LP, "Am I Okay?," is due Friday.
The budding country star Megan Moroney was 36 stories above Times Square last month, waiting to meet some of her biggest fans, who were among the first invited to hear "Am I Okay?," her eagerly anticipated second album.
As she prepared to greet her guests in the glass aviary atop the Hard Rock Hotel, Moroney admitted she'd culled them via social media, group chats and meet and greets. "They don't know I stalk them," she said after slipping into a cobalt mini dress from Zara and a pair of metallic Balmain stiletto boots. Her hair teased into a butter-blond cloud, she joked, "It's 20 pounds of hair and 10 pounds of makeup." It's a look her fans recreate to varying degrees, but they're also drawn to the way Moroney embraces the moments most people airbrush out of their Instagram-perfect lives.
One example is the closer of "Am I Okay?," which is due on Friday: the spare, simple "Hell of a Show." It's just a verse and a chorus, a raw artist singing over an acoustic guitar about being jerked around by a self-absorbed boyfriend, pulling it together to slay a crowd of people who "love me better than you could've," but still crying herself to sleep.
It's hard to believe there's anyone who isn't clamoring for the attention of this 26-year-old rising songwriter. Moroney was the leading female nominee at the Academy of Country Music Awards this spring, competing for top prizes alongside Kacey Musgraves and Lainey Wilson. Her rocket-ship trajectory began with "Tennessee Orange" in 2022, a Romeo and Juliet ballad for fans of SEC football, which earned her 18 record company offers and nominations for both the A.C.M.s' and the Country Music Association Awards' song of the year. (She ultimately signed with Sony's Nashville and Columbia's New York divisions.)
Two years ago, when Moroney released her first EP, she seemed like just another attractive Nashville hopeful in a city overstocked with them. At least on paper. But she had ideas about how to become a star, and they started with her songwriting. Wry, vulnerable and a real reflection of how 20-somethings drink and wreck their hearts, Moroney's songs are authentic in a way the Music Row system can rarely access.
Juli Griffith, a three-decade publishing veteran who is now Moroney's manager, recalled listening to her for the first time and thinking, "My God! That broken voice. You just believed her, and it struck you and stuck with you."
Moroney, who grew up in Douglasville, Ga., didn't drink in high school and dated her brother's best friend for two years -- until he dumped her when he went to college. That first heartbreak shattered her, but also provided resilience when she realized she could survive.
She attended the University of Georgia and majored in accounting, getting a music business certificate in the process. Her parents wouldn't allow her to drop out to pursue songwriting, so Moroney, who graduated with a 3.9, pledged Kappa Delta and doubled down on college life. She started writing songs, but not telling people. After the bro-country star Chase Rice saw her playing a set of covers before the singer Jon Langston performed at a sorority charity event, he asked her to open for him at Athens's Georgia Theater, with one condition: She had to write an original song.
"In those four years, I grew up so much as a person, learned so much about who I am," she said. "Everything you go through in college, between the heartbreaks and being so drunk that you're literally fighting for your life on a curb, head between your legs -- that builds character."
Some emerging female artists would hesitate to be that candid. But Moroney's brand of truth-telling, equally funny and wounded, has struck a chord. "If you get a little too drunk and call your ex, like, whatever," she said. "I think that's all normal and human."
As she prepped for the Hard Rock event, Moroney discussed the artists who have provided her with inspiration. She was raised on a diet of John Prine, Eagles, Emmylou Harris and J.D. Souther by her father, and said her glammed-up look was partly a representation of a distinctly feminine power.
"I've always loved the way Dolly and Kacey have their hair up to the ceiling, you know?," she said, referring to Parton and Musgraves. "It's like they can say whatever they want, dressed like that."
"Am I Okay?," the follow-up to "Lucky" from last year, charts phases of several failed relationships, including one with a "Mr. Right" that was over before recording began; he inspired the title track's euphoric vertigo of seemingly finding the one. "That started out really great, then was like, 'Wait! This is actually pretty horrible,"' she said, laughing about the whiplash.
The new songs run an emotional gauntlet. There's the too-good-to-be-true steel guitar celebration "Third Time's the Charm"; a darker, minimalist track called "I Know You" that skewers a cheating soon-to-be-ex with layers of harmony that echo like voices in one's head; and "Indifferent," which grows from acoustic to bombastic as Moroney bids a relationship goodbye with a dismissive wave.
"It's like I'm 26, dating people, and you're going to be wrong," she said. "OK, fine. That's the point: It happened, and I'm OK. It's happening to someone right now, thinking this is the one. They're not, and it's going to be OK."
Kristian Bush, Moroney's producer (and half of the Grammy-winning country act Sugarland), joined her in New York for the event. Moroney, who had been a publishing intern at his publishing company in Marietta, Ga., called Bush shortly after she moved to Nashville, and he swung into action. "When Megan told me what she was doing, I got very protective and called Juli, my longtime publisher," he said. "Meg was a pretty girl, and I know how those rooms can be; Juli was the only one I trusted."
Once convinced of Moroney's work ethic, Griffith signed on as her manager and set up recording sessions with people who "would let Meg lead," which included Jessi Alexander, Luke Laird and Jessie Jo Dillon, the daughter of the Country Music Hall of Fame inductee Dean Dillon, who all have multiple writing credits on "Okay?" In the recording studio, Moroney prefers older-school processes to assemble a sound she calls "a vintage car that flies": actual musicians playing together instead of relying on drum machines, computer tracks and overdubbed instruments. (She has branded her sound "emo cowgirl country.")
"I know in my songs there's a lot of I'm bringing men down," Moroney said, adding that she'd only been in love three times. "But I always make jokes to the audience, 'Clearly, I love men, because I keep coming back and I keep trying. It just keeps not working out."'
Her honesty and wit have turned even casual listeners into loyal fans. At the Hard Rock, around 40 arrived from as far away as Arizona, California, Florida and even Canada. Some wore T-shirts with Moroney's picture and the words "Feminine Rage." After gathering in a room filled with cobalt and silver heart-shaped balloons, Moroney played all 14 songs and offered (at times laughing) commentary. The already released singles had everyone singing along with gusto, and "Heaven by Noon," a ballad inspired by an uneventful last conversation between her aunt and uncle on Sept. 11, hours before his death in the attack on the World Trade Center, brought even the men in the room to tears. (They cried at some of the relationship songs, too.)
Moroney will be bringing the music to many more people at headlining shows this summer, along with her ongoing opening slot on Kenny Chesney's stadium and amphitheater tour, and she'll be paying attention to the details. If her dating life has been a minefield, she believes using the shrapnel for her career is intentional: "Things don't happen to me, they happen for me," she said. And there have been important lessons in the highs and lows of her personal and professional lives so far.
"To me, the strong people can look at the sad situation, and be like, 'That was really messed up. You hurt my feelings.' Maybe I'll have a song and be vulnerable by saying that," she said. "But, also, I'll follow it up with a song that's like 'I'm going to be just fine. Don't worry about it."'

Japan, at Last, Is Phasing Out Its Floppy Disks: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One of the world's most technologically advanced nations has held on to some of the most outmoded devices.
Japan scrapped every regulation requiring the use of floppy disks for administrative purposes this week, catching up with the times 13 years after the country's producers manufactured their last units.
The floppy disk, invented in the 1970s, was once a ubiquitous part of computing. Other forms of memory like flash drives and internet cloud storage have since taken over. In the 1990s, along with the cassette tape, it was inching toward the dustbin of outdated tech.
But not in Japan. While renowned for its consumer electronics giants, robots and some of the world's fastest broadband networks, the country has also been wedded to floppy disks and other old technologies like fax machines and cash.
Japan began moving away from the 20th-century storage devices, magnetic disks encased in plastic, just two years ago, when Taro Kono, the country's digital minister, declared a "war on floppy disks."
When he encountered an image of a highway billboard for an American cancer clinic that read, "If you know what a floppy disk is it may be time for your cancer screening," Mr. Kono responded on social media: "No, not necessarily in Japan."
In the southern town of Tsuwano, officials in the accounting department replaced its stack of floppy disks only in April 2023, according to Nobuyuki Koto, one of the officials.
The town's new database took some time to set up, but the switch was inevitable and the new system is speedier and more accurate, he said.
A wide spectrum of businesses -- mines, oil companies, retailers, liquor shops, shopping centers -- was bound by different rules requiring them to submit documents to regulators on floppy disks.
Even after Sony, once a major manufacturer of the disks for the Japanese market, stopped producing them in 2011, more than 1,000 floppy-mandating laws, ordinances and directives stayed on the books, according to the Digital Ministry.
On Wednesday, Mr. Kono declared victory in his war. All those regulations have been reviewed by lawmakers, undergone public comment, been voted on and struck down, he said.
The last rule standing was related to the recycling of used vehicles and was repealed on June 28, he said.
Outside the government, some Japanese sectors aren't ready to let go.
Most of the traditional textile industry in a section of Kyoto, which makes items like kimonos, has not updated its technology since adopting floppy disks in the 1980s, said Motoshi Honda, an analyst at the Kyoto Municipal Industrial Technology Research Institute.
Each day, Higo Bank, a regional financial institution on the island of Kyushu, processes nearly 300 floppy disks, which weigh in at almost 10 pounds, according to Yusuke Murayama, a spokesman for the bank.
The bank has tried to persuade the clients still using the disks to store their bank account information to switch formats, telling them it would stop accepting them in the spring, he said.
Floppy disks are still around outside Japan, too. The embroidery and avionics industries use them, and until recently the United States' nuclear arsenal did, too.
Within the government, Mr. Kono's work is not done. He has indicated that fax machines, still widely used in Japan, are in his sights. He recommended switching to email.
In Tsuwano, the town whose accounting department upgraded from floppy disks last year, the office fax machine is still often the fastest way to send information, Mr. Koto, the town official, said. Officials fax the names of people who have died to newspaper obituary departments and use the machines to correspond with local businesses.
"Sometimes, people don't notice emails," Mr. Koto said.
But even after finally getting rid of the floppy disks, he missed some things about the old system.
"There wasn't any risk of getting hacked," he said. "Now we have to be careful about data security."

Inspiring, Even After 200 Years: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Beethoven's aspirational vision of unity and peace can be applied to virtually any situation or place. The music makes sure of that.
Even if you don't know Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, you probably know its finale, the famous "Ode to Joy."
Written 200 years ago, the "Ode" is crafted like the best of pop songs, with easily hummable, simple phrases that use the same techniques you hear in a Taylor Swift hit today.
But the "Ode" is more than pop. It's a supranational anthem that aspires to a world in which "all men become brothers," as its lyrics say. Its message, taken from a poem by Friedrich Schiller, is so broad and welcoming, so unspecific, that it has been taken up by an extraordinarily broad array of people and political causes.
Since its premiere, the "Ode" has become shorthand for unity and hope, whether sincere or ironic. Sunny lyrics like "Be embraced, oh you millions!" and "Here's a kiss for the entire world" have made it a fixture of the Olympics. It has been adopted by both oppressive regimes and the people who protest them. It sarcastically accompanies terror in "A Clockwork Orange" and "Die Hard," but innocently entertains infants on "Baby Einstein" albums and in a sketch by the Muppets.
Why does this song still have such a hold on the world?
The answer starts with the music. Beethoven didn't always write tuneful melodies, but he certainly knew how. He arranged popular songs, and composed memorable themes like the four-note opening of the Fifth Symphony. Nothing, though, is as brazenly catchy as the "Ode to Joy."
Beethoven designed it to be easily sung and hard to forget. It is in common time, with four beats per measure, and unfolds in neat, four-bar phrases. Often, there is one note for each syllable of text, and, crucially, the range is an octave, with the melodic line moving either up or down the scale. People with no musical training can learn this almost immediately, unlike with most national anthems. "The Star-Spangled Banner," for example, has a wide range and awkward leaps that trip up even professional singers.
This simple song, though, was revolutionary. Before 1824, no symphony had included a chorus. And in Beethoven's Ninth, it comes out of nowhere. The first three movements are purely instrumental, and the finale starts in a similar vein.
That last movement begins with what Wagner, who was heavily influenced by the Ninth, later called the "terror fanfare," a crashing theme that gives way to a recitative response, a declamatory style resembling human speech, in the cellos and basses. Those instruments seem to defy the fanfare, behaving like a dissatisfied listener saying: "No, thank you. Next!"
The orchestra answers with a snippet of the symphony's first movement, but the cellos and basses reject that too. They do the same with bits of the second and the third movements. Then, a hint of the "Ode" is received warmly, so it builds until it includes the entire ensemble.
Before the jubilation can get carried away, the terror fanfare returns. This time, though, it is not cut off by cellos and basses, but by a baritone soloist. He breaks the fourth wall, standing in for Beethoven and performing text written by the composer, as he exclaims, "Oh friends, not these sounds!" He calls for more cheerful music instead. The chorus responds with cries of "Joy!," and the soloist begins the "Ode" proper.
◆
The "Ode" is a setting of Schiller's "An die Freude," or "To Joy." (The word "ode" was added for Beethoven's symphony.) Schiller wrote it in the style of a "geselliges Lied," a kind of social drinking song with verses and choruses. Sprawling and based on Enlightenment ideals like trust in reason, democracy and quality, it portrays facets of joy, which Schiller refers to as the "daughter of Elysium."
When this poem was written, in 1785, Beethoven was growing up in Bonn, Germany, a progressive city swirling with the tenets of the Enlightenment that influenced Schiller and, earlier, American independence. Schiller revised his text in 1803, disillusioned by the bloody French Revolution of the 1790s and believing that his earlier version had become detached from reality. Lines that were once incendiary were tamped down; "Beggars become brothers of princes" turned into "All men become brothers." Still, he dismissed the poem as a lapse in judgment, politically and artistically.
Beethoven must have been aware of the poem's flaws; when he composed his setting, he took from both versions, and even then only bits and pieces. But he was still devoted to the Enlightenment, especially in the face of revolution and resurging autocracy. He much preferred, he wrote in a letter, "the empire of the mind," which he regarded as "the highest of all spiritual and worldly monarchies."
If his decision to end his Ninth Symphony with a choir and vocal soloists was radical, so was what he did with his setting of the poem. Beethoven came of age in music's Classical era, in which symphonies often followed similar structures: a sonata-form first movement, a slow second, a minuet third and a fast, rousing finale.
The Ninth does away with many of those conventions, retaining some elements of Classical style while blazing a path for the Romantic period that followed. Unfurling over 20 minutes, its "Ode" looks like recognizable forms while resisting categorization. With a remarkably free spirit, the music comments on the poem's text and spins fantasies from it, as the historian Harvey Sachs has written.
Those fantasies most closely resemble a theme and variations, a musical form in which a melody is put through a series of stylistic transformations; the melody, in this case, is the famous song we know as the "Ode." After it is first presented, Beethoven writes a topsy-turvy, bacchic version of it. Instead of one note per syllable, there are now two, rising and falling, as if performed by a drunken singer incapable of steadiness. But at the mention of God, the music becomes awe-inspiringly mighty, with beaming focus. It sounds like an ending, but after a pause, the instruments of a military band enter with a Turkish march: a non sequitur with a touch of kitsch, perhaps, or parody.
Or maybe it's a harbinger of war, because next, a battle begins: one of keys, and by proxy the spirit, represented by a fugue, from which the radiant key of D emerges with the biggest treatment yet of the "Ode" melody. The only thing left, after all that, is to celebrate.
With the sound of sacred music, the tenors and basses, doubled by deep-voiced instruments in the orchestra, enter with the phrase "Be embraced, you millions!" In the next section, Beethoven includes the word "devout" in his instructions to the musicians, and listeners can hear a move toward the divine, "beyond the starry canopy," as Schiller describes the realm of "the Creator." Celestial awe gives way to a double fugue of holy grandeur.
Once again, the piece seems to have reached a conclusion, but it keeps going. The vocal soloists enter, repeating text from the beginning that sets up a return to the line "All men become brothers" and the escalation of a proper coda. Beethoven brings back the military instruments, and the chorus sings the first line of the "Ode" at full power: "Joy, beauteous spark of divinity." You can picture him almost warming up for a new section, but the orchestra manically, breathlessly brings down the curtain as if to shut down an argument that could go on forever.
Historically, a kind of argument did go on. Theist without being attached to any faith, as political as a "Coexist" bumper sticker, the "Ode" has been adopted across ideologies, with the music's vision of Elysium changing in the eye of each beholder.
That is why it has been used both as Nazi propaganda, even a birthday treat for Hitler, and as a cleansing start to a new era decades later. Leonard Bernstein, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, led a performance in the former East Berlin in which he replaced the word "Freude" with "Freiheit," or "Freedom." (The Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra has done something similar; last year, it premiered a Ukrainian translation of the Schiller text into Ukrainian, with the key word being "slava," or "glory," as in the slogan "Glory to Ukraine!")
More often than not, the "Ode" signifies hope. Women in Chile sang a version while protesting the Pinochet regime's role in the disappearances and deaths of their loved ones. In Japan, the piece has traditionally been programmed on New Year's Eve as a symbol of rebirth, with choirs made up of thousands of amateurs; for the opening of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Seiji Ozawa led a performance that brought in singers from around the world.
But because this music is so familiar, if not overexposed, it can be used cynically. About a decade ago, there was a wave of ostensibly inspiring "Ode to Joy" flash mob videos on YouTube, including one that has been viewed nearly 100 million times. In the end, though, that feel-good performance was just dubious viral marketing for a Spanish bank.
It's no wonder that some critics have viewed the "Ode to Joy" as too accessible for its own good. Yet that very quality is what keeps it so present and ever-changing. We still recognize, and hear, this music because it's an earworm for the ages and it's something to believe in. What that belief is, we may not always get right. But Beethoven must have known, as he kept putting his theme through variations and insisting that "All men become brothers," that Elysium will forever be a work in progress.

Full text: The parent company of Redbox, which rents movies through kiosks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday.
Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, the parent company of the movie rental company Redbox, which is known for its distinctive red kiosks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday.
In the filing, Chicken Soup listed debts of about $ 970 million, and total assets of about $ 414 million. It owes millions to entertainment and media companies, including Universal Studios, Sony Pictures and BBC Studios Americas, as well as some retailers, such as Walgreens and Walmart, according to court filings.
Chicken Soup for the Soul was founded in 1993 by two motivational speakers, Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen. The company's inspirational book series, with titles like "From Lemons to Lemonade" and "Angels Among Us," contains collections of stories for specific audiences, for example new mothers or cat lovers.
Its original book, published more than 30 years ago, dispensed life advice and stories of overcoming obstacles with the hope that it would heal readers' souls just as "chicken soup has a healing effect on the body of the ill."
The company, which has published more than 300 titles, has sold more than 500 million copies worldwide.
Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment is separate from its book-publishing arm, which is unaffected by the bankruptcy filing. It was not immediately clear whether the Chapter 11 filing would affect the Redbox operation. The company declined to comment on Sunday.
In 2022, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment acquired Redbox, a business founded in 2002 and recognized for its bright red DVD rental kiosks outside supermarkets and pharmacies. Redbox has about 27,000 kiosks across the United States.
William J. Rouhana Jr. became the company's chief executive in 2008 and ran the company with his wife, Amy Newmark, the publisher and editor in chief of the book division.
Mr. Rouhana tried to expand the company into different products, including a line of soups, which ultimately failed. He founded the entertainment division of Chicken Soup for the Soul in 2016.
The company requested relief to pay its employees, which it has been unable to do "for the two-week period ending on June 14, 2024." Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment has about 1,000 full- and part-time workers.
The company reported $ 636 million in net income loss in 2023, compared with $ 111 million in 2022, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. At the time that Chicken Soup for the Soul acquired Redbox, the movie rental company had more than $ 300 million in debt.

Assange's Role as Father Of the Digital Bombshell: [News Analysis]

Full text: In his brazen quest for total transparency, the WikiLeaks founder paved the way for a world in which no secret is safe and no institution trusted.
On the morning of April 5, 2010, a tall, thin man with a shock of silver hair walked up to a lectern at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. He'd been operating an obscure news website out of Iceland for four years, trying and failing to find a scoop that would set the world on fire. Many of the 40 or so journalists (myself included) who showed up had barely heard of him.
Still, it was hard to ignore his pitch. Three days earlier, we had received an email promising a "previously unseen classified video" with "dramatic proof and new facts."
But even this bit of hype might have undersold what happened after the man, Julian Assange, pressed play. The nature of proof -- the volume and granularity of digital evidence, along with the pathways through which it comes to light -- was about to change.
Before, information that leaked from insiders to the public was largely circumscribed by the limitations of paper. In 1969, it had taken Daniel Ellsberg an entire night to surreptitiously photocopy a secret study of the Vietnam War that would become known as the Pentagon Papers.
Now, thousands of such documents -- along with images, videos, spreadsheets, email spools, source code and chat logs -- could be dragged onto a USB stick and transmitted across the globe in a matter of seconds. Find an insider with enough access or a hacker with enough talent and any security system could be broken. Sources could be obscured. All that was missing was a middleman -- a publisher who could find leaks, post the stuff and then take the heat after it went live.
Mr. Assange's video had an incendiary title, "Collateral Murder." It began with a still photo of a son holding a picture of his dead father, a driver for the news agency Reuters, followed by leaked footage from a 2007 airstrike showing an American helicopter shooting and killing a Reuters photographer and driver on a street in Baghdad.
There was the drawling voice of a U.S. soldier referring to a man hundreds of feet below -- one of the Reuters employees killed in the attack -- with an expletive. The video appeared to contradict an account given by a Pentagon spokesman, who had claimed the airstrike was a part of "combat operations against a hostile force." Within hours, the story had been picked up by Al Jazeera, MSNBC and The New York Times.
What followed was a chain of seismic revelations, some by Mr. Assange's site, WikiLeaks, some by other outlets. It continues to this day: A trove of State Department cables published by WikiLeaks in conjunction with The Times (2010-11), Edward Snowden's disclosures from the National Security Agency (2013), the Sony Pictures hack (2014), the Drone Papers (2015), the Panama Papers (2016), hacked emails of the Democratic National Committee (2016), details of U.S. offensive cyberprograms (2017), Hunter Biden's laptop (2020) and the Facebook Files (2021), to name a few.
Looking back, it's easy to see Mr. Assange as the father of the digital revolution in leaking. At the time, he was something closer to a talented promoter, one who managed to position himself at the center of several currents that started to converge around the turn of the millennium.
"In the late 1990s and early 2000s, people were hacking into systems and they were taking documents, but those hackers were not ideologically inclined to hack and leak," said Gabriella Coleman, a professor of anthropology at Harvard whose new book, "Weapons of the Geek," will include two chapters on the history of hacking and leaking.
Mr. Assange was the first to figure out how to bring its fruits to the big audiences reached by traditional news media. Even as his legal saga reaches its end with his guilty plea and return to Australia, it's clear that his larger legacy -- the volatile fusion of illicit hack-and-leak methods with the reach and credibility of established U.S. publishers -- is still unfolding.
On Wednesday, Mr. Assange pleaded guilty to conspiring with one of his sources, Chelsea Manning, to obtain and publish government secrets in violation of the Espionage Act. Ben Wizner, who leads the free speech, privacy and technology project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the conviction could have far-reaching consequences.
"This was the first time in modern American history where we saw the publication of truthful information criminalized," said Mr. Wizner. "That it hadn't happened before was not necessarily because of law. It was probably because of custom. That custom depended on a relationship between the media and the government, an understanding that while they might have different ideas of what the public interest was, they both had a fundamentally American sense of what the public interest was. Then WikiLeaks comes along. Their view is that American imperialism is the greatest threat to world peace. It's a view of the public interest that is radically different from the U.S. state, and that puts pressure on the old consensus."
On a rudimentary level, Mr. Assange's activities largely resembled that of the traditional news media. He was gathering and publishing authentic, newsworthy information. His objectives, however, were different.
Rather than making a claim to neutrality or objectivity, Mr. Assange styled himself as a warrior, sworn to the cause of radical transparency. He refused to accept that even democratic governments required some amount of secrecy to function. Instead, he sought to, in his words, "shift regime behavior" by making secrecy itself untenable. In its place would arise the "people's will to truth, love and self-realization."
It was a utopian vision, more of an excuse than an argument. One of the contradictions of Mr. Assange's criminal case is how much his freedom depended on precisely the kind of backroom diplomatic dealings that he had spent years working to deride and expose.
As director of national intelligence under President Barack Obama, James R. Clapper Jr. dealt with the aftermath of many hack-and-leak episodes. In an interview over email, he rejected the notion that Mr. Assange's disclosures had changed anyone's mind about the morality of the U.S. intelligence apparatus. Instead, he said, WikiLeaks merely served to reinforce the pre-existing views of the faction who already believed that U.S. spy agencies were "evil."
"I don't think it moved the needle one way or the other," he said.
Still, Ms. Coleman said, the history of leaking is still being written, in part by organizations like Distributed Denial of Secrets and XnetLeaks. Like WikiLeaks, these sites solicit and post high-volume digital leaks. But they have higher standards when it comes to redacting information and vetting sources.
As for Mr. Assange, he was "engaging in a very bold experiment," Ms. Coleman said. "Experiments are bound to have successes and failures. But you needed someone to be bold and go for it."

Michael Jackson Died With More Than $500 Million in Debt: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Jackson owed about $ 40 million to the tour promoter A.E.G. in 2009, his estate's executors said in a court filing. They said all the debts have been eliminated.
Michael Jackson's debts and creditor's claims at the time of his death in 2009 totaled more than $ 500 million, according to a court filing by the pop superstar's estate that provides details of his financial woes toward the end of his life.
Jackson owed about $ 40 million to the tour promoter A.E.G., according to the filing, which was made in Los Angeles County Superior Court this month and earlier reported by People magazine. The filing said that 65 creditors made claims against the singer after his death, some of which resulted in lawsuits, and that some of his debt had been "accruing interest at extremely high interest rates."
A representative for the Jackson estate, which is executed by John Branca and John McClain, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The estate filed the court papers as a request to authorize the payment of about $ 3.5 million to several legal firms for their work in the second half of 2018.
In the court filing, the executors say that they have eliminated the estate's debt and that almost all of the creditors' claims and litigation have been resolved.
Jackson earned hundreds of millions of dollars throughout the 1980s and 1990s as the creator of some of the biggest-selling albums of all time, along with dazzling concert tours that filled stadiums around the world. He bought the Beatles' song catalog for $ 47.5 million in 1985 and later sold it to Sony/ATV Music in exchange for a 50 percent share in the company. Sony bought back the estate's share for $ 750 million in 2016.
But when Jackson died at the age of 50, shortly before he was supposed to embark on a live residency called This Is It, he left behind a tangled web of assets and liabilities.
Jackson was famous for his lavish lifestyle and spent money with abandon. He incurred millions of dollars in debt from his Neverland Ranch estate in Southern California and had a penchant for expensive art, jewelry and private jets. He was paying more than $ 30 million annually on interest payments, a forensic accountant testified during a 2013 wrongful-death trial in which A.E.G. prevailed.
The Jackson estate is currently in a dispute with the I.R.S. after a tax audit. In a separate court filing this year, the estate said that the federal agency accused it of undervaluing its assets and said it owed "an additional $ 700 million in taxes and penalties."

Long To-Do List for the Boston Symphony: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Chad Smith, the orchestra's new chief executive, hopes to return the storied ensemble to its groundbreaking roots while moving it forward.
"I'm going to sound like such a dork," Chad Smith said as he drove a golf cart around the grounds of Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's pastoral summer home in the Berkshires. "I love Tanglewood so much."
He stopped the cart, and looked out beyond the manicured campus to rolling, tree-covered hills and the still waters of Stockbridge Bowl. It reminded him, he said, of the environment at the prestigious Salzburg Festival in Austria. But Salzburg isn't attached to an orchestra and a music institute like Tanglewood has been since its founding in 1940.
"This is the sense of innovation that is at the core of the B.S.O," said Smith, who became the Boston Symphony's president and chief executive in the fall. "The orchestra was not yet 60 years old, and it changed its identity again by becoming a symphony orchestra, a pops orchestra and an educational institution."
Gesturing to Stockbridge Bowl, he added: "And it has a beach. What other orchestra has a beach?"
Smith has big plans for Tanglewood, whose Boston Symphony season begins on July 5, just as he has a long to-do list for the ensemble at home. History would suggest that he isn't just dreaming: He came to Boston from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, where for two decades he played a crucial role in building the orchestra's reputation as one of the most innovative, important ensembles in the country.
When he announced that he was leaving for Boston last year, Smith, 52, had risen through the ranks of the Philharmonic to became its chief executive in 2019. His departure was a shock to Angelenos, and to some signaled a crisis for the Philharmonic, which shortly before had found out that it was losing its starry maestro, Gustavo Dudamel, to the New York Philharmonic.
The Boston Symphony was also in a state of crisis. It had seen a period of comfortable stability, even complacency, under Mark Volpe's leadership for 23 years. When he retired, in 2021, he was succeeded by Gail Samuel, another Los Angeles Philharmonic veteran, who resigned after 18 months.
"We had gone through a lot of tumult," said Barbara W. Hostetter, the chair of the Boston Symphony's board. "So we decided that we no longer had the opportunity to look outside the box. We needed an experienced orchestra C.E.O."
Hostetter knew Smith, and was encouraged to see his name on a search firm's short list of candidates. The Boston Symphony may have once shaped American classical music, but it had become old-fashioned compared with the country's other top ensembles. She thought that he might be exactly what it needed to recover, if not thrive.
"More recently there's been an emphasis on tradition," Smith said, "but innovation was the founding principle. In the first part of the 20th century, I don't know that there was an orchestra that commissioned a body of work as enduring as the B.S.O.'s."
Smith visited Boston and met with Andris Nelsons, the orchestra's music director. They spoke "about the necessity and the mission to embrace the tradition," Nelsons said, "and to continue that, but bring it forward."
By the end of his trip, Smith was, to his surprise, open to taking the job. "I was comfortable with the arc of the work I had done in L.A.," he said. "I was excited by the opportunity that this orchestra put in front of me. The B.S.O. is probably the only other orchestra I would have left L.A. for."
It's Smith's job to say things like that, but his feelings about the Boston Symphony come from personal history. Los Angeles may have been his home for more than 20 years, but he grew up in Pennsylvania, before moving to Boston to study voice at the New England Conservatory and Tufts University. The Boston Symphony was the orchestra he heard as a student; he performed at Symphony Hall; he was even a fellow at Tanglewood.
He knows Boston well, and he knows that Boston isn't Los Angeles. Smith isn't looking to replicate his work at the Philharmonic, but elements of its spirit will inform the changes he has planned for the Boston Symphony.
For example, he and his colleagues in Los Angeles tapped into the city's distinction as a creative center. During the pandemic, streamed performances features included a conversation between Dudamel and the film director Alejandro González Iñárritu. With the experimental opera company the Industry, the orchestra presented John Cage's "Europeras 1 & 2" at Sony Pictures Studios.
Boston, on the other hand, is an academic center. As the conductor Thomas Wilkins, who holds a conducting post at the Boston Symphony and has worked with Smith at the Hollywood Bowl, said, "He's got the luxury of now living in one of the most intellectual towns in America, if not on the planet."
Smith has already announced plans that tap into the city's concentration of academic institutions. Among them is the creation of the Boston Symphony Orchestra Humanities Institute, an initiative to develop programming with people beyond the walls of Symphony Hall, and beyond music.
"Orchestras aren't just about music," said the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who lives in the Boston area. "At its best, an orchestra is a meeting place for ideas, for democratic exchange, for creating the shared meaning that makes our communities strong. This belief -- that music is service -- is in the Boston Symphony Orchestra's founding DNA, and it's a purpose that I see guiding the B.S.O. today."
(The humanities institute was unveiled in a wave of news that included the move of Nelsons's contract to a rolling, evergreen one and his added title as head of conducting at Tanglewood. Smith also founded a composing chair, which will be occupied by Carlos Simon starting this fall.)
Smith's leadership will trickle down to programming; he is especially interested in festivals that, he said, "explore topics and trends in a way that are meaningful, over multiple years." But, because of classical music's long planning cycles, his stamp won't be entirely felt on the orchestra's repertoire until the 2025-26 season. Still, he is already working with the Boston Symphony to shape its ethos and marketing.
"I'm being asked a lot, 'When will we get back to prepandemic?"' Smith said. (In fiscal year 2023, attendance for Boston Symphony concerts was down 23 percent from 2019.) "We'll get there, but I'm aiming for something a lot healthier. We have to re-center audiences in our decision-making, and retool programming."
Part of that work is a fresh look at the subscription model that long provided financial security for orchestras, but which has failed in recent years. "The pandemic just ripped the floor out," he said. "It's a massive impact, financially, but it's also a huge opportunity."
In a subscription model, programs need to have broad appeal, with a trusted formula. But if an orchestra shifts its focus to single-ticket sales, concerts can become "more curated experiences," Smith said. A niche evening that wouldn't sell out three performances might find success as a one-night event, while a Rachmaninoff war horse played by a star virtuoso might receive three or four shows.
Targeted programming could allow for the kind of risk-taking that has been somewhat absent at the Boston Symphony. Smith said he hoped it would make for a kind of sandbox that artists could "come and play in": people from the city's various communities, say, or Simon in his composer role.
Gabriela Ortiz, a composer whom Smith and Dudamel championed in Los Angeles, and whose ballet score "Revolución Diamantina" is coming to the Boston Symphony next season, described Smith as a leader who is truly engaged with artists. In Los Angeles, she said, he sat in on as many rehearsals of her new music as he could. And they would talk about how to take classical music out of the concert hall.
"He was very aware that to expand the audience, you had to be open to risks and experiments," Ortiz said. "That's why I believe L.A. is one of the orchestras that looks to the future. I don't know Boston yet, but Chad invited me. He wants to bring new voices."
Ortiz's music was included in the Boston Symphony's Concert for the City in May, a free event that brought in community organizations and young artists to share Symphony Hall's public spaces, and its stage, with the orchestra. (The first Concert for the City, last year, included a piano appearance by Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu.) Before the concert, Smith ran up and down the stairs of the building to see pop-up performances; in one room, where children were invited to take up instruments themselves, he tried to scratch out some notes on a quarter-size violin.
He posed with Nelsons, Wilkins and Keith Lockhart, the music director of the Boston Pops, along with leaders of local organizations, shouting, "1-2-3, say 'community!"' as their photo was snapped. During the main performance, he leaned against a wall and listened, as students from Boston Arts Academy's Tina Turner revue sang "Proud Mary" and the Boston Symphony played Samuel Coleridge-Taylor's Violin Concerto, with Nathan Amaral, a winner of the Sphinx Competition for young musicians of color.
The next day, Smith was on the road to Tanglewood. During the drive, he said that he hoped for the Boston Symphony to develop a reputation as New England's orchestra; he has ideas to add the region to its touring diet. But he also pointed out that the drive to Tanglewood from Boston was about the same as from New York, where a significant portion of the audience comes from every summer.
"We need to have a presence in both cities," he said. Recently, there have been Tanglewood billboards on the West Side Highway in Manhattan, with a photo of Nelsons and the phrase "Let summer sing."
At Tanglewood, Smith is planning to restore two historical buildings: Seranak, the home of the influential Boston Symphony music director Serge Koussevitzky; and the theater, where Britten's "Peter Grimes" had its American premiere in 1946. Both places have fallen into disrepair, but both have potential for the festival's future.
Seranak, Smith said, will be used for faculty and fellow housing. The theater, once renovated, will provide a proper stage for opera and ballet, whether for new works or visits from international companies. "I want Tanglewood," he said, "to be the classical music destination for the world."
The question, though, is when that will happen. Smith said that infrastructure follows mission, and that "the need to renovate the theater is not just about the stewardship of that building but a programmatic dead spot in our work." On a more practical level, he will work with the orchestra's board to order the list of changes that need to be made, in Boston and the Berkshires. The Humanities Institute will start this fall, but reaching a consensus on other projects, he said, will take about a year.
"Internally, change is hard," Smith said. "But change happens by making change. It's going to take investment, and a lot of listening and experimenting. But now is when we have to take the big swings."

Trump Film Is Closer To a Release: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "The Apprentice," a dramatized origin story about Donald J. Trump, has faced fierce criticism from the former president and his allies.
Hollywood executives love to characterize themselves as fearless. The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.
It's why theaters are clogged with vacuous sequels. It's why so many Hollywood power players hide behind P.R. people. And it's why all of the big movie studios and streaming services -- and, in fact, most indie film companies -- declined to distribute "The Apprentice," a dramatized origin story about Donald J. Trump that the former president has called "malicious defamation" and showered with cease-and-desist letters.
But the movie business still has at least one wildcatter: Tom Ortenberg.
Mr. Ortenberg, 63, and his Briarcliff Entertainment are pushing to complete a deal to acquire "The Apprentice" for wide release in theaters in the United States in September or early October -- close enough to the presidential election to bask in its heat, but far enough away to avoid final-stretch media overload. Briarcliff's pursuit of the $ 16 million film was confirmed by five people involved with the sale process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private negotiation.
"Tom's got more courage than most people in Hollywood combined," said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University's film school. "His interest in this kind of movie involves business, of course. He sees money to be made by leveraging millions of dollars in free publicity. But part of it is wanting to do his bit. He's liberal and cares about social issues."
Hurdles remain, the people cautioned. "Apprentice" producers cobbled together the money to make the movie from various sources. One was Kinematics, an upstart film company backed by Dan Snyder, the former Washington Commanders owner -- and a Trump supporter. Kinematics, which invested about $ 5 million, would need to sign off on the Briarcliff deal and has balked, calling the offer subpar, according to the five people involved in the sale process. The Kinematics snag was reported earlier by a Puck newsletter.
So producers have put together a package to buy out Kinematics at a premium. The sides are now haggling over terms, including the timing of payment.
Briarcliff will need to move quickly to engineer a fall release: Marketing materials must be prepared; theaters must be booked (and some might refuse). "The Apprentice" has reached distribution deals for Canada, Europe and parts of Asia. Once theaters overseas begin playing the film (sometime this fall), it will become available on global pirating sites, reducing its value to a U.S. distributor.
Mr. Ortenberg declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the film and its lead producers also declined to comment, as did Kinematics.
Over his four-decade movie career, Mr. Ortenberg has repeatedly championed movies deemed too hot to handle by the Hollywood establishment. Not all of his bets have paid off. But some have -- spectacularly.
In 2004, after Disney refused to release "Fahrenheit 9/11," Michael Moore's flame-throwing documentary about the George W. Bush administration and the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, it was Mr. Ortenberg, then president of a fledgling Lionsgate, who picked up the film. When theaters in conservative pockets of the country refused to play it, Mr. Ortenberg went on the attack.
"What these chains are doing is a horrible precedent for the movie business, and it shows exactly how fragile the First Amendment is," Mr. Ortenberg told The New York Times at the time. "Fahrenheit 9/11," which counted Harvey Weinstein as a producer, collected $ 222 million in global ticket sales, or about $ 368 million in today's dollars, the most ever for a documentary. The documentary cost less than $ 10 million to make.
Mr. Ortenberg's résumé also includes Kevin Smith's "Dogma," a profane 1999 religious satire that was greeted by protests, boycotts and death threats, and Oliver Stone's "W," a comedic 2008 skewering of Mr. Bush. Mr. Ortenberg was also behind "Spotlight," the Oscar-winning newspaper drama from 2015 about the Roman Catholic Church's cover-up of sexual abuse by priests.
In 2020, Briarcliff distributed "The Dissident," about the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and attempted cover-up by the Saudi government. In that case, too, Mr. Ortenberg stepped in after Hollywood companies balked at distributing it. "The Dissident" was a flop in limited theatrical release, but found a modest audience on home video.
"The Apprentice" debuted to mostly favorable reviews at the Cannes Film Festival last month and dramatizes Mr. Trump's origin story, focusing on his rise in New York real estate in the 1970s and '80s and mentorship by Roy Cohn, the unscrupulous power broker. Sebastian Stan, known for his role as Bucky Barnes in Marvel superhero movies, plays Mr. Trump. Jeremy Strong portrays the pugnacious Cohn, complete with burnt-bacon tan. Mr. Strong, an Emmy winner for HBO's "Succession," recently won a Tony Award for his performance in "An Enemy of the People" on Broadway.
Briarcliff plans to position both actors as Oscar contenders, according to the people involved with the sale.
"The Apprentice" also stars Maria Bakalova ("Borat Subsequent Moviefilm") as Ivana Trump. One incendiary scene shows Mr. Trump throwing her to the ground and assaulting her. In real life, she accused him of rape in a deposition related to their 1991 divorce. She later disavowed the claim, saying she did not mean rape in the "criminal sense." She died in 2022.
Kinematics, citing potential legal liability, pushed the film's director, Ali Abbasi, to remove or trim down the already brief scene before the Cannes premiere; Mr. Abbasi refused. Other scenes in the film depict Mr. Trump as hooked on speedlike diet pills and having fat surgically suctioned.
Last month, Mr. Trump threatened to sue to block the film's release. "This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have long been debunked," Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told reporters at the time.
A lawsuit from Mr. Trump would cause headaches for Briarcliff and the producers, but courts -- citing First Amendment protections -- have consistently sided with filmmakers in similar cases over the years.
The lead producers of "The Apprentice" are Amy Baer, the founding chief executive of CBS Films and a former Sony Pictures executive, and Daniel Bekerman, a scrappy indie producer with credits like "The Witch" (2015). "The Apprentice" was written by Gabriel Sherman, who is known for "The Loudest Voice in the Room," a best-selling 2014 biography of Roger Ailes, the disgraced political operative and Fox News leader.
Companies that passed on "The Apprentice" declined to comment or did not respond to queries. They included Focus Features, Sony, Searchlight, Netflix, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Amazon's Prime Video and A24.
In conversations with sales agents for the film, the uninterested companies justified their stance with various explanations, according to the people involved with distribution negotiations for the movie. A couple of potential distributors thought the film was good but not good enough to risk the almost guaranteed blowback -- not just from Mr. Trump's lawyers but from the broader MAGA world.
Other potential distributors worried about regulatory retribution from Mr. Trump should he be re-elected. During his first term, Mr. Trump's Justice Department tried to block AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, which owned CNN. The move was widely seen as retaliation for CNN coverage that angered Mr. Trump.
The box office prospects for "The Apprentice" are unclear. Sequels have been succeeding, but original movies -- dramas especially -- have been struggling to break through. Politically minded films have largely moved to streaming. "The Apprentice" could also fall in a chasm, with Trump supporters boycotting and liberal audiences repulsed.
"I have a hard time seeing any red-collared American going to see it," said Mr. Galloway of Chapman University. "Will others want to pay 20 bucks to consume even more Trump? Maybe. Maybe not."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sean Penn and Dakota Johnson outclass a humdrum script as two people who talk -- and talk -- in a New York City taxicab.
Handicapped by more than a terrible title, Christy Hall's "Daddio," set almost entirely inside a New York City taxicab, tries too hard and lasts too long. A synthetic encounter between a gabby cabby and his self-possessed female passenger, the movie is a claustrophobic two-hander oxygenated in part by Phedon Papamichael's sleekly gorgeous cinematography.
The star power of its leads, Sean Penn and Dakota Johnson, doesn't hurt either. Injecting nuance and emotional depth into Hall's uninspired script, the two turn a threatened slog into a mildly enjoyable journey. Penn plays Clark, a tough, salt-of-the-earth type (he actually talks about salt at one point) whose roughened hands and veined forearms are catnip to the camera. Johnson is his last fare of the night, a sophisticated young woman traveling from Kennedy Airport to midtown Manhattan. He calls her Girlie.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
He is very nosy. When not railing against credit cards and rideshare apps, he peppers his passenger with increasingly personal questions. Initially guarded, Girlie slowly warms to this drive-by philosopher. Through the barriers of age, gender, class and education, their revelations grow more intimate -- sometimes implausibly so, as when Clark shares a distasteful anecdote about his first wife, along with his thoughts on what married men want in a mistress. (Hint: It's not love.) Not that Girlie is clutching her pearls; rather, she's surreptitiously sexting her tongue-lolling lover.
Somehow, Penn never allows Clark's inappropriateness to become predatory, and Johnson's marvelously expressive features reveal details the dialogue declines to provide. Yet if there's a finer point to any of this -- beyond yes, talking to strangers is sometimes beneficial -- it eluded me. I did, though, appreciate Hall's choice to flash some texts directly onto the movie screen: Squinting at characters' smartphones is one of my least favorite activities. Along with listening to gossipy cabdrivers.

Record Labels Sue Two A.I. Music Generators: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The lawsuits say that Udio and Suno trained their products on reams of copyrighted music.
Major record companies, including the Sony, Universal and Warner conglomerates, sued two digital music generation companies on Monday, accusing them of using copyrighted sounds and songs to train the artificial intelligence that powers their businesses.
The two companies being sued, Udio and Suno, allow users to create songs almost instantly by submitting a text command, much like how A.I. services such as Midjourney produce images based on text prompts.
The power of artificial intelligence is upending numerous industries, and companies that are able to take advantage of the technology can financially benefit. But the music industry plaintiffs argued in their lawsuits that the songs produced by these A.I. companies were possible only because the systems were trained on reams of intellectual property that the plaintiffs own.
"The foundation of its business has been to exploit copyrighted sound recordings without permission," said the lawsuits filed against Udio and Suno in federal court.
"Building and operating a service like Udio's requires at the outset copying and ingesting massive amounts of data to 'train' a software 'model' to generate outputs," one suit said. "For Udio specifically, this process involved copying decades worth of the world's most popular sound recordings."
The suits are asking the courts to declare that the companies have engaged in copyright infringement and to assign damages.
"These are straightforward cases of copyright infringement involving unlicensed copying of sound recordings on a massive scale," Ken Doroshow, the chief legal officer of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade organization, said in a statement.
Doroshow added, "These lawsuits are necessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical and lawful development of generative A.I. systems."
In a statement on its website, Udio denied that its software training methods were untoward.
"Just as students listen to music and study scores, our model has 'listened' to and learned from a large collection of recorded music," it said. "The goal of model training is to develop an understanding of musical ideas -- the basic building blocks of musical expression that are owned by no one. Our system is explicitly designed to create music reflecting new musical ideas."
In an emailed statement, Suno's chief executive, Mikey Shulman, defended his company.
"Our technology is transformative; it is designed to generate completely new outputs, not to memorize and regurgitate pre-existing content," Shulman said, adding that users cannot refer to specific artists when asking Suno's software to create something.
"Suno is built for new music, new uses and new musicians," Shulman said. "We prize originality."
The new lawsuits echo earlier ones from creative industries that accuse A.I. companies of training their lucrative systems with material that belongs to someone else.
The New York Times sued Microsoft and OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, saying that millions of the newspaper's articles were used to train A.I. platforms. The photography syndicate Getty Images used similar reasoning in a lawsuit against Stability AI.
The actress and comedian Sarah Silverman and a group of novelists, including Jonathan Franzen and John Grisham, have filed separate lawsuits against OpenAI, accusing the company of training its systems with their work.

What Lies Ahead In the Battle For Subscribers: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: When the media titans Brian Roberts, John Malone and Barry Diller cast off in early February on Mr. Diller's 156-foot, two-masted yacht, named Arriva, the waters off the coast of Jupiter, Fla., were placid.
The same could not be said for their sprawling entertainment businesses.
The three men meet occasionally to discuss the state of the industry, and lively disagreements have a been a staple of their discussions. But by the time they met on the yacht, they had all agreed that the money-losing status quo in the streaming business was unsustainable. The old cable model was a melting ice cube.
But what will take its place?
"There was peace in the valley for a period of time," Mr. Malone mused in a rare recent interview, recalling the days before video-streaming upended the lucrative cable business. "Now, it's quite chaotic."
That is likely an understatement: The once-mighty Paramount, which owns the famed Paramount studio, CBS and a bevy of cable channels, recently replaced its chief executive and failed to sell itself after months of negotiations. Warner Bros. Discovery is frantically paying down its $ 43 billion in debt. Disney laid off thousands of workers and pushed out its chief executive as streaming losses mounted, and had to fend off a proxy contest from the activist investor Nelson Peltz.
The stocks of legacy media companies are a fraction of their former highs: Paramount is near $ 10 a share and Warner Bros. Discovery is hovering around $ 7, both down drastically from levels reached during the past year. Even Disney, at about $ 102, is down more than 16 percent from the price reached in March.
No wonder: Paramount, the media empire controlled by Shari Redstone, lost $ 1.6 billion on streaming last year. Comcast lost $ 2.7 billion on its Peacock streaming service. Disney lost about $ 2.6 billion on its services, which include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Warner Bros. Discovery says its Max streaming service eked out a profit last year, but only by including HBO sales through cable distributors.
At the same time, shares of the disrupters -- Netflix and Amazon -- are close to record highs.
Mr. Malone, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Diller all came of age during the golden era of television. Mr. Malone, 83, clawed his way to a multibillion dollar fortune by building a cable empire, and is an influential shareholder in Warner Bros. Discovery and a longtime mentor to its chief executive, David Zaslav. Mr. Roberts, 64, succeeded his father as chairman, chief executive and the most influential shareholder of Comcast. Since then, he has transformed Comcast into a broadband giant and, by acquiring NBCUniversal, into a media powerhouse. Mr. Diller, 82, is chairman of IAC, the digital media company, and a veteran TV and movie executive. His long and successful tenure in entertainment and media has earned him a position as one of the industry's most sought-after senior statesman.
By comparison, the heads of the disrupters, Netflix and Amazon, are younger, brash newcomers, with little attachment to Hollywood's golden age.
Ted Sarandos, 59, co-chief executive of Netflix, worked his way up through the now-defunct DVD industry before going straight to Netflix when the company was still renting DVDs by mail. Mike Hopkins, 55, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, was steeped in digital as chief executive of Hulu, the pioneering streaming service owned by Disney, Fox and NBCU, before joining Sony as head of its television unit in 2017. He came to Amazon in 2020 and reports to the company's chief executive, Andy Jassy, 56, who has no professional background in entertainment.
Over the past five months, The New York Times interviewed those three older executives, and the two younger ones, as well as numerous other owners and senior executives of major media companies to assess the problems facing the industry and what the future landscape could look like.
Rarely do these executives speak so candidly, on the record, about the challenge in front of them. And the meetings on the yacht aside, rarely do executives in that stratosphere get together to discuss strategy. Not only are many of them fierce rivals -- Mr. Roberts famously drove up the cost of Disney's 2019 acquisition of 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets by bidding against Disney's chief executive, Bob Iger -- but meetings among direct competitors might attract unwelcome attention from antitrust regulators.
In our conversations, there were still plenty of disagreements, but some consistent themes emerged as well -- all with major implications for investors, advertisers and audiences.
The Magic Subscriber Number
Streaming has long been hailed as a promising business, because companies like Netflix can add additional subscribers at little extra cost. The more paying subscribers a service has, the more the company's costs can be spread out over a large base, lowering the cost per subscriber.
But those subscribers want lots of options, and the costs of making enough programming can be enormous. As a result, a streaming service's profitability depends in large part on how many paying subscribers are needed before those TV shows and movies become cost-effective.
There was a time when industry executives hoped that number might be as low as 100 million.
But now the consensus among many of the executives interviewed is that the number is at least 200 million, and possibly more.
"If you're going to be a full entertainment service with live sports and tent-pole blockbusters today, 200 million is a number that can give you the scale with the hope for growth over time," Mr. Hopkins of Amazon said.
Bob Chapek, Disney's chief executive until 2022, also agreed that 200 million was the number that meant "you're big enough to compete."
Netflix has reached that, and then some, with about 270 million paying subscribers. Moreover, those subscribers pay an industry-leading average of more than $ 11 per month.
Netflix is highly profitable, with operating margins of 28 percent. In the first quarter of 2024, Netflix reported revenue of $ 9.4 billion, and $ 2.3 billion in net income. No one else comes close.
Disney and Amazon are the only other streaming services with more than 200 million subscribers. While Amazon doesn't disclose the number of its Prime Video subscribers, Mr. Hopkins said the number was well above 200 million and growing. Disney+ and Hulu, which is also owned by Disney, have just over 200 million subscribers combined.
In May, Disney said its entertainment streaming services eked out a small profit. Amazon doesn't disclose profit margins or losses, and streaming is embedded in a package of Prime services. But Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, has said that Prime Video will be "a large and profitable business" on its own.
$ 50 Million an Episode, Over and Over
The costs of attracting -- and keeping -- those millions of customers is no cheap feat.
Overall, Netflix has said it will spend about $ 17 billion this year on programming, about what it did before last year's Hollywood strikes depressed production. That level of spending has produced a golden age for A-list writers and actors, many of whom are flocking to the company. A new series, "3 Body Problem," debuted a few months ago on Netflix at a reported cost of about $ 20 million per episode. It spent more than $ 200 million on "The Gray Man," starring Ryan Gosling.
"It's a tall order to entertain the world," Mr. Sarandos of Netflix said. "You have to do it with regularity and dependably."
For Netflix, $ 17 billion represents only about half of its total revenue. But almost no competitor can match that spending level, the executives said, except for maybe Amazon. Amazon spent $ 300 million for six episodes of the spy thriller "Citadel," or $ 50 million per episode -- one of several major bets it has made.
Not all of those pay off. But when they do, the impact can be huge, like wildcatters when they hit a gusher. Amazon paid $ 153 million for one season of "Fallout," a series based on the popular post apocalyptic video game. In April, "Fallout" was the top streaming title, racking up over seven billion viewing minutes, according to Amazon.
Mr. Sarandos held out the company's recent "Baby Reindeer" series as a prime example of why companies have to keep spending: because viewers expect a nearly endless supply of options, or they will hit the unsubscribe button.
"When you finish 'Baby Reindeer,' there's something else just as good," he said. "I worry that this notion of these other services, that they have nothing to watch problem, and that once you do a show and then you drag it out over 10 weeks or doing one episode at a time, you still end up in the same place, which is there's nothing to watch after it."
The data appear to bear him out. When cable TV was in its heyday, 1.5 to 2 percent of subscribers churned monthly, abandoning or suspending their service. The average churn across all streaming services is more than double that, according to data from analytics firm Antenna, with the churn rate of some smaller streaming services, like Paramount+, as high as 7 percent. Only Netflix has a churn rate below 4 percent.
Some executives who oversee rivals to Netflix and Amazon say their companies can reduce spending by only producing hits. But that's been the holy grail ever since Hollywood was created, and no one has succeeded over the long term. Even Disney's Marvel franchise has stumbled at the box office lately.
That means streaming services need the resources to invest in a wide variety of projects, knowing there will be some, even many, relative failures for every hit. ("Citadel" is a case in point -- it never made Nielsen's top 10 streaming shows.)
"It's still more art than science," Mr. Sarandos said.
Play Ball
Adding to the cost pressure, the executives said, is the soaring cost of sports programming. Even in the bygone era of traditional television, the broad appeal of sports was obvious. The big networks paid billions for must-see events like the Super Bowl and the N.B.A. Finals and much of what was left over went to Disney and Hearst-owned ESPN, one of the most lucrative cable franchises ever created.
But that was before streaming and the arrival of the deep-pocketed tech giants. Amazon now offers football games from the National Football League, NASCAR races, the W.N.B.A. with its newly minted star Caitlin Clark, the National Hockey League in Canada and Champions League soccer in Germany, Italy and Britain.
Apple TV+ also features Major League Baseball, as well as Major League Soccer.
Alphabet's YouTube offers N.F.L. Sunday Ticket, a lineup of out-of-market football games. Even Netflix, which long shunned live sports, announced in May that it would stream N.F.L. games on Christmas Day for the next three years.
The appeal of live sports is both unique and twofold: They attract new streaming subscribers and reduce churn since viewers want to watch sports live. It is also a big draw for advertisers as streaming services look to grow their ad businesses.
It may not be an overstatement, the executives said, to say that a streaming service can't survive as a stand-alone business without sports.
Comcast's Peacock scored a huge success in January with its exclusive N.F.L. playoff game between Kansas City and Miami. The game was the biggest livestreaming event ever, with about 32 million viewers. (Comcast's NBC network pays $ 2 billion annually for a package of N.F.L. broadcast rights.)
"Sports seems like the simplest and most interesting thing," Mr. Malone said.
The result is bidding wars unlike anything experienced before in the media industry, currently on display during the protracted negotiations for a new 10-year N.B.A. rights contract. The rights, which are now shared by ESPN and Warner Bros. Discovery's Turner cable network, are being chased by NBC and Amazon, as well as ESPN and Warner Bros. Discovery.
While ESPN, Amazon and NBC are finalizing deals for their packages, Warner Bros. Discovery is seen at risk of being outbid, though executives at Warner Bros. believe they have the legal rights to match Amazon's bid. Many in the industry expect that the final deal will be more than triple the last N.B.A. contract.Which raises questions that executives didn't have a clear answers to:
As the cost of rights soars, will the streaming services actually make money on them? Or will marquee sports events function as loss leaders, drawing viewers to other fare, as they once did for the old broadcast networks?
Advertising to the Rescue?
Wall Street analysts and investors in streaming once fixated entirely on the number of subscribers, ignoring losses, in the belief that prices would someday rise substantially. That changed with dizzying speed in early 2022, when Netflix announced it had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade.
It's now clear that price increases won't be the answer to streaming profitability for most services, the executives said. Netflix is the industry price leader and has pushed its monthly fee in the United States to $ 15.49 a month without ads. Few believe the monthly fee can get much above $ 20 a month for the foreseeable future.
After years of championing an ad-free consumer experience, Netflix introduced an ad-supported subscription in 2022 at a steep discount of $ 6.99 a month. Disney+, Hulu, Amazon, Warner Bros. Discovery's Max, Peacock and Paramount+ all offer cheaper, ad-supported subscriptions.
"It's a nice way to get price-sensitive consumers," said Mr. Chapek, who introduced an ad-supported tier while running Disney. "Heavy users will still come and pay the higher monthly fee."
Mr. Chapek acknowledged that advertisers covet -- and will pay more for -- mass audiences. As a result, the streaming services have a strong incentive to produce programs with broad appeal instead of more niche content, including some of the kind that generates critical acclaim.
Netflix shocked many in the industry last year when for the first time it revealed its most-watched programs over the prior six months. At the top were "The Night Agent," an action-thriller, and "Ginny and Georgia," a comedy-drama about a mother and daughter trying to forge a new life. Both shows were snubbed by Emmy voters, with a lone nomination for a song from "Ginny and Georgia." ("Squid Game," developed in Korea, is Netflix's most-watched program ever.)
Advertisers, the executives say, also like that streaming services can target ads to specific users and demographics.
The results have been explosive. Netflix is on pace to generate roughly $ 1 billion in advertising revenue this year, according to estimates from eMarketer, and Disney has already generated $ 1.7 billion this fiscal year.
That kind of success suggests that streaming ads are here to stay. And some of the executives said streaming services predicted that companies would raise prices aggressively on ad-free tiers in an effort to drive consumers to ad-supported versions.
Who Will Survive?
How many streaming services will consumers support? That was one of the great mysteries of the nascent streaming world, and the answer is coming into focus: not very many.
"Can your current business be a successful player and have long-term wealth generation, or are you going to be roadkill?" Mr. Malone mused. "I think all the small players will have to shrink down or go away."
A recent Deloitte study found that American households paid an average of $ 61 a month for four streaming services, but that many didn't think the expense was worth it.
That suggests the once-unthinkable possibility, many of the executives said, that there will be only three or four streaming survivors: Netflix and Amazon, almost certainly. Probably some combination of Disney and Hulu. Apple remains a niche participant, but appears to be feeling its way into a long-term, albeit money-losing, presence, which it can afford to do. That leaves big question marks over Peacock, Warner Bros. Discovery's Max, and Paramount+.
Peacock, with just 34 million subscribers, isn't trying to be another Netflix. By focusing on North America, and not trying to be all things to all customers, Mr. Roberts believes Peacock can achieve success on its own terms.
Peacock also has the advantage to being embedded in the much larger Comcast, with its steady cash flow.
"We all have a different calculus to define success in streaming," Mr. Roberts said. "As online viewing increases and internet usage skyrockets, I believe we have a special set of assets that put us in position to continue to monetize and more importantly innovate as this transition happens."
The Bundling Conundrum
After years of go-it-alone strategies, "bundling" -- offering consumers a package of streaming services for a single fee -- has become the latest strategy for reaching profitability among the smaller services.
In May, Comcast announced it would offer its broadband customers a bundle of Peacock, Netflix and Apple TV+ for $ 15 a month. Disney has bundled Disney+ and Hulu, with Max to be added this summer at an as-yet undisclosed price. Venu, a new sports streaming joint venture from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery, is planning its release this fall.
However innovative the arrangements, the executives said, the economics of bundling are complicated. Participants need to attract consumers who wouldn't already subscribe to their individual channels at full price. They must also puzzle through how revenue should be divided among bundling participants of unequal stature.
It's also unclear that bundling will achieve the scale that participants may be hoping for. Many customers already subscribe to one or more of the bundle options. So it's not a matter of simply adding up subscribers. And if multiple subscriptions are offered at a discount to attract customers, the average revenue per user declines.
Jason Kilar, the founding Hulu chief executive and former chief executive of WarnerMedia, has called for an even more radical approach than bundling: a new company that would license movies and TV shows from the major studios and pay back close to 70 percent of the revenue to those studios.
"I'll call it the 'Spotify for Hollywood' path, where a large number of suppliers and studios contribute to a singular experience that delights fans," Mr. Kilar said. "The studios would be the ones that would be taking the majority of the economic returns from such a structure."
Media companies have started to embrace licensing deals after a period of avoiding them. During AT&T's ill-fated ownership of WarnerMedia, the company insisted that its content be shown exclusively on its Max streaming service. Disney pulled back on licensing deals when it started Disney+ in an effort to force fans to subscribe. Before he returned to Disney, in 2022, Mr. Iger compared licensing the company's franchises to selling nuclear weapons to "third-world countries."
But AT&T subsequently abandoned streaming, merging WarnerMedia into Discovery, and Mr. Iger has since embraced the nuclear option. Both Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are again licensing their content to rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime.
Sony Goes Another Way
One company embodies the embrace of the licensing strategy: Sony Pictures Entertainment.
Sony, the studio behind "Spider Man" and "Men in Black," rejected general entertainment streaming services years ago. Tony Vinciquerra, the company's chief executive, instead adopted what he has called an "arms dealer" strategy, selling movies and TV shows to companies like Disney and Netflix.
The exception is that Sony operates a niche streamer, Crunchyroll, that focuses on anime, Japanese-style hand-dawn animation. Its success suggests that a small (more than 14 million subscribers worldwide) and low-cost operation can be profitable without going up against Netflix.
Mr. Vinciquerra pointed out that Sony's rivals running big streaming businesses were losing money on those services while at the same time seeing their traditional cable networks in decline.
"I'm still scratching my head wondering what these companies will do here," Mr. Vinciquerra said, referring to the declining cable networks. "They all have these massive albatrosses around their neck that they can't do anything about right now."
So far, Sony's strategy appears to be working. Sony's Pictures Entertainment generated almost $ 11 billion of revenue in 2023, a 2 percent increase from the same period a year earlier, according to filings. In 2021, Sony struck deals to license movies to both Netflix and Disney worth an estimated $ 3 billion annually. Profits were roughly $ 1.2 billion, 10 percent lower than the previous year because of the actors' and writers' strikes.
Unlike Paramount or Disney, Sony Pictures is part of a sprawling global consumer electronics conglomerate. Sony recently teamed up with the private-equity giant Apollo Global Management to make a $ 26 billion bid for Paramount. But Sony is interested only in Paramount's film library and characters like SpongeBob SquarePants and has contemplated selling the rest of it -- including the Paramount+ streaming service. But Sony has since backed away from its offer.
That's just the latest indication that expectations for merger deals have faded. Paramount is still looking for a buyer after months of tortured negotiations and is revamping its streaming strategy in the meantime. So far as is known, no one is pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery, free since April, to buy or be sold under the terms of its separation from AT&T. Potential buyers like Comcast are understandably wary of their decaying revenue bases in cable. And Disney is shackled with its own cable issues and is loaded with debt from buying 21st Century Fox.
The End of a Golden Age
All of these changes have had a big upside for viewers.
"It's been a golden age, even with prices rising," Mr. Chapek said. "You get entire libraries built over decades plus all this new content, and you watch at your leisure."
But a change is underway, he said: "Now we just have to make it viable for shareholders."
That will necessarily mean higher prices for customers, more advertising, and less -- and less expensive -- content. That's already happening. On average, consumers spend 41 percent more on streaming than they did a year ago, according to the recent Deloitte study, while satisfaction has declined. While some of that may be because of the limited new content offered last year during the Hollywood strikes, Disney and pretty much everyone except Netflix and Amazon have vowed to reduce spending and produce less new content.
The rise of advertising may be a windfall for streaming services, but the quest for the mass audiences that advertisers seek risks turning the streaming landscape into a sea of police procedurals and hospital dramas punctuated by major sports events and blockbuster concerts. Ironically, that's pretty much the old model once dominated by the four ad-supported broadcast networks.
Netflix and Amazon executives acknowledge the risks to high-quality programming but promise that won't happen on their watch. They contend they have enough scale that their prestige programs can be profitable and reach a vast audience -- even if it's a small percentage of their overall subscriber base.
"We can do prestige TV at scale," Mr. Sarandos said. "But we don't only do prestige," he added, citing popular shows like "Night Agent."
Mr. Hopkins of Amazon said "procedurals and other tried and true formats do well for us, but we also need big swings that have customers saying 'Wow, I can't believe that just happened' and will have people telling their friends."
"We want rabid fans," he said.
Bryan Lourd, chief executive and co-chairman of the powerful Creative Artists Agency, said media executives needed to put aside financial engineering and remember that creativity -- and entertaining customers -- was the only way to win in the long run.
"The task at hand is to keep the customer at the front of your brain," Mr. Lourd said. "When people stop doing that is when things start to go wrong."
And Yet, Continued Optimism
On Mr. Diller's yacht that day in February, Mr. Malone's advice to Mr. Roberts was simple: In light of the challenges facing the industry, Comcast should continue its current strategy of investing in other areas like theme parks.
"Now, are they large enough to be the biggest?" said Mr. Diller, speaking generally about streaming services besides Netflix. "No, that game was lost some years ago. Netflix commands not all the territory, but they command the leading territory right now. They essentially are in a position of dictating policy."
But Mr. Diller, like many of the other executives interviewed for this article, see a path forward for streaming companies once they stop trying to be Netflix. (That's the strategy already adopted by Mr. Roberts of Comcast.)
The focus, according to Mr. Diller, needs to be on what "has been true since the beginning of time."
The business, he said, "is based on hit programming, making a program, a movie, a something that people want to see."

When media titans Brian Roberts, John Malone and Barry Diller cast off in early February on Diller’s yacht, the waters off the coast of Jupiter, Florida, were placid. The same could not be said for their sprawling entertainment businesses.
The three men meet occasionally to discuss the state of the industry. By the time they met on the yacht, they had all agreed that the money-losing status quo in the streaming business was unsustainable.
But what will take its place?
“There was peace in the valley for a period of time,” Malone mused in a rare recent interview, recalling the days before video-streaming upended the lucrative cable business. “Now, it’s quite chaotic.”
That is likely an understatement: The once-mighty Paramount, which owns CBS and a bevy of cable channels, recently replaced its CEO and failed to sell itself after months of negotiations. Warner Bros. Discovery is frantically paying down its $43 billion in debt. Disney laid off thousands of workers and pushed out its CEO as streaming losses mounted.
Paramount lost $1.6 billion on streaming last year. Comcast lost $2.7 billion on its Peacock streaming service. Disney lost about $2.6 billion on its services, which include Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. Warner Bros. Discovery says its Max streaming service eked out a profit last year, but only by including HBO sales through cable distributors.
The stocks of legacy media companies are a fraction of their former highs. At the same time, shares of the disrupters — Netflix and Amazon — are close to record highs.
Malone, Roberts and Diller all came of age during the golden era of television. Malone, 83, acquired his fortune by building a cable empire and is an influential shareholder in Warner Bros. Discovery. Roberts, 64, succeeded his father as chair, CEO and the most influential shareholder of Comcast. Since then, by acquiring NBCUniversal, he has transformed Comcast into a media powerhouse. Diller, 82, is chair of IAC, the digital media company, and a veteran TV and movie executive.
By comparison, the heads of Netflix and Amazon are brash newcomers, with little attachment to Hollywood’s golden age.
Ted Sarandos, 59, co-CEO of Netflix, worked his way up through the DVD industry, now defunct. Mike Hopkins, 55, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, was steeped in digital as CEO of Hulu, the pioneering streaming service now owned by Disney, before joining Sony in 2017. He came to Amazon in 2020 and reports to the company’s CEO, Andy Jassy, 56.
The New York Times interviewed those three older executives, and the two younger ones, as well as numerous other owners and senior executives of major media companies to assess the problems facing the industry.
Rarely do these executives speak so candidly, on the record, about the challenge in front of them. In our conversations, some consistent themes emerged — all with major implications for investors, advertisers and audiences.
The Magic Subscriber Number
Streaming has long been hailed as a promising business, because companies like Netflix can add subscribers at little extra cost. The more paying subscribers a service has, the more the company’s costs can be spread over a large base, lowering the cost per subscriber.
But those subscribers want lots of options, and the costs of making enough programming can be enormous. As a result, a streaming service’s profitability depends in large part on how many paying subscribers are needed before those TV shows and movies become cost-effective.
There was a time when industry executives hoped that number might be as low as 100 million. But now the consensus among many of the executives interviewed is that the number is at least 200 million, and possibly more.
“If you’re going to be a full entertainment service with live sports and tent-pole blockbusters today, 200 million is a number that can give you the scale with the hope for growth over time,” Hopkins of Amazon said.
Bob Chapek, Disney’s CEO until 2022, also agreed that 200 million was the number that meant “you’re big enough to compete.”
Netflix has reached that, and then some, with over 270 million paying subscribers. Moreover, those subscribers pay an industry-leading average of more than $11 per month.
Netflix is highly profitable, with operating margins of 28%. Disney and Amazon are the only other streaming services with more than 200 million subscribers. No one else comes close.
$50 Million an Episode
Attracting — and keeping — those millions of customers is no cheap feat.
Overall, Netflix has said it will spend about $17 billion this year on programming. That level of spending has produced a golden age for A-list writers and actors, many of whom are flocking to the company.
“It’s a tall order to entertain the world,” Sarandos of Netflix said. “You have to do it with regularity and dependably.”

It may not be an overstatement, the executives said, to say that a streaming service can’t survive as a stand-alone business without sports.
The result is bidding wars unlike anything experienced before in the media industry, currently on display during the protracted negotiations for a new 10-year NBA rights contract.
While ESPN, Amazon and NBC are finalizing deals for their packages, Warner Bros. Discovery’s Turner cable network is seen at risk of being outbid. Many in the industry expect that the final deal will be more than triple the last NBA contract.

Jason Kilar, the founding Hulu CEO and former CEO of WarnerMedia, has called for a more radical approach than bundling: a new company that would license movies and TV shows from the major studios.
“I’ll call it the ‘Spotify for Hollywood’ path, where a large number of suppliers and studios contribute to a singular experience,” Kilar said. “The studios would be the ones that would be taking the majority of the economic returns from such a structure.”
Media companies have started to embrace licensing deals after a period of avoiding them. During AT&T’s ill-fated ownership of WarnerMedia, the company insisted that its content be shown exclusively on Max. Disney pulled back on licensing deals when it started Disney+ in an effort to force fans to subscribe.
But AT&T then abandoned streaming, merging WarnerMedia into Discovery, and Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are again licensing their content to their rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime.
End of a Golden Age
All of these changes have had a big upside for viewers.
“It’s been a golden age, even with prices rising,” Chapek said. “You get entire libraries built over decades plus all this new content, and you watch at your leisure.”
But a change is underway, he said: “Now we just have to make it viable for shareholders.”
That will necessarily mean higher prices for customers, more advertising and less — and less expensive — content. That’s already happening.
The rise of advertising may be a windfall for streaming services, but the quest for the mass audiences that advertisers seek risks turning the streaming landscape into a sea of police procedurals and hospital dramas punctuated by major sports events and blockbuster concerts. Ironically, that’s pretty much the model once dominated by the ad-supported broadcast networks.
But Diller sees a path forward for streaming companies. The focus, according to Diller, needs to be on what “has been true since the beginning of time.”
The business, he said, “is based on hit programming — making a program, a movie, a something that people want to see.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Vladimir Putin promised unspecified technological help to North Korea, which could allow it to advance its nuclear weapons program.
As Vladimir V. Putin's Russia and Xi Jinping's China deepened their confrontation with the West over the past decade, they were always united with the United States on at least one geopolitical project: dismantling or at least containing North Korea's nuclear arsenal.
That is, until the war in Ukraine broke out two years ago.
In one of the starkest back-to-the-Cold War moments yet, Mr. Putin's visit Wednesday to Pyongyang -- and the announcement of a pact to provide "mutual assistance in the event of aggression" -- underscored that efforts by the world's three biggest nuclear powers to halt nuclear proliferation by North Korea had been dying for some time. Mr. Putin and Kim Jong-un, the North's leader, just presided over the memorial service.
Mr. Putin did far more than drop any semblance of a desire to ensure nuclear restraint. He promised unspecified technological help that -- if it includes the few critical technologies Mr. Kim has sought to perfect -- could help the North design a warhead that could survive re-entry into the atmosphere and threaten its many adversaries, starting with the United States.
Nowhere in the statements made Wednesday was there even a hint that North Korea should give up any of its estimated 50 or 60 nuclear weapons. To the contrary, Mr. Putin declared: "Pyongyang has the right to take reasonable measures to strengthen its own defense capability, ensure national security and protect sovereignty" -- though he did not address whether those measures included further developing the North's nuclear weapons.
While the shift has been clear-cut, what it could portend is stunning. "This is a renewal of Cold War-era security guarantees, no doubt," said Victor Cha, who worked on North Korea issues during the George W. Bush administration. Those guarantees date to a now-defunct 1961 mutual defense treaty between Pyongyang and Moscow.
This time, however, the agreement "is based on mutual transactional needs -- artillery for Russia and high-end military technology" for North Korea, said Mr. Cha, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They are united not by ideology, as in the Cold War, but in common opposition to the U.S. and the Western liberal order," he added.
As the threat from North Korea grows, Mr. Cha said, the new pact is almost certain to solidify an increasingly formal security alliance between Japan, South Korea and the United States.
The Russians signaled what was coming 18 months ago.
Desperate for more artillery to press the war effort in Ukraine, Mr. Putin turned to Mr. Kim for some modest help with ammunition in late 2022. That trickle has now reportedly turned into a flood: five million rounds of ammunition, by the estimates of Western intelligence services, and a growing array of North Korea-made munitions, jammed into what the State Department said were 11,000 shipping containers full of arms. Ballistic missiles followed.
It is a reflection of the fact that North Korea now has, for perhaps the first time in its history, a valuable bargaining chip that one of its allies in its standoff with the West needs: It is a prodigious arms producer.
At first, Mr. Kim was happy to receive oil and food in return. But in the intelligence assessments circulating in Washington and Europe, officials say, there is growing concern that the North Korean leader is now determined to surmount the last big technological hurdle in making his country a full-fledged nuclear weapons state -- the capability to reach any American city with his nuclear weapons.
Russia holds the keys; the question is whether it is willing to hand them over.
"Russia's need for support in the context of Ukraine has forced it to grant some long-sought concessions to China, North Korea and Iran," Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, told Congress in March, "with the potential to undermine, among other things, long-held nonproliferation norms."
In closed, classified sessions, she was far more specific, taking key members of Congress through the array of technologies Mr. Kim has not yet shown he can master. Most of them involve keeping a nuclear warhead aloft for 6,000 miles and making sure it can survive, and accurately hit its target, on re-entry to the atmosphere.
That is the step a series of American presidents have said they cannot live with. Before the conclusion of this week's meeting in Pyongyang, Mr. Cha wrote that the prospect of Russian help to the North "presents the greatest threat to U.S. national security since the Korean War."
"This relationship, deep in history and reinvigorated by the war in Ukraine, undermines the security of Europe, Asia and the U.S. homeland. Amid front-burner issues like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza," he contended, the "administration relegates this problem to the back burner at its own peril."
Of course, Washington has faced so many warnings about the dangers of North Korea's arsenal -- dating to its first nuclear test 18 years ago -- that it has become almost the background music of geopolitical upheaval.
Mr. Kim has also shown a willingness to strike the United States in non-nuclear ways. The North was responsible for a devastating hack of Sony Pictures a decade ago, which took out most of the studio's computing capability. The attack was prompted by Sony's decision to release "The Interview," a Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy about two journalists sent off to assassinate Mr. Kim.
In many ways, it set the stage for the modern cyber wars, and the North has financed the expansion of its nuclear program by hacking into central banks and other lucrative Western targets.
A seemingly endless series of United Nations financial sanctions has failed to cripple either the nuclear expansion or the North's closely related missile program. American efforts at sabotage have worked, but not for long.
So that leaves the United States dependent on the cold calculus of deterrence: reminding the North, with exercises of long-range bombers, that a strike on the United States or its allies would almost certainly result in the destruction of the country. But a credible security pact with Moscow would complicate that reasoning, with its suggestion that Russia could potentially strike back on the North's behalf. The terms of Wednesday's agreement, however, were not clearly spelled out.
Mr. Putin's announcements on Wednesday were also a reminder that North Korea's continued success in pursuing nuclear weapons marks one of Washington's greatest bipartisan failures. It began in the Clinton administration; faced with an emerging crisis with the North in 1994, the administration considered taking out its emerging nuclear program before it produced a single weapon.
President Bill Clinton pulled back, convinced that diplomacy was the better route -- the beginning of three decades of on-again, off-again negotiations. China and Russia helped, joining in the "Six Party Talks" with North Korea that sought to buy off its program.
When that collapsed, there were sanctions and a United Nations monitoring group that was supposed to publicly present evidence of sanctions evasion. When the monitoring operation came up for renewal at the United Nations recently, Russia successfully led the charge to get rid of it, at least for now.
Now there are two immediate challenges ahead for the United States, Japan, South Korea and other allies. The first is to attempt to stop the transfer of the technology Mr. Kim has on his shopping list. It includes, Mr. Cha and other experts say, the means to build quiet nuclear-armed submarines, and the technology to evade missile defenses.
In the past, Mr. Putin has provided missile designs to the North, American intelligence officials have reported, but there is little evidence that he has helped with actual nuclear weapons. Now the North has leverage: Keeping the artillery store open for Mr. Putin may hinge on Mr. Kim's getting what he wants.
And no one is watching this more closely than the Iranians. They, too, are supplying the Russians with drones. U.S. officials believe the two are discussing missiles. And just last week, the Iranians stepped up pressure on Israel and the United States, saying they were putting their most advanced centrifuges -- capable of quickly turning Iran's fuel stockpile into the material needed to make three nuclear weapons -- deep inside an underground facility that may be beyond Israel's ability to reach with bunker-busting bombs.
If North Korea's gambit works, the Iranians may also see a benefit in growing even closer with Russia. And Mr. Putin may conclude he has little to lose.

In an Ominous Realm, Faith Faces Many Tests: [Correction]

Full text: A new tier of knights, monsters and freaks often exceeds the most demanding late-game adversaries of Elden Ring. Belief in yourself will be stretched to its limit.
One of the first landmarks you'll come across in Shadow of the Erdtree is a tall, brilliantly shining cross. Intersected at its peak by a thin crescent -- most likely a representation of the Golden Order, the dark fantasy world's ruling theocracy -- it feels bluntly referential to saints and prophets and resurrections.
Shadow of the Erdtree, an expansion to the commercially successful, critically adored and deviously demanding action role-playing game Elden Ring, wants to know whose faith matters. And whether having the kind of blind faith required to follow a mysterious lord into unknown lands is a good thing after all.
Expansions to FromSoftware games tend to be steep-walled gantlets, meant to provide a heightened challenge for experienced players. Shadow of the Erdtree is no different. You will be tested. Your faith in your abilities, your belief in yourself, will be stretched to its limit.
You will need to trust, against facts and experiences, that you can take on tough enemies who would readily stomp you, that you can persevere against this new crop of knights, monsters and freaks, most of whom far exceed in rigor even the most demanding of Elden Ring's late-game enemies.
The big bag of tricks I had gathered in Elden Ring felt largely useless against this new tier of adversaries, who casually shrugged off my fully upgraded spear tips and carefully honed sword edges. Collecting Scadutree fragments, an expansion-specific resource, grants you a much-needed boost in power.
There is a tension at the heart of most FromSoftware games, ever since Demon's Souls. We are offered beautiful, awe-inspiring worlds, full of scenes of tenderness and melancholy. But these worlds also happen to be dreadful and largely inhospitable. We are trespassers in them and we must bite and claw our way to each breathtaking vista, to look out onto the misty valleys and craggy peaks ahead, doubtlessly full of terrifying nightmares all ready to tear us to bits.
As interlocutors to this grim spectacle, we must weigh our faith in ourselves -- in our desire to see things through to the end -- against the faith of a fresh cast of characters, all devoted to some extent to their newfound saint Miquella. Because of our past forays, these knights have long been vassals without lords.
In Christ-like fashion, Miquella has given up his own living form and ascended to a more heavenly position. The crosses throughout a bizarre realm wreathed in shadow mark sites where he has shed his corporeal flesh. But rather than commune with Marika, his deified mother, Miquella wants to escape the strictures and expectations of her Golden Order.
Shadow of the Erdtree inserts emotional nuance by implicating the player more forcefully than FromSoftware usually does. It doesn't feel that righteous, after all, to barrel into an undiscovered place and lay waste to its noble, magical creatures or even its largely sympathetic villains. It feels like even more of a disturbance to tear your way through this sad and beautiful shadowland, full of characters who have fled the ravaging oppression of the Golden Order in search of some safety and meaning.
And beautiful it certainly is. Though you start out on the relatively moribund Gravesite Plains, illuminated faintly by a sickly green-yellow light cast from the shadowy Scadutree looming in the dark sky, traveling in any direction quickly diversifies the aesthetic palette.
There's the satisfying meat and potatoes of exploration at Castle Ensis, with vertiginous balustrades and winding ramparts that cross over and under themselves in impossible architectural configurations. Further out, there's the gothic, imposing keep of the lord Messmer, who wages constant war against the residents of the Shadow Realm.
Beyond these series staples are far-flung and exotic locations rich with flavor. Coastal meadows are layered densely with bright and colorful flowers. To the east, towering and craggy peaks swarm with dragons and crack with lightning. Impossibly deep caves in somber velvets and blues are rimmed with massive coffin ships of unknown origin.
Shadow of the Erdtree naturally carries over many of the things that made Elden Ring such a hit: a profound sense of scale and depth; remarkable challenges that make exploration feel tense and exciting; and stunning visual arrangements of architecture and nature.
But this expansion also has something the original game lacked. While still very much an open world, with fields to gallop across and deep canyons and caves to plunge into, Shadow of the Erdtree bends toward the layer-cake-like level design of the original Dark Souls. Elden Ring's boundaries felt nearly endless, with each map segment revealing a huge undiscovered land mass. Shadow of the Erdtree covers a significant stretch of land but feels much tighter, more thoroughly honeycombed through.
What might seem like a regular hill, green with shrubbery, stones and moss, is quickly revealed to be the very top layer of a mazelike ruin dug deep into the earth. A bottomless and impassable canyon is rarely how it first appears.
The hunt for secrets can feel overwhelming. More than a few locations in the Shadow Realm, places that contain important story beats and powerful items, can be discovered only with a frustratingly obtuse progression of steps. One memorable area involves finding your way through previously flooded districts, past hidden doors and beyond unassuming statues. It can feel more like the spatial puzzle game Myst than a hack-and-slash adventure.
That being said, Shadow of the Erdtree is full of violent conflict. The boss fights are often magnificent and quite memorable, especially in their inevitable second stages. You'll be aided, more often than not, by one of the Miquella faithful, who often add a nice narrative layer to the battle by dropping angry lines before courageously rushing forward.
The prickly foes include the Dancing Lion, with strange human limbs poking out from beneath a flowing costume and a refreshing mix of tragedy and lighthearted comedy. High up in the jagged peak, Bayle is a nice evolution of Elden Ring's well-trodden dragon design. It takes on the mannerisms of a snarling bulldog and will quickly rush you with all the intensity of one. Along with a number of the other late-game bosses, Bayle can require a significant restructuring of strategy and gear.
This is where Shadow of the Erdtree hits a familiar bottleneck, narrowing into a grueling ordeal of bosses. The healing flasks and armor you once used to soak up blows begin falling short during this crescendo of difficulty. You'll need more than a hope or a prayer.
This is where my faith in my ability to make it to the end was tested. As an expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree wants to make things challenging enough for the fiercely dedicated fan base, the kinds of people who will spend hours analyzing perfect builds or figuring out how many frames of invincibility you get based on the weight of armor.
If you're the agnostic type, if you're just here to take in the sights, it will probably be a long time before you're ready to enter that final arena. Luckily there are plenty of other things to see first. New spirit springs are locked by hidden stone cairns, which I've wasted an embarrassing amount of time trying to root out.
Maybe you won't want to match your faith against Miquella's after all. Maybe you'll see the tests laid out ahead and think better of it. That's fine too. There is nothing wrong with leaving the faithful to their devotion while moving on to greener, less shadowed pastures.
Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, which releases on Friday, was reviewed on the PlayStation 5. It will also be available on the PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

If North Korea’s gambit works, the Iranians may also see a benefit in growing even closer with Russia. And Putin may conclude he has little to lose.

Masochists Gearing Up For Elden Ring's Latest: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Influencers who have guided players through an unforgiving world are powering anticipation for the video game's next chapter, Shadow of the Erdtree.
Kai Cenat had died more than 430 times and was prepared to die again when one of the toughest adversaries in video game history, Malenia, Goddess of Rot, finally succumbed to his sword after a marathon battle in Elden Ring.
"I don't think you understand what this means," Cenat told his livestream after the 24-hour fight last month, which included a portion of his 10.8 million Twitch followers. One of the most popular gamers on the internet was panting. He had lost his breath playing a two-year-old game that sprouted a cottage industry of influencers capitalizing on its notorious difficulty.
Elden Ring became a phenomenon after it was released in February 2022. It was a breakout hit for the president of FromSoftware, Hidetaka Miyazaki, who enlisted the "Game of Thrones" author George R. R. Martin to sketch the gothic fantasy's deep mythology about warring families and troubled gods. The game also benefited from the social media users who shared delightfully embarrassing videos of their avatars being slashed, staggered and stabbed by horrific monsters.
A similar hype cycle that helped the publisher Bandai Namco sell more than 24 million copies of the original game is being used to build anticipation for Elden Ring's next chapter, Shadow of the Erdtree, which releases on June 21 for computers, PlayStation and Xbox.

This month, influencers were whisked to elaborately designed events.
In Los Angeles, a band played outside an exhibition hall where red curtains and fancy chandeliers hung above dozens of computer monitors. In Paris, officials cleared the pews of Chapelle Sainte-Jeanne-d'Arc to install gaming stations underneath the church's stained glass; a statue of the expansion's villain, Messmer the Impaler, towered over the altar. (Organizers told some attendees the event was a homage to the gothic design of churches and castles within the game.)
Most game designers attempt to ease players into their worlds through tutorials and progressively harder chapters. Miyazaki -- who has described himself in interviews as a masochist -- began Elden Ring with a surprise attack from a monster that kills nearly everyone in its path. The game's opening hours evoke a state of nature summarized by the Enlightenment philosopher Thomas Hobbes: "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short."
The many lore theorists who have spent years breaking down the symbolism of Elden Ring say there is considerable evidence that the developers examined the relationship between human nature and religion.
"Both George R. R. Martin and Miyazaki are big historical fiction people," said Rachel Cherry, a YouTuber who creates lore videos under the name Quelaag. Her research into the game has unearthed references to Mesopotamian and Greek architecture. There is a statue of Charlemagne based on a sculpture in the Palace of Versailles.
Miyazaki became a cult figure because of his punishing Dark Souls trilogy, which twisted the iconography of medieval Europe into bloody parables about man's doomed pursuit of immortality and power.
He and other FromSoftware designers were not available for comment about Elden Ring, said a representative for the studio. Martin, a creator of HBO's "House of the Dragon," declined to comment through his book publisher; the show's second season premieres on Sunday.
There are many YouTubers like Cherry who have subsidized their income by creating Elden Ring videos. A young baker from Texas who goes by LetMeSoloHer has amassed more than 400,000 subscribers by doing one thing: battling Malenia, the hardest boss in the game, on behalf of other players.
"People love a good underdog story," said the gamer, who estimates he has fought the katana-wielding boss more than 6,000 times. "I'm pretty shocked that I have gotten this far making meme videos."
Maliyah Corridon, a model and livestreamer based in Toronto, cried when she finally beat one of the game's first bosses, whose relentless attacks include a horde of minions swiping their swords.
"I bawled my eyes out," she said in an interview. "The game is so punishing that it genuinely changed my mind-set in life. I was the type of person who would give up if something was hard. Elden Ring forced me to keep trying something until I could overcome it."
Creators who have spent two years mining Elden Ring for content hope that Shadow of the Erdtree will bring new energy during a year with few major game releases on the calendar. The expansion invites players into a new area called the Land of Shadow to follow in the footsteps of a deity named Miquella, whose seemingly lifeless body was last seen inside a womb-like husk. It will include new weapons, enemies and lore.
Michael Currie's popular YouTube guides for Elden Ring helped players navigate through its many challenges, and he plans to continue with Shadow of the Erdtree.
"Failure isn't a stopping point, but where you should begin to alter your way of thinking," said Currie, whose children are now playing Elden Ring.
"The 14-year-old does a good job of approaching challenges differently," he said. "He learns when to block or strike, and then he bumps up the difficulty for a challenge. He wants to fail and work for his accomplishments."

INTERNATIONAL
An article on Wednesday about a trial in Florida in which Chiquita Brands was found liable for deaths that occurred during the Colombian Civil War misstated the circumstances during which the anecdote of the killing of a girl's mother and stepfather was provided. It was provided by a lawyer outside court and it involved a different case. It was not described in court nor was it part of the case in Florida.
BUSINESS
An article on Thursday about Sony Pictures acquiring the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema theater chain incorrectly described the purchase. It is a rare example of a Hollywood studio owning a theater chain, not the first in more than half a century.
ARTS
An article on Monday about what to watch on television this week described incorrectly the Discovery series "Six Schizophrenic Brothers." Although the series explores the same subject as the 2020 nonfiction book "Hidden Valley Road," by Robert Kolker, the series was not based on Mr. Kolker's book.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on Thursday about the political reporter Howard Fineman misstated the date of his birth in 1948. It was Nov. 17, not Nov. 19.

Newly Able, Sony Buys Alamo Chain Of Theaters: [Correction]

Full text: The deal is a rare example of a traditional Hollywood studio owning a movie theater chain.
Sony Pictures Entertainment is acquiring Alamo Drafthouse Cinema and will manage its 35 locations, a rare example of a traditional Hollywood studio's owning a theater chain.
The deal, announced Wednesday, followed the Justice Department's decision in 2020 to rescind the so-called Paramount consent decrees -- movie distribution rules dating to 1949 that forced the largest Hollywood studios to sell off their theater holdings. Those rules were intended to prevent studios from controlling the film business, from creation to exhibition.
In 2019, the Justice Department's antitrust chief at the time, Makan Delrahim, said changes in the entertainment industry "made it unlikely that the remaining defendants can reinstate their cartel." Sony's move could open the door to similar deals by other leading studios. In recent years, Netflix, the leading streaming company, has bought theaters to show films.
Alamo, the seventh-largest theater chain in North America, operates theaters in 25 metro areas across the United States and has invested in distinctive programming and food offerings in an attempt to lure in moviegoers away from major multiplexes.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Sony bought Alamo from Altamont Capital Partners and Fortress Investment Group, as well as the chain's founder, Tim League. Mr. League said the dine-in movie theater chain was "beyond thrilled" about the deal.
It comes at a time of financial trouble for Alamo and for the movie theater business as a whole. Several of Alamo's franchised locations filed for bankruptcy and closed this month, making Sony's move a potential lifeline for the struggling chain. Alamo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2021 before a private equity firm stepped in.
The cinemas will still operate under the Alamo Drafthouse brand, Sony said, though they will be managed by a newly formed division at Sony led by Michael Kustermann, Alamo's chief executive.
"Alamo Drafthouse has always held the craft of filmmaking and the theatrical experience in high esteem, which are fundamental shared values between our companies," said Tom Rothman, the chief executive of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group.
The industry has grappled with multiple headwinds in recent years, as the pandemic caused a slump in box office receipts -- and, more recently, a dismal start to the summer blockbuster season -- while Hollywood strikes chipped away at the number of movies that studios churned out.
Ticket sales in the United States and Canada for the year to date total just over $ 2.8 billion, a 26 percent decline from the same period last year, according to Comscore.

Paramount Ends Talks For Merger: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There were several hitches in the last week as Skydance, Paramount and its parent company, National Amusements, reached the final stages of negotiations.
Skydance's merger talks with Paramount were called off Tuesday after Paramount's controlling shareholder scuttled the deal, ending a drama that has captivated Hollywood for months.
The suspended negotiations derail attempts to unite Paramount -- the parent company of CBS, MTV and Nickelodeon -- with Skydance, the up-and-coming movie studio behind "Top Gun: Maverick" that is an important partner for Paramount's film business.
The deal died just as it neared fruition. Right before Paramount's special committee was to vote on the deal, lawyers for National Amusements emailed the committee to say it was ending the discussions. The email said that though National Amusements and Skydance had come to an agreement on economic terms, they could not agree on outstanding "noneconomic terms," according to two people familiar with the matter.
In a statement, Paramount's special committee confirmed that version of events, adding that "it did not vote on any potential transaction."
There were several hitches in the last week as Skydance, Paramount and its parent company, National Amusements, reached the final stages of negotiations. Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder, wanted Skydance to agree to provide some legal protection for the deal in case investors filed a lawsuit. Advisers worked through the weekend toward a compromise on those and other terms that had been outstanding. Even as the two sides made progress, a committee of Paramount's board members evaluating the plan fired a public relations firm it had been using.
The deal was ultimately doomed by a breakdown in negotiations between Skydance and National Amusements. Ms. Redstone was irked that Skydance's revised terms reduced the value of National Amusements to $ 1.7 billion from $ 2 billion, an adjustment that would have affected her family's personal holdings, according to two people familiar with the matter.
One sign of the tension emanating from both sides of the deal was the sheer length of negotiations. The talks stretched from late last year until this week, and were also rife with leaks, never a sign of harmonious negotiations.
"Sometimes the game ends with a goal-line stand," said Rich Greenfield, an analyst for LightShed Partners.
National Amusements said in a statement that it had not been able to reach "mutually acceptable terms" with Skydance. The statement included a note of cheer that seemed out of place given the deal's collapse.
"National Amusements is grateful to Skydance for their months of work in pursuing this potential transaction and looks forward to the ongoing, successful production collaboration between Paramount and Skydance," the statement said.
Skydance had no immediate comment.
It's unclear what the future holds for Paramount. The company was exploring a deal amid gale-force headwinds to the traditional media industry, including the demise of traditional television, a problem that is only likely to worsen. The company's share price has fallen precipitously in recent years, as investors have grown increasingly critical of the company's prospects.
While it was negotiating with Skydance, Paramount was mapping out a course of action in case no deal materialized. The company's Office of the C.E.O. -- three executives who succeeded Bob Bakish in that role this spring -- said during a shareholder meeting that they planned to explore a streaming joint venture and cut $ 500 million in costs.
Ms. Redstone has other options to pursue. National Amusements, the holding company that owns Paramount stock, has received expressions of interest from the media investor Edgar Bronfman Jr. and Steven Paul, the Hollywood executive best known for his work on the "Baby Geniuses" franchise.
Paramount's quest to sell itself over the last six months has been full of twists and turns worthy of its own season of "Succession." Since January, the company had come within inches of a deal with Skydance, entertained a separate courting from Apollo Global Management and Sony Pictures Entertainment, replaced its chief executive and winnowed its board to seven directors from 11. The company is still losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually on its streaming business, which includes the Paramount+ service.
Skydance is also at a crossroads. The deal's implosion is likely to put strain on its relationship with Paramount, with which it produces hit movies like "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One." David Ellison, the tech scion behind Skydance, personally lobbied Ms. Redstone to do the deal and was a primary figure in the discussions.

Big Opening For His Film Gives Smith A Career Lift: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Smith's first wide-release film since he slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars two years ago arrived to a hefty $ 56 million at the North American box office.
Moviegoers sent Will Smith a clear message over the weekend: We forgive you.
"Bad Boys: Ride or Die," the fourth entry in the Sony Pictures franchise -- and Mr. Smith's first wide release since he slapped Chris Rock at the Academy Awards in 2022 -- arrived to roughly $ 56 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada, according to Sony. That No. 1 result was a career milestone for Mr. Smith: He now has 15 first-place debuts as a leading man on his résumé.
"Ride or Die," which returned Mr. Smith to one of his signature roles, cost an estimated $ 100 million to make, not including marketing. It received positive reviews, with many critics noting a comedic moment that seemed to refer to Mr. Smith's behavior at the 2022 Oscars: Mr. Smith is slapped by his co-star, Martin Lawrence, and called a "bad boy."
Ticket buyers gave the R-rated "Ride or Die" an A-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls. The Rotten Tomatoes audience score stood at 97 percent positive on Saturday.
Prerelease surveys that track audience interest had indicated that "Ride or Die" would arrive to about $ 45 million in North American ticket sales. Sony was hoping for at least $ 30 million.
Hollywood as a whole was unsure what to expect. For a variety of reasons -- too few movies, movies that didn't appeal to wide audiences, changing consumer habits -- the summer box office has been in a deep freeze.
And Mr. Smith's ability to save the day was unclear. His most recent film, "Emancipation," released in late 2022 in a limited number of theaters and on Apple TV+, was largely ignored. The Q Scores Company, which measures the popularity of celebrities and brands, found in January that 19 percent of poll respondents viewed Mr. Smith in a positive light, down from 39 percent just before the 2022 Oscars.
The slap was just part of the problem. Mr. Smith returned to the Oscars stage minutes later to collect the prize for best actor and, instead of apologizing to Mr. Rock, gave a defiant speech. He then attended the Vanity Fair party, dancing to "Gettin' Jiggy Wit It," his chart-topping hit from 1998, as though nothing had happened.
Mr. Smith has since apologized repeatedly.
Sony's promotional campaign for "Ride or Die" was notable for its reliance on Mr. Smith. Instead of hiding the star, the studio did the opposite, making him appear omnipresent -- no worries here -- with a publicity tour that took him to eight cities in 12 days. Mr. Smith also participated in numerous marketing stunts, including arriving at the film's Los Angeles premiere on top of a double-decker bus while singing "Miami," his other 1998 hit.
The strong initial ticket sales for "Ride or Die" trailed those for the previous installment in the franchise, "Bad Boys for Life," which collected $ 62.5 million over its first three days in 2020, or about $ 76 million after accounting for inflation. "Bad Boys for Life" benefited from pent-up demand, coming out 17 years after "Bad Boys II." The franchise started in 1995.
Sony also had the No. 2 film of the weekend, "The Garfield Movie," which collected an estimated $ 10.3 million, for a three-week domestic total of nearly $ 70 million.
"The Watchers," a horror movie from New Line, which is part of Warner Bros., arrived in third place, selling an underwhelming $ 7 million or so in tickets. "The Watchers" cost $ 30 million to make, not including marketing, according to Deadline, an entertainment trade news site. It was directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan and produced by her father, the horror maestro M. Night Shyamalan.

Wheeling in the Years With Pat Sajak: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The host departs this week after more than four decades leading one of the most watched shows on syndicated American TV.
Since 1981, Pat Sajak has anchored "Wheel of Fortune" with an affable and even disposition. On Friday, viewers will see him give the big wheel his final spin, capping one of the most impressive runs in television history -- and the longest ever for the host of a nationally syndicated game show.
Sajak, 77, announced his retirement last year. In an interview with his daughter, Maggie, that aired Monday on "Good Morning America," he said he felt "surprisingly OK" going into his final week. The farewell episode was filmed in early April.
"I do know that somewhere along the line, we became more than a popular show, we became part of the popular culture, and more importantly, we became part of people's lives," he said. "And that's been awfully gratifying."
"Wheel of Fortune," which debuted in 1975 with Chuck Woolery as its host, became a hallmark of family-friendly programming -- a game show where everyone regardless of age or background could watch and play along, with Sajak as its trusted conductor. Perhaps fittingly, Ryan Seacrest, who rose to fame as the good-natured host of "American Idol," will take the reins from Sajak when the show returns for Season 42 in September.
It remains among the most watched syndicated shows on American TV. As of last year, it was still drawing more than nine million viewers daily, second only to "Jeopardy!" for syndicated shows. In the mid-1980s, more than 40 million viewers tuned in daily.
As Sajak's era ends, here's a look back at the show's legacy, impact and memorable moments.
Sajak's Run, By the Numbers
50,000: The approximate number of puzzles that have appeared on "Wheel of Fortune."
$ 250: The price of a vowel, which has never changed, even as the value of prizes and cash rewards has gone way up.
$ 250+ million: The amount "Wheel of Fortune" has awarded to contestants in cash and prizes since its syndication debut in 1983. Since the "Million Dollar Wedge" was introduced to the wheel in 2008, three contestants have each won $ 1 million.
$ 1,030,340: The amount Autumn Erhard, the biggest winner in the show's history, took home in cash and prizes.
7,800: The number of different outfits White has worn while at the puzzle board. She went almost 40 years without repeating a single look.
1997: The year the puzzle board went from analog to digital, allowing White to simply touch the monitors to reveal letters. Before the change, it took several minutes, instead of seconds, to reset the letters manually.
2022: The year the puzzle board was upgraded to a single LED screen. Its frame is outfitted with two sensors that activate the screen when White's hand breaks the plane in front of it.
Five or six: The number of shows generally filmed in a single day, with Sajak and White changing clothes between tapings to make them seem as if they were shot on different days.
Vanna White, More Than a Sidekick
Vanna White, the show's famous letter-turner, joined Sajak in 1982, and their relaxed, familiar chemistry has been a key part of the show's enduring success. When Sajak announced his retirement, White, 67, said on social media that she "couldn't be happier to have shared the stage" with Sajak. "Who could have imagined we'd still be at it 41 seasons later?"
By some accounts, White has walked well over 2,000 miles on that stage, strolling back and forth to reveal letters. (The first letter she ever turned was the "T" in the puzzle "General Hospital.") She even stepped in to host "Wheel of Fortune" for a few weeks in 2019, while Sajak was away for an emergency surgery.
Over the decades, White has arguably eclipsed Sajak as a pop culture figure, not only becoming a household name, but also being shouted out in a surprising number of lyrics, particularly in rap songs including Nelly's hit 2000 track, "Ride Wit Me."
White, however, is not departing with Sajak, though how much longer she will stick with the show remains to be seen. She agreed to a contract extension through the 2025-2026 season, a deal that reportedly included a notable raise.
"When I heard that Pat was retiring, I thought maybe I should retire, too. But I'm not ready," she told TV Insider last month. "We'll see toward the end of those two years how I feel. I thank God after all these years that I still love my job."
In 1980, before she was famous, White appeared on another game show, "The Price Is Right," as a contestant. Wearing a T-shirt that read "Get Serious," she was picked for contestants' row where she was welcomed by Bob Barker, the third longest-running game show host behind only Sajak and Alex Trebek, who hosted "Jeopardy!" for 37 years.
Freewheeling Early Days
In a 2012 interview on ESPN2's "Dan Le Batard is Highly Questionable," Sajak shared some gossip that, given the squeaky clean image of the show, was pretty memorable. According to Sajak, back in those early days, he and White would sometimes have several margaritas at a nearby restaurant while they waited for prizes to be brought onto the show's set in Burbank, Calif., which usually took a couple of hours.
"Vanna and I would go across and have two or three or six, and then come and do the last shows and have trouble recognizing the alphabet," Sajak said. "I had a great time," he added. "I have no idea if the shows were any good, but no one said anything, so I guess I did OK."
What's Next for Sajak?
Sajak has been "figurine-like and amiably showbizzy" onscreen, as The New York Times television critic James Poniewozik put it last year, presiding over a show that has long been a 7 o'clock staple in homes across the country.
In recent years, though, Sajak has become more politically outspoken off-air, writing occasional columns expressing his conservatism and more frequently sharing his thoughts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In 2014, for example, Sajak posted that "global warming alarmists are unpatriotic racists knowingly misleading for their own ends." (He later said he was joking.) In 2022, a photo of Sajak with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a far-right Republican from Georgia, was widely circulated, and criticized, online.
Sajak has also served on the board for the Claremont Institute, a right-wing think tank in California, and is chairman of the board of trustees of Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian school in Michigan, at which Justice Clarence Thomas delivered the 2016 commencement speech.
Sajak hasn't said whether he will continue with such pursuits, but he is expected to consult on "Wheel of Fortune" for three years. One somewhat surprising gig for Sajak was announced right as his time on "Wheel" concluded -- starring in a stage production of "Prescription: Murder" next summer at the Hawaii Theater, opposite longtime Honolulu newscaster Joe Moore. "Prescription: Murder," a 1968 television movie written by William Link and Richard Levinson, was the basis for the TV series "Columbo."
In the interview with his daughter, Sajak said he was open to working on new projects, but added that he is "perfectly happy if it just means that I'll continue with my crossword puzzles and play with grandchildren," adding, to rib his daughter, "hint, hint, hint, no pressure."
In the Viral Era
Long before memes, cultural cache was all about catchphrases, and "Wheel of Fortune" had a doozy: "Can I buy a vowel?" -- which became a humorous way to convey confusion in general or to request more information of any kind.
Now, "Wheel of Fortune," which could be considered the original Wordle, gets meme-ified with remarkable frequency on TikTok and Instagram: in puzzle board parodies, which can be generated online, or when contestants fail in hilarious or embarrassing ways.
In 2020, a contestant went viral for guessing "chasing tail" in the bonus round; "kicking back" was the answer. And just a couple of weeks ago, a contestant scanned the puzzle board, clicked his buzzer and yelled out, "Right in the butt!" The incorrect guess has been viewed millions of times as it made its way across social media. The puzzle's actual answer? "This is the best!"

Will Smith Taps Into Nostalgia on His Comeback Trail: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Bad Boys: Ride or Die," the latest entry in a nearly three-decade- old franchise, will be Smith's first wide-release film since he slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars in 2022.
During the Latin pop star J Balvin's set at Coachella in April, a surprise guest star suddenly appeared onstage: Will Smith, wearing a familiar black suit and sunglasses, launched into the title song of "Men in Black," his 1997 Hollywood blockbuster.
It was the beginning of a frenetic spring for Smith as he carefully re-enters the public eye to promote "Bad Boys: Ride or Die," his first wide-release movie since he slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars in 2022, a move that threatened to derail his career.
Smith has been back walking red carpets, bantering on "The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon" and eating spicy chicken until his eyes watered on "Hot Ones," the popular YouTube show. He told Fallon his publicity tour had taken him to eight cities in 12 days, with stops in Dubai and in Riyadh for what he described as the first Hollywood premiere in Saudi Arabia.
"Bad Boys: Ride or Die," the latest entry in a nearly three-decade old franchise, is opening nationwide on Friday. The film industry will be closely watching how it does to see whether the moviegoing public is ready to welcome Smith back after an event so shocking and ignominious that it achieved proper-noun status: the Slap.
Whether by accident or agreement, the Slap has not come up much in Smith's prerelease publicity blitz. But the film itself seems to refer to it, archly, as several critics have noted: In it, Smith gets slapped by his co-star, Martin Lawrence, and called a "bad boy."
Lawrence appeared on "The Tonight Show" with Smith and praised him effusively. "He is one of the most professional actors out there, most talented actors out there, he has a brilliant mind, he's a genius and he's upstanding," he said.
Some analysts said that Smith's decision to tap into nostalgia for his return was savvy.
"It was smart to make a movie that's part of a franchise, that people are familiar with, and his audience, his core fans, would like," said Fred Cook, the former chairman of the public relations agency Golin and a professor at the University of Southern California.
Smith, 55, broke out in the late 1980s as part of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince. His sitcom, NBC's "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," ran for six seasons in the 1990s, leaving behind a theme song that to this day many a Millennial can recite on command.
Beginning in 1995, Smith starred in a string of hit movies -- the original "Bad Boys," "Independence Day," "Men in Black," "Wild Wild West" -- that established him as a premier leading man who had achieved broad popularity.
"He was definitely seen in the mid-to-late 1990s and 2000s as a star who transcended race," said Brandy Monk-Payton, a professor of media studies at Fordham University. "He had blockbuster films and crossover status, being able to bring in not only Black but also white audiences."
Joe Quenqua, a veteran communications and crisis consultant, said, "There are few people in this industry who were as beloved as Will Smith prior to this incident."
The night of the Slap, Smith seemed poised to take his career to a whole new level: he was about to win his first Academy Award for his performance as Venus and Serena Williams's father and tennis coach in "King Richard."
What happened next, millions watched on live television. Rock, the comedian who was hosting the Oscars, joked about the short haircut of Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, who had spoken of her alopecia diagnosis. Will Smith, sitting next to her, walked up to Rock, slapped him hard in the face and, after returning to his seat shouted, "Keep my wife's name out of your mouth," using an expletive that ABC bleeped out of the telecast.
Minutes later, Smith collected his trophy with a defiant speech. "Richard Williams was a fierce defender of his family," Smith said. "Art imitates life."
Days later, Smith issued a contrite statement and resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. A week later, the Academy banned him from attending the Oscars for 10 years. His next movie, "Emancipation" (2022), a $ 120-million film that had been seen as a likely awards season darling, was issued to a whimper. Then Pinkett Smith released a memoir revealing that the couple had been separated since 2016.
A spokeswoman for Smith declined to comment for this article. A spokeswoman for Sony, which is distributing and producing "Bad Boys: Ride or Die," did not respond to an inquiry.
At the Los Angeles premiere of "Bad Boys: Ride or Die," where Smith was greeted by cheers on Hollywood Boulevard, a reporter from Variety asked him about the fans who have stuck by him. "It's not just here," Smith replied, standing beside Lawrence. "It's all over the world. Every time we step out together, it's nothing but love. I think the fans are ride or die also."

Out of a Blur Of Abundance, A Sharp Focus: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The festival favors abundance, which can make it easy for cinema fans (and critics) to miss the loveliest trees for the sheer breadth of forest.
Early in the animated film "Boys Go to Jupiter," premiering at this year's Tribeca Festival, an indie electronic beat kicks in. Like a music video rendered on Kid Pix, the sequence that follows finds the mulleted Rozebud (voiced by the singer Miya Folick) tending to neon citrus trees while crooning a melody as catchy as it is ethereal. The film, from the artist Julian Glander, belongs to a subset of Tribeca movies that use music in startling and adventurous ways. Their soundscapes conjure vision and feeling, as well as that ineffable thing sometimes called vibe.
Running from Wednesday through June 16, the Tribeca Festival -- it dropped "film" from its name in 2021 -- is big on vibe, for better and for worse. This is an event that embraces virtual reality, artificial intelligence and immersive installations, that pairs its screenings with concerts and its concerts with visuals, that touts buzzword-friendly panels about brands, innovation or brand innovation. Spilling across downtown Manhattan and a little into Williamsburg, Tribeca favors multimedia abundance, which can make it easy for cinema fans (and critics) to miss the loveliest trees for the sheer breadth of forest.
My favorite Tribeca selection also ranks in my top films of the year so far: Nathan Silver's fidgety and finely tuned "Between the Temples," a sensational Jewish love comedy about a dispirited cantor (Jason Schwartzman) and his adult bat mitzvah student (Carol Kane). I caught it at Sundance, and feel a sacred duty to spread the word. But I primarily dedicate my Tribeca time to sampling world premieres -- movies that haven't played at other festivals and need a nudge to break out.
In my hunt for gems, I often have luck in the Viewpoints section, designed to house films that push the boundaries of form and perspective. It was there that I made contact with the otherworldly "Boys Go to Jupiter," a memorable standout, and not only because of Rozebud's earworm. Following a cast of slackers and crackpots in suburban Florida, the video game-like musical comedy marries gummy 3-D graphics and stoned-guy humor with sly commentary on hustle culture and the gig economy. The ensemble of avatars is voiced by a corps d'elite of quirky comedians like Cole Escola and Julio Torres.
Glander's film would pair nicely with "Eternal Playground," a Parisian drama that follows Gaspard (Andranic Manet), a middle school music teacher. Shot in sumptuous 16 mm, this labor of love from the filmmakers Pablo Cotten and Joseph Rozé opens just before the bell rings for summer break, although Gaspard won't be leaving the premises: He and five childhood pals have resolved to secretly camp out in the vacant school while classes are out for summer. A French New Wave-inflected love letter to the schoolyard, "Eternal Playground" accompanies the crew as they sing, romp, reminisce and memorialize a late friend.
Among this year's Tribeca documentaries, music and its industry dominate, which isn't a surprise given that glossy musician biographies have (alongside true crime) been clogging up the nonfiction landscape for some time. My favorite Tribeca music documentary was a homespun affair: Elizabeth Ai's "New Wave," a soft scream of a film about '80s Vietnamese diaspora culture and style. Framed as an address to Ai's baby daughter, the movie uses the Eurodisco music phenomenon -- known as New Wave -- to explore Ai's upbringing by Vietnamese refugees and her longtime estrangement from her mother, who ran nail salons to provide for relatives.
Which brings me to another theme at Tribeca this year: parenting. That thread runs just beneath the topsoil of "The Freshly Cut Grass," a naturalistic drama that tracks the parallel stories of Natalia (Marina de Tavira) and Pablo (Joaquín Furriel), middle-aged academics seeking respite from their family lives through affairs with their students. By mirroring the tales, sometimes with even the same lines of dialogue, the Argentine director Celina Murga underscores the points at which Natalia and Pablo's cases diverge because of subtle differences in gender roles and age gap dynamics.
"Sacramento," directed by the actor Michael Angarano, takes the anxieties of first-time fatherhood as the premise for a dopey buddy comedy. The movie follows Rickey (Angarano), who persuades his friend Glenn (Michael Cera), a soon-to-be dad, to go on a road trip. Be aware: there's an extended M.M.A. wrestling sequence packed with kicks to the groin. What makes the movie interesting, though, is not its male clowning but the credit it pays to the women acting as their emotional custodians, like Glenn's pregnant wife, Rosie (Kristen Stewart), and Rickey's droll ex, Tallie (Maya Erskine, Angarano's real-life partner with whom he shares a child).
Movies about maternity and its discontents have been surging in the wake of pandemic seclusion, especially ones that take aim at the perfect mom mythos by showing how childbearing and rearing -- once considered sacred cows -- can actually feel like torture. Too often, that torture is conveyed through concrete horror scenarios, wringing gore from gynecology or jump scares from postpartum insomnia. Despite its nondescript title, Elizabeth Sankey's incisive "Witches" not only eschews that trend, it actually reverses it: Rather than sublimate mothering's dark side into genre tropes, the film uncovers how one of horror's most reliable figures -- the witch -- arose from a centuries-old mistrust in troubled mothers.
Using movie clips and narration, Sankey begins with a survey of the witch as a symbol in modern fiction. She then focuses the portrait by recounting her experience of postpartum depression and anxiety, which culminated in a stay at a psychiatric facility for new mothers and infants. Sankey calls on peers and professionals to add their stories of pain and internalized stigma, and finally binds the picture together by drawing a line between her struggles and those of female victims -- "witches" -- who were once burned at the stake.
An intimate testimony with a strong pedagogic streak, "Witches" serves as a useful reminder that dissecting everyday images can expose startling truths. At the end of the documentary, Sankey pulls back the camera to reveal the soundstage where she conducted her interviews. Dramatic sets that previously served only as blurry backdrops -- a decaying nursery, an overgrown witch's atelier -- are shown in intricate detail. It's then that you realize that, even while out of focus, the moody scenery was stirring up something important: a vibe.

Top Music Producer Accused of Rape in Lawsuit: [National Desk]

Full text: In a lawsuit, a former protégée of Terius Gesteelde-Diamant says he entangled her in an abusive relationship. Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant called the allegations "untrue and defamatory."
Terius Gesteelde-Diamant, a top songwriter and producer for Beyoncé, Rihanna and other stars under the name The-Dream, has been accused of rape and sexual battery in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by a former protégée.
Chanaaz Mangroe, who performed as Channii Monroe, says in her suit that in 2015, Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant used promises to promote her career to entangle her in an abusive relationship in which he repeatedly forced her to have sex, strangled her and once made a video recording of an intimate encounter and threatened to show it to others.
As The-Dream, Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant is one of the most powerful producers behind the scenes of the music industry, an eight-time Grammy winner who helped make some of the biggest pop and R&B hits of the last two decades, including Rihanna's "Umbrella," Justin Bieber's "Baby" and Mariah Carey's "Touch My Body." He has forged a particularly close creative bond with Beyoncé, credited as a writer and producer on her signature female-empowerment anthems like "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" and "Break My Soul," and working on each of the superstar's studio albums since 2008.
But Ms. Mangroe's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, portrays Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant as an abusive Svengali-type figure, dangling the promise of fame and success before an aspiring artist while controlling her life, forcing her into unwanted sex and physically abusing her.
The suit also accuses Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant of sex trafficking, a claim that has been cited in a number of recent civil lawsuits -- including against Sean Combs, the hip-hop mogul known as Diddy or Puff Daddy -- over accusations of harboring or transporting a victim of sexual assault by fraud or coercion. Ms. Mangroe's suit cites the Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, a California law that allows people to bring sexual assault cases even if the statute of limitations for incidents they allege have expired.
"What Dream did to me made it impossible to live the life I envisioned for myself and pursue my goals as a singer and songwriter," Ms. Mangroe said in a statement. "Ultimately, my silence has become too painful, and I realized that I need to tell my story to heal. I hope that doing so will also help others and prevent future horrific abuse."
In a statement supplied by a representative, Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant denied the accusations.
"These claims are untrue and defamatory," he said in the statement. "I oppose all forms of harassment and have always strived to help people realize their career goals. As someone committed to making a positive impact on my fellow artists and the world at large, I am deeply offended and saddened by these accusations."
Ms. Mangroe, 33, was born in the Netherlands and wanted to break into the music business as a pop singer and songwriter. According to her complaint, she was working in the United States in late 2014 when an associate of Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant asked her to send examples of her music. In January 2015, she flew to Atlanta to meet Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant, who took her to a strip club, began recording with her and, according to the complaint, "told her that he would make her the next Beyoncé and Rihanna."
Within days, according to Ms. Mangroe's lawsuit, Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant began to pressure her into sex, telling her it was "part of the process." At a house with a studio where they were working, the suit says, he locked her in a dark room and "would only stop aggressively having sex with her once she said that she loved him."
More sexual encounters continued, the suit says, with Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant sometimes holding her down and refusing to use a condom despite her protests. At the same time, the suit says, he made business promises to her, suggesting he could make her the opening act for Beyoncé's next tour.
According to the complaint, Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant then became more controlling and violent: He placed her in an Atlanta hotel, had his security staff monitor her movements, and berated her unless she regularly checked in with him. After Ms. Mangroe complained about bedbugs in her hotel room, her court papers say, Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant exploded in anger, telling her she was a disloyal "brat" and blaming the attention he spent on her for delays to Beyoncé's next album.
He plied her with alcohol and marijuana, the complaint says, and once forced Ms. Mangroe to have sex with him while he recorded it, and later threatened to show the footage to other people. During sex, the complaint says, Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant often placed a gun next to her, which she saw as a warning.
At a movie theater one day, Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant asked Ms. Mangroe to perform oral sex on him, the complaint says. After she said no, he became angry and forced her to have sex, in view of the other theater patrons. "It was a physically painful encounter," the complaint says. Later that same day, the suit says, Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant took Ms. Mangroe to his van and again forced her to have sex, pinning her down and placing his hands over her mouth and nose, leaving her unable to breathe.
Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant signed Ms. Mangroe to his record label, Contra Paris, and arranged for a distribution deal for her with Epic Records, a major label owned by Sony. The court papers say that by the summer of 2015, Ms. Mangroe was trying to escape from Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant's control and prepare for the release of an album, but her efforts were unsuccessful.
According to the complaint, Ms. Mangroe reported Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant's abuse to an Epic executive, who told her that "she needed to figure out a way to work with Dream again." In July 2016, according to the complaint, Ms. Mangroe was told that Epic was dropping her because Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant, who still controlled her artist contract, had not delivered music. Epic is also named as a defendant in the suit.
A spokeswoman for Sony declined to comment. Representatives of Beyoncé and Rihanna did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Gesteelde-Diamant, who used to go by the name Terius Nash, has been accused of violence against women in the past. In 2014, he was charged with assault on allegations that he kicked, punched and choked a former girlfriend who was eight months pregnant; prosecutors dropped the case the following year, saying they could not prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.
In her lawsuit, Ms. Mangroe is represented by Douglas H. Wigdor and Meredith A. Firetog, who have also represented Casandra Ventura, the singer known as Cassie. Ms. Ventura's lawsuit against Mr. Combs, filed in November -- and settled after just one day -- was the first of six suits by women who have accused Mr. Combs of sexual assault.
"This is yet another horrific example," Mr. Wigdor and Ms. Firetog said in a statement, "of how men in the music industry use their power and influence to manipulate and harm others."

Full text: In a strong month for indie games, Hauntii is a hunt for memories and Crow Country offers retro survival in a creepy amusement park. The origami-like Paper Trail feels a bit thin.
In a month rife with original indie games, including Animal Well and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, there has seemingly been something for every player. The creativity continues with Hauntii, Crow Country and Paper Trail, even though one stumbles a bit.
Hauntii
The inventive characters in Hauntii speak few words, but those words can pierce. "I hate you," one cute devil says after you climb meandering steps to reach him.
This 10-hour adventure game by the studio Moonloop can be slightly subversive as well, all the while musing upon what the afterlife means. Hauntii, a tiny, faceless Druid-esque being, embarks upon his trek energetically. But the point of his cowl hood droops behind his head, perhaps from the sheer weight of finding out he's died.
In this invitingly artful, mostly monochromatic world, Hauntii soon meets an Eternian, seemingly an angel with flowing hair. Hauntii's green eyes become wide with attraction. She lifts him to the heavens, where they ascend hand in hand to observe sparkling constellations -- a wonderful representation of love at first sight.
As it can be with relationships, she leaves. To find her, it's key to remember who you once were by collecting lustrous stars hidden among trees or locked away in cages. As you search, the characters encourage you to stay in their world, a place where you can always be safe. There's nothing good where the Eternian is, they caution.
Yet it's not safe where you are either.
A giant, chained Bell Guardian, its mouth twisted down like a Melpomene mask of tragedy, employs minions to kill you. Hopping beings that look like Q-bert with legs might stomp on you. With haunt ability, I inhabited these trumpet-nosed creatures to jump quickly past enemies. If you stray from your appointed path into a roadless blackness, red eyes appear nightmarishly. Linger for too long, and you'll lose your life.
Haunting to shake pine trees reveals pieces of hearts for health, and an occasional brilliant star. Collect enough and you're lofted into the heavens to complete a constellation. From high in space, silent stick figure vignettes appear to show momentary hints of your life, like tender parental hugs after being bullied by a teacher. That these memories have so much emotional impact is a credit to the creators.
Hauntii's most gobsmacking achievement is the Wickland Carnival. On the midway, a gangly grim reaper sells ride tickets in exchange for a portion of your soul. The line is long with adults and children, all happily queuing up to sell their very essence. As the camera pulls back, the long shot reveals a spectacular roller coaster that rumbles at the north end, looping twice as it's bathed in fireworks and its harried passengers scream gleefully. Gaining admission to the rickety ride is another puzzle Hauntii needs to solve before his journey through Eternity is complete.
Crow Country
A homage to the original PlayStation era, Crow Country is made for nostalgia lovers who don't mind graphics that aren't presented in 4K, and who love a puzzle game that requires concentration and note taking. It is especially inspired by Resident Evil, from 1996, the console's classic survival horror game.
Here, you are Mara Forest, a brown-haired investigator in a white dress who searches for the missing entrepreneur Mr. Crow. She's a no-nonsense, generally delightful presence who has limited ammo to protect herself from the grossly mutated creatures that appear in an abandoned amusement park, the eponymous Crow Country.
Inside, the overall mood is creepy rather than horrifying. Eeriness pervades. The soundtrack, full of long, tense notes and gruesome screams, gets under your skin. Nothing is really as it appears. There's the mechanical Great Fairy of Fairest Forest, which spins around to reveal a walkway once the proper code is entered, leading to more disturbing denizens. A tiny house requires crawling on hands and knees like Lewis Carroll's Alice.
The puzzles in Crow Country, from SFB Games, move from simple to quite complex, and there's much backtracking hither and yon for clues and items to aid your tasks. I used a reporter's notebook to write down hints that the park's staff members left on the walls. The world map is quite extensive with its many rooms, goony surprises and mild humor. One area is called the Mush Room. Inside, the Mushroom King sits alone at a long, dark dining table with unlit candles.
The mutated beings often come from the grim shadows. Shooting them with a laser-guided pistol isn't always accurate. And turning to run away using the D-pad is a learning experience. (If you merely want to explore Crow Country's many appealing peculiarities without fear of being attacked, there's a mode that stops mutants from appearing.)
Yet the primary answer to the mystery is one you might overlook. If you miss checking your inventory to read a crumpled yellow paper that Mr. Crow handed over during the 10-hour game's finale, you won't realize the potentially dire situation the world may encounter in the future. One eerie battle is won. But the indication is that there may be more later, thus setting up a potential sequel.
Paper Trail
In Paper Trail, a top-down fairy tale, you fold, unfold and fold again until a path is revealed to pass an obstacle in a world rendered in moody watercolor backgrounds. I quickly recalled my childhood distractions like folding paper into planes and more intricate origami but ultimately became flummoxed by all the folding.
Here in the seaside community of Southfold, a lightning storm complete with damaging winds wreaks havoc, and the eel fisherman who has been trapped because a bridge crumbled asks for assistance. Dragging and folding the game's edges as if the screen were a piece of paper, you discover a new way to traverse.
For some reason, the fisherman worries whether Aunt Maude survived the storm. How does he know her? Do they have a secret relationship? It's not revealed, but the puzzles become more intricate from there.
Maude has been eating pine cones because she's been trapped by the squall's damage. That's when Paige, an 18-year-old aspiring astrophysicist whose parents don't want her to leave for college, comes to the rescue.
Paper Trail, an eight-hour experience by Newfangled Games, is published by Netflix and playable on smartphones and all major consoles. I chose to indulge on Nintendo's Switch because of the larger touch-screen. It's not always easy, however, to pull portions of the screen to lead Paige to a new path. It's more difficult when the virtual paper edges sometimes become stuck, regardless of the hint button's how-to diagrams.
Paige moves though some compelling environments, beautifully detailed and inked like a children's book. I particularly lingered over a sunset pond just outside a cave in which she takes refuge. Fold the edges properly to reveal a green-hued morning with a white antlered stag far in the distance.
After journeys through swamps and snow, Paige eventually gets to college. Despite the apparent symbolism that the path to higher education isn't always an easy one, this trek wasn't always worth the effort. The story is paper thin and the origami-influenced gameplay mechanic doesn't always bend the space-time continuum.
Hauntii was reviewed on a PC and is also available on all major consoles. Crow Country was reviewed on the PlayStation 5 and is also available on the PC and Xbox Series X|S. Paper Trail was reviewed on the Switch and is also available on all major consoles and smartphones.

Grayson Murray, 30, Professional Golfer On a Comeback Who Won Two Titles: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Murray, who was outspoken about his depression and alcohol abuse, had begun a comeback after several volatile years, winning this year's Sony Open in Hawaii.
Grayson Murray, the professional golfer who won two PGA Tour titles and was outspoken about his battles with depression and alcohol, died on Saturday. He was 30.
His death was confirmed in a statement on Saturday by the PGA Tour. He died by suicide, according to a PGA Tour statement that was released on Sunday on behalf of his parents.
"We have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone," the statement said. "It's surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world."
After a successful 40-foot putt to win the Sony Open in Hawaii in January, Murray rose to 46th in the Official World Golf Ranking, a career high. The event marked the height of a comeback run after several volatile years as Murray struggled with his mental health.
In a news conference after winning the Sony Open, Murray said that for a time he would drink during tournament weeks.
"Best thing and worst thing that ever happened to me was winning my rookie year, but also feeling like I was invincible," he said. "I'm a different man now, and I would not be in this position right now, today, if I didn't put that drink down eight months ago."
He added that he had attended rehabilitation for a month. "I hope I can inspire a lot of people going forward that have their own issues," he said. Murray had failed to gain PGA Tour status for several months last year after a series of off-course events mirrored a decline in his play.
An alcohol-related incident at a hotel bar in Hawaii in 2021 led to his suspension from the PGA Tour. Afterward, he posted to social media.
"Why was I drunk?" he wrote, adding that he was an "alcoholic that hates everything to do with the PGA Tour life and that's my scapegoat."
The golfer Phil Mickelson, who has struggled with a gambling addiction, responded at the time on social media, saying "If I can help in any way I'd be happy to."
This year, Murray played well enough to qualify for the Masters Tournament and P.G.A. Championship. On Friday, he withdrew from the second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, citing an illness.
Grayson Murray was born on Oct. 1, 1993, in Raleigh, N.C., according to an ESPN biography. Mr. Murray is survived by his parents, Eric and Terry, and his brother, Cameron, and sister, Erica, according to the statement.
He attended Wake Forest, East Carolina and Arizona State Universities, and at 16 he became the second-youngest player to enter the Korn Ferry Tour, according to the PGA Tour.
He continued to gain prominence, playing in the U.S. Open at the age of 19 and clinching a win at the 2017 Barbasol Championship, sinking a five-foot putt for a one-stroke victory.
After losing his PGA Tour card for the 2023 season, and following an angry outburst directed at Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour's commissioner, he seemed to have found his swing again. He won two Korn Ferry Tour tournaments last year, regaining his PGA Tour eligibility, and finished in the top 10 at two events.

'Furiosa' Fails to Reach Box Office Expectations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Memorial Day weekend ticket sales in North America are expected to total $ 125 million, down 40 percent from last year.
Hollywood expected "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga" to scorch the box office over the holiday weekend. Instead, the big-budget Warner Bros. prequel iced it over.
"Furiosa," which cost $ 168 million to make, not including tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs, collected an estimated $ 25.6 million in the United States and Canada from Thursday night to Sunday. Box office analysts expected the film to take in about $ 5.4 million on Monday, for a holiday-weekend total of $ 31 million.
That would be the worst Memorial Day weekend result in 43 years after adjusting for inflation -- ever since "Bustin' Loose," a comedic drama starring Richard Pryor, collected $ 24 million in 1981. (Box office records exclude 2020, when most theaters were closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.)
The franchise's previous chapter, "Mad Max: Fury Road," took in $ 45.4 million in 2015, or roughly $ 61 million in today's dollars -- and that was without the benefit of a holiday weekend.
Hollywood had high expectations for "Furiosa," which Warner Bros. premiered at the Cannes Film Festival; the movie received exceptional reviews. On Sunday, however, it was unclear whether "Furiosa" would manage even first place at the box office. Analysts said the poorly reviewed "Garfield" (Sony), which cost $ 60 million to make, could inch ahead. It could also be a tie.
Sony declared victory, saying it expected "Garfield," produced and financed by Alcon Entertainment, to be No. 1, with $ 31.8 million in ticket sales. "With summer holidays beginning this week, the film is well-positioned for a long theatrical run," Sony said, adding that it had successfully "relaunched" the lasagna-loving character as a movie franchise.
Why did fewer moviegoers turn out for "Furiosa" than expected? Warner Bros. declined to comment, but the film capital was rife with theories. One involved Anya Taylor-Joy, who played the title role in "Furiosa."
The 28-year-old actress has been ascending for nearly a decade, gaining attention in 2015 for "The Witch," an art house horror movie, and winning awards in 2020 for playing a troubled chess prodigy in "The Queen's Gambit," a Netflix mini-series. But she had never anchored a big-budget summer movie before.
Increasing the pressure, Ms. Taylor-Joy took over the role of Furiosa from the Oscar-winning Charlize Theron, now 48, who helped turn "Mad Max: Fury Road" into a hit in 2015.
"Moviegoers do not want prequel origin stories," where significant franchise characters are "portrayed not by the actor who originated and defined them, but by a younger, less-famous performer," Scott Mendelson, a box office analyst who publishes a subscription newsletter, wrote on Saturday.
"Furiosa," directed by George Miller and co-starring Chris Hemsworth, may have been released too soon after the similar-looking "Dune: Part Two," which delivered giant ticket sales in March, some film executives said. At the same time, they added, "Furiosa" may have been released too long after "Fury Road," allowing the "Mad Max" fan base to cool.
There has also been a lack of momentum at the box office, noted Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore media analyst. Hollywood's summer season started with "The Fall Guy," which arrived to $ 28 million in ticket sales earlier this month -- the lowest summer kickoff since 1995. The April box office suffered from a shortage of movies, which studios blamed on lingering fallout from union strikes in 2023.
"The current malaise shows the importance of the health of the overall marketplace in the months leading up to this all-important moviegoing season," Mr. Dergarabedian said in an email.
Theaters in the United States and Canada were expected to sell about $ 125 million in tickets over the weekend, down roughly 40 percent from last year, according to Comscore. For the year to date, ticket sales in the two countries total $ 2.6 billion, down 22 percent from the same period a year ago, Comscore said.
Mr. Dergarabedian is an optimist, however.
"It's not game over for theaters this summer as many have asserted," he said, noting that sequels like "Inside Out 2," "Despicable Me 4" and "Deadpool & Wolverine" could arrive as major hits in June and July. If those films deliver, he said, Hollywood can salvage "the perception of the movie theater business as a viable and relevant part of the entertainment ecosystem."

'Romeo and Juliet' Coming to Broadway This Fall: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: A production featuring the screen stars, with music by Jack Antonoff, will open in October at Circle in the Square.
Rachel Zegler has already played a Juliet-inspired figure, starring as Maria in the 2021 film adaptation of "West Side Story." And Kit Connor has played a Romeo of sorts, starring as a yearning adolescent in the boy-meets-boy television series "Heartstopper."
Now the two actors are bringing a new production of "Romeo and Juliet" to Broadway. Their version, which seems to be leaning into the alienation of youth in a world of violent adults, is to begin performances Sept. 26 and to open Oct. 24 at Circle in the Square Theater.
The production, which announced its timing and location on Wednesday, has said little about its concept, but there are indications it will be influenced by contemporary ideas: The show is to feature music by Jack Antonoff, the Grammy-winning producer best known for his successful collaborations with Taylor Swift, and it is being marketed with a vulgarity about the plight of young people. On Wednesday, the show released a video of Zegler and Connor, in contemporary clothing and setting, flirting and dancing to a song from Bleachers, which is Antonoff's band.
"Romeo and Juliet" is one of Shakespeare's most popular plays, and this will be its 37th production on Broadway, according to the Internet Broadway Database. This production is to be directed by Sam Gold, a Tony winner for "Fun Home" who has previously directed Broadway productions of "Macbeth" and "King Lear" and who is directing this season's revival of "An Enemy of the People." Sonya Tayeh, the Tony-winning choreographer of "Moulin Rouge!", will add a dancer's sensibility to the production; she is being credited with "movement."
This revival, first announced last month, is being produced by Seaview, an increasingly prolific production company founded by Greg Nobile and Jana Shea and partially owned by Sony Music Masterworks.

Well, at Least The Cartoon Cat Is Still Orange: [Review]

Full text: Garfield, voiced by Chris Pratt, is joined by Samuel L. Jackson as his father, in an inert big-screen adaptation that fundamentally misunderstands its protagonist.
Since Garfield's debut in the 1970s, Jim Davis's orange tabby has become one of the most successful brands to evolve from the humble American comic strip. And fortified by a reliable stream of cartoon shows, video games and a couple of bland Bill Murray-voiced films in the early 2000s, Garfield is now one of the more enduring images of the American imagination.
Even if you've never consumed Garfield in any prolonged form, you probably know who he is and what he represents. (Mondays: reviled. Lasagna: beloved. Effort of any kind: a fundamental misunderstanding of life.)
It's particularly odd, then, that the latest iteration of the Garfield empire, the animated "The Garfield Movie," somehow doesn't. The film, directed by Mark Dindal, is an inert adaptation that mostly tries to skate by on its namesake. In other words, it's a Garfield movie that strangely doesn't feel as if Garfield as we know him is really there at all.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Part of this can be attributed to the voice -- Chris Pratt, an overly spunky casting choice that was doomed from the start -- but there's also a built-in defect to the very concept of the big-screen Garfield treatment. An animated, animal-centric children's movie tends to require a narrative structure of action-packed adventure -- the antithesis of Garfield the cat's raison d'être.
Instead, after a perfunctory origin story of Garfield's life with his owner, Jon (Nicholas Hoult), and dog companion, Odie (Harvey Guillén), the film is quickly set into adventure mode when Garfield and Odie are kidnapped by a pair of henchman dogs working for a vengeful cat named Jinx (Hannah Waddingham). Garfield's estranged father, Vic (Samuel L. Jackson), quickly comes to the rescue, but it's Vic that Jinx is really after. After Jinx demands a truck full of milk as payment for a botched job she took the fall for, Vic, with Garfield and Odie in tow, are off to find a way to pay his debt.
Vic is a new addition to the lore. (Garfield's father wasn't present in the many media iterations, save for a few passing mentions.) He abandoned Garfield as a kitten in an alley, and their relationship is strained. This Garfield, aside from the predictable references here and there to his gluttony, is mostly an agitated son who chafes at his dad's sudden presence in his life.
Even before all of this is set in motion, Garfield is introduced with too much pep in his step by Pratt, who has become, for better or worse, blockbuster animation's go-to lead ("The Lego Movie," "Onward," "The Super Mario Bros. Movie"). His voice acting, though, lacks the dynamism to embody a memorable character like Garfield. His golden retriever, himbo energy can work in specific situations, like "The Lego Movie," but here it's the inverse of what Garfield ought to be. Bill Murray, Garfield's voice in the earlier films, felt genuinely well suited to the cat's languor, even if the movies were rough.
Granted, Pratt isn't helped along elsewhere. The animation is visually flat, with compositions that seem oddly half-populated and cheap. The script, by Paul A. Kaplan, Mark Torgove and David Reynolds, is weak, with most of its comedy derived from cheap slapstick violence that even kids may tire of, and emotional beats that were written on autopilot.
This is all the more disappointing considering that in 2000, Dindal directed one of the more comically daring big-budget animated works: Disney's "The Emperor's New Groove." That film opened with a fourth-wall-breaking introduction from its protagonist, just as in this "Garfield"; in "The Emperor's New Groove," it foreshadowed the tone of an idiosyncratic work, but here it just reads as lazy.
More cynical viewers might see the film as simply a flotation device for ads, considering the constant product placement. In all his indolence, even Garfield would have dragged himself up to change the channel.

Sony Team Takes Step In Courting Paramount: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The two companies have expressed interest in acquiring the media conglomerate, but are backing away from their $ 26 billion all-cash offer.
Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management have taken a significant step forward in their effort to court Paramount, three people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The two companies have signed nondisclosure agreements with Paramount, allowing them to look at Paramount's nonpublic financial information, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss active negotiations. Paramount previously shared materials with another suitor, the Hollywood studio Skydance.
Early this month, Sony and Apollo sent Paramount a nonbinding expression of interest in acquiring the company for $ 26 billion. The two had been seeking to buy Paramount for its studio and then sell off other parts of its empire, which includes CBS, cable channels like MTV and the Paramount Plus streaming service.
But Sony's shareholders have fretted over the possible acquisition, given the potential cost of a bid for Paramount and the headwinds facing the subscription streaming business. Sony and Apollo are now contemplating a variety of approaches to acquire the company's assets, but are backing away from their plan to make an all-cash, $ 26 billion offer for Paramount, two of the people said.
Sony's new vision for a deal could alter the dynamics of Paramount's effort to sell itself or merge with another company. Paramount previously rebuffed Sony's offer to buy just its studio, and Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, has long sought a deal for the entire company.
A person familiar with Ms. Redstone's thinking has said that a breakup of the company is not a deal breaker, depending on the terms, but that she prefers to keep Paramount intact.
Ms. Redstone has blessed a deal to sell her stake in National Amusements, Paramount's parent company, to Skydance, but Skydance's bid for the entire company has faced significant pushback from Paramount's common shareholders.
Paramount let an exclusive negotiation window with Skydance lapse in recent weeks, but the two are still talking, and Skydance remains interested in a deal.
The deal talks are happening at a tumultuous time for Paramount. The company's chief executive, Bob Bakish, stepped down last month after more than a quarter-century at the company. He was replaced in the interim by three executives running an "office of the C.E.O.": George Cheeks, the chief executive of CBS; Chris McCarthy, the chairman of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios; and Brian Robbins, the chief executive of Paramount Pictures.

Full text: I'm a foreign correspondent covering China from Hong Kong. Much of what I've been watching and listening to is helping me rediscover Hong Kong, a city I was born and raised in, but left three decades ago when I was a teenager. Here are five things that I've enjoyed.
Anita
Before there was K-pop, there was Cantopop, and its queen was Anita Mui. This 2021 biopic follows one of Hong Kong's most beloved singers from her hardscrabble upbringing to international stardom. I remember in 2003 watching my hometown mourn Mui's death at the age of 40 from cervical cancer. It felt like a coda to an era.
Indelible City
Louisa Lim writes an ode to Hong Kong, digging into forgotten lore and rejecting the narratives imposed by its last two rulers, Britain and China. Like the author, I am Eurasian, and I spent much of my childhood in Hong Kong trying to navigate East and West, so this book felt deeply personal to me.
@majorcantotraits
TikTok hasn't been available in Hong Kong since China imposed a national security law. That makes Instagram the alternative for many. My go-to for shareable Hong Kong memes that none of my friends or family asked for is an anonymous account called Major Canto Traits. The owner pulls no punches, poking fun at locals, American-born Chinese and expatriates alike.
Heaven or Las Vegas
I discovered this 1990 Cocteau Twins album in middle school while rifling through my older sister's music. Dreamy guitars and synths serve as a backdrop to Elizabeth Fraser's otherworldly voice singing what can only be discerned as gibberish. Every time I listen to it, I'm back on the school bus in Hong Kong listening to my trusty Sony Discman.
MLB The Show 20
Playing an outdated video game with players who are no longer even in the big leagues seems like a strange flex. But something about the simpler interface and less-than-realistic graphics keeps bringing me back. Sinking into my sofa and playing this game allows me to switch my brain off and stop thinking about the China geopolitics beat.

'Jeopardy!' Plans to Stream a Pop-Culture Spinoff: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sony Pictures Television said that "Pop Culture Jeopardy!" -- which will pit teams of three against one another -- would be streamed on Prime Video.
"Jeopardy!" has long been ruled primarily by broadcast TV. As a staid, reliable quiz show that had the same host for 36 years, viewers have grown to depend on it at a certain time, on a certain channel.
But on Tuesday, Sony Pictures Television, which produces the show, announced a new spinoff -- a pop culture edition -- that will be streamed only on Prime Video. The spinoff, called "Pop Culture Jeopardy!," is part of a yearslong expansion of what the show's producers have called the "Jeopardy!"-verse, as they have pushed new spinoffs and tournaments to shake up the brand, while also avoiding any major changes to the main show that might rankle its most devoted fans.
The announcement about the new spinoff said contestants would compete in teams of three. Some of the topics that might come up, it said, include alternative rock music, "The Avengers," Broadway, mixed martial arts and high-profile celebrities such as Zendaya.
Under Michael Davies, who has been an executive producer of "Jeopardy!" since 2021, "Jeopardy!" has undergone a wave of expansion, featuring a new masters league with the show's most successful players, a Second Chance Tournament that invites back promising contestants and a revival of "Celebrity Jeopardy!"
It has not yet been announced who will host the pop-culture spinoff. Since the death of the show's longtime host, Alex Trebek, in 2020, the succession process has been somewhat tortured. The initial plan to promote the show's executive producer, Mike Richards, to host imploded after revelations that Richards had made offensive comments on a podcast. For a while, the actor Mayim Bialik split hosting duties with Ken Jennings, the show's former champion, until Bialik abruptly announced late last year that she had been removed, leaving Jennings as the sole host, at least for now.
"Jeopardy!" has had limited ventures into streaming before now. Viewers can stream some "Jeopardy!" episodes on Pluto TV, and the prime-time spinoffs stream on Hulu the day after they first air. The show used to have a sports trivia spinoff that could be found on Crackle, an online streaming service that never quite took off.

Big Firms Turn To Risky Type Of New Loan: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A little-known financial tool was the talk of the Milken Institute's Global Conference.
At the Milken Institute's Global Conference this week, a little-known risky financial tool became the subject of a hot debate among Wall Street titans.
Many private equity firms have quietly begun mortgaging their investment funds, piling leverage upon leverage. In other words, they're taking out loans against the businesses they've already taken out loans to buy.
At a time when dealmakers are desperate to raise new cash after the boom of the pandemic era, this mechanism -- known as a net asset value loan -- is allowing them to do it overnight.
More P.E. firms are using the tool as they set out to raise their next funds, especially those confronting a hurdle during a slow period for dealmaking: They have yet to return cash to the limited partners they tapped for their last round.
"We're having unprecedented pressure from our L.P.s to send them cash," Jonathan Sokoloff, a managing partner at the private equity firm Leonard Green, said onstage at the Milken conference. "We'll send you cash any way we can."
A spokeswoman for Leonard Green said the firm has never used any form of N.A.V. loan.
The big debate at Milken was whether private equity firms that are solving this problem with N.A.V.s are risking their future to buy some time with investors.
How N.A.V. loans work. Offered by banks and some smaller private credit-focused lenders, they are backed by the net asset value of select P.E. firms' investments. They have a higher interest rate than other forms of private equity lending, which appeals to lenders.
There is about $ 150 billion in N.A.V. facilities on the market today, according to the ratings agency S&P Global. It expects that figure to double in the next two years. Investor liquidity is only one use of the loans, which are often invested back into portfolio companies.
Lenders say they offer the loans cautiously. "When we come and lend to the portfolio, the fund will be in Year 4 or 5," Pierre-Antoine de Selancy, a co-founder of the private equity financing firm 17Capital, told DealBook. "We have a very good source of information."
Lenders and advisers who work on N.A.V. loans say they are generally structured to minimize risk, with short durations of two or three years and a low loan-to-value ratio, a measure that compares an asset's estimated value with the size of the loan. Loans against diversified assets can be safer than ones against an individual company because the risk is spread. That can also mean better loan terms.
But the danger is leveraging an illiquid asset. The private equity business model relies on taking out debt against each of a fund's businesses. But N.A.V. loans are most often borrowing against a group of businesses. That diversifies the risk, but it could effectively mean using a good business to help prop up a bad one, while also adding increasingly expensive leverage to an already leveraged fund.
"It introduces a greater degree of risk," Patricia Lynch, who leads the securitization practice at the law firm Ropes & Gray, told DealBook.
The quality of these loans depends in part on a private equity firm's ability to accurately calculate the value of its businesses (often with the stamp of a third-party appraiser). If the loans sour, it is not fast or easy to sell those assets.
Limited partners have limited recourse. Many of their agreements with private equity firms were written before N.A.V. loans were in vogue, which means these loans may be technically allowed, if not explicitly. But executives at several large pension funds who spoke to DealBook on the condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to comment on behalf of their firms, said they had told P.E. firms that they had concerns about using N.A.V. loans for distributions. Others, like Neuberger Berman, take a measured approach.
"The general sentiment is: Why are you using them?" Liz Traxler, a managing director at Neuberger Berman, said. "If you have transparency on the usage, and that aligns with the L.P.s, things are probably going to be very positive."
The worst-case scenario -- that P.E. firms default on their N.A.V. loans -- may be unlikely, but it is an untested risk that could hurt the very investors whom private equity firms are trying to appease in the first place. As Anne-Marie Fink, the chief investment officer of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, put it onstage at Milken: "If I get a little bit back now, but you've levered the whole fund and I'm cross-collateralized all through a N.A.V. loan, and I eventually lose my money, that's not a good way for me to get my money back." -- Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
TikTok sued to block a law that could force its sale. The company argues that the recently passed law -- which requires the app to split from ByteDance, its Chinese owner, or face a ban -- violates the First Amendment by effectively killing in the United States an app that millions of Americans use to share their views. The heart of the case is lawmakers' intent to defend the nation from what they and some experts say is a security threat.
FTX said it planned to repay all its customers. It will base their reimbursement on what they were owed as of November 2022, when the cryptocurrency exchange filed for bankruptcy, plus interest. The customers won't benefit from the huge jump in crypto prices since then.
More drama unfolded around a Paramount deal. If Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management succeed in the $ 26 billion acquisition they've expressed interest in, they plan to break up the media empire, DealBook's Lauren Hirsch and The New York Times's Ben Mullin reported. In other potential breakup news, T-Mobile and Verizon are said to be in talks that would divvy up U.S. Cellular, according to The Wall Street Journal.
U.S. authorities are reportedly examining Tesla's claims about its Autopilot feature. The inquiry by federal prosecutors centers on whether Elon Musk's electric carmaker committed securities or wire fraud by suggesting its cars can drive themselves, when its systems require human supervision, according to Reuters. It may again raise the question: Is it fraud, or is it puffery?
'Fun-flation,' Taylor's version
Europe has finally gotten in on Taylor Swift's record-breaking Eras Tour -- and the economic bonanza that seems to come with it.
The billion-dollar tour began in Europe on Thursday in Paris's 40,000-seat La Défense arena, before moving on to Stockholm, London, Amsterdam and other major cities through August.
Swift's shows appear to have inspired tourists to hit Europe. Americans who missed out last summer at home are taking advantage of a strong dollar, with tickets costing less on the other side of the Atlantic.
Airbnb rentals are up in the cities hosting concerts. Airbtics, which tracks data on Airbnb rentals, found a sharp uptick in bookings for several European stops on the Eras Tour. In Paris, rental occupancy jumped to nearly 100 percent on Thursday, up from 73 percent a week earlier. Milan, Munich, Vienna and Warsaw saw similar patterns, according to Airbtics. When European tickets went on sale in July, searches for Airbnb rentals in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Liverpool during concert dates increased an average 337 percent for show nights, compared with searches for those dates the previous month, according to Airbnb.
Some economists expect the Eras Tour to be the first boost for a busy European summer of events. Holger Schmieding, the Berenberg economist who coined the term "fun-flation" to describe how consumers were splashing out despite high inflation last year, predicts the trend will continue in Europe in 2024. Swift's tour is one of several big events on the continent, including the UEFA European soccer championship, which starts in Germany next month, and the Summer Olympics, which open in Paris in July.
Households in Europe may have even more spending firepower than last year. Food and fuel inflation is moderating more rapidly than in the United States, and interest rates could start coming down as soon as next month. "This summer, we will in Europe have significant further gains in the purchasing power of consumers," Schmieding told DealBook.
What the NFT boom (and bust) says about the dark side of the art market
Remember NFTs? Briefly during the pandemic, the nonfungible tokens generated countless headlines and billions in sales. Now, while other crypto assets are soaring, that market is down to mere millions, and former President Donald Trump is using NFTs to raise campaign funds. But the boom illuminated dark corners of the art market and economy, the Times reporter Zachary Small writes in "Token Supremacy: The Art of Finance, the Finance of Art, and the Great Crypto Crash of 2022." DealBook spoke with Small about the upcoming book.
What did the emergence of NFTs reveal about the art market?
They shed light onto the speculation and laundering that happen in the art market all the time. Sales of NFTs are recorded through the blockchain, so we could see prices in real time as they were changing and deduce what was happening. There was a lot of wash trading, where someone had set up two wallets under different signatures and was trading back and forth to elevate the price of a work until some unsuspecting rube bought into it because they thought it was doing well. Some experts and analysts say that ended up being a significant portion of the market.
So should the art market be regulated more like the stock market?
The art market is often referred to as the largest unregulated market in the world. You have paintings trading for hundreds of millions of dollars. But the Bank Secrecy Act does not apply, so it's very easy to use shell companies. Buyers don't know sellers. Oligarchs have been very successful in using art advisers as patsies and in moving money. But federal regulators have a fundamental difficulty with the art market because it doesn't seem serious. How do you put a price on art, and who cares? It's a champagne problem for billionaires.
NFTs adopted a very similar approach. It's a genius approach to create things that look ridiculous so regulators feel they don't really need to step in. From my reporting, that's a very deliberate strategy on the part of companies and investors to avoid regulation, and it's worked.
What does the NFT boom tell us about the future?
What's most urgent to me is that if you want to know how the 20- and 30-year-olds think about the economy, you need to know what they were doing in the NFT and crypto world. I think this acceptance of volatility and speculation as we've all lived through the interest rates changing and inflation and all the other economic red flags, it creates a system where speculation and volatility are more accepted. It makes it harder for regulators to safeguard the system.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Sony Team Is Planning To Break Up Paramount: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: CBS and other well-known properties would be sold if Sony and Apollo were able to buy Paramount. But the new owners would keep the movie studio.
Shari Redstone helped build Paramount Global into a media empire, but if Sony Pictures Entertainment and the private-equity giant Apollo Global Management succeed in acquiring it, they plan to break it all up, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The plan would include auctioning off CBS, cable channels like MTV and the Paramount Plus streaming service, said the people, who asked not to be identified sharing private details. Paramount Pictures -- home to blockbusters like "The Godfather," "Top Gun" and the "Mission: Impossible" franchise -- would be combined with Sony's business.
Sony and Apollo, which made a nonbinding expression of interest in acquiring Paramount for $ 26 billion last week, are also likely to keep Paramount's library of films and TV shows and the rights to well-known characters, including the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and SpongeBob SquarePants. They have not yet outlined this plan to Paramount or its advisers.
A breakup of Paramount would represent a major changing of the guard in the entertainment industry. CBS and Paramount have been controlled by the Redstone family for decades, since the media mogul Sumner Redstone assembled the conglomerate in a series of audacious deals. His daughter, Ms. Redstone, championed a 2019 deal to reunite it, and she remains Paramount's controlling shareholder.
Sony and Apollo are now engaging with Paramount's financial advisers on next steps in their proposal, the people said. The two companies have not yet signed formal nondisclosure agreements or begun due diligence reviews, a process that could take weeks.
Though it's still early, the two bidders have already begun to envision how a deal for Paramount could unfold. The two would likely operate the company as a joint venture controlled by Sony, with a minority stake owned by Apollo, the people said. Sony would look to combine the marketing and distribution functions of the Paramount movie studio with its own operations, and divest the rest of the properties.
Over time, Apollo could sell its stake in the joint venture back to Sony or to another buyer. It's not yet clear just how large a stake Apollo would hold in the business, though the company plans to invest billions in the deal, one person said.
A breakup of Paramount is not a preferred outcome for Ms. Redstone, who would prefer the company to pass on to another buyer intact, a person familiar with her thinking said. But it wouldn't necessarily be a dealbreaker if the offer was compelling, the person said.
There are other suitors. Skydance, a media company founded by the tech scion David Ellison, has been in discussions with Paramount for months about a potential deal. Exclusive negotiations between Skydance and Paramount lapsed last week, shortly after Sony and Apollo put in their expression of interest. But Skydance remains interested.
Sony and Paramount have different approaches to the entertainment business, and a deal would probably result in a U-turn for Paramount. Unlike Paramount, which streams its content on Paramount+, Sony licenses its movies and TV shows to companies like Netflix and Disney. Sony would probably not change that approach in a deal with Paramount and would most likely look to combine Paramount+ with a rival service, such as Comcast's Peacock or Warner Bros. Discovery's Max.
Sony has long pursued Paramount's movie studio. Several years ago, Sony executives reached out to Paramount to see if the company would be willing to sell Paramount Pictures or merge it into a joint venture, but Paramount signaled it was interested only in a deal for the whole company. So when Apollo made a bid for all of Paramount this year, Sony decided to team up.
Any deal by Sony would face regulatory hurdles. Regulations restrict foreign owners from holding licenses for U.S. broadcast stations, which could prevent Sony -- which is owned by the Japanese-based Sony Group -- from owning CBS-affiliated TV stations. But they could divest the stations immediately, or have Apollo apply for the license. They are also considering other options for the stations.
The deal would also most likely require clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the panel in Washington that scrutinizes acquisitions by foreign owners.
Sony and Apollo believe that when they decide to sell the Paramount assets, there could be many logical buyers, the three sources said. Warner Bros. Discovery, which does not own a broadcast network, could be a suitor for CBS. TV station groups like Nexstar and Tegna could be logical buyers for CBS's owned and operated TV stations.
The hardest asset to sell would most likely be Paramount's cable networks, like MTV and Nickelodeon, but those could be sold to a TV programmer looking for greater scale in negotiations with cable companies like Charter and Comcast.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Imagine being assigned to capture a historic event -- the first time a former U.S. president is criminally prosecuted -- and then being told you have just 45 seconds to do it. That's what photographers are faced with every day when covering former President Donald J. Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan.
The trial, now in its fourth week, has been a news media frenzy since proceedings began on Monday, April 15. Mr. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, all of which stem from a hush-money payment made to Stormy Daniels, a porn star, who took the stand on Tuesday and will continue her testimony today.
The New York Times has reporters covering the case from inside and outside of the courthouse in Lower Manhattan; their dispatches populate The Times's live blog on the trial. Because the court does not allow cameras during the proceedings (and the case is not being televised), five photographers, part of a rotation representing 10 news organizations, are allowed in the court each day by Justice Juan M. Merchan, just before the proceedings begin. The photographers step into the well of the court, between the judge's bench and the defendant's table, and for 45 seconds, the courtroom belongs to them.
Their subject: the former president of the United States.
According to Doug Mills, a Times veteran, Mr. Trump is "extremely serious" during the photography window. Mr. Mills is one of the 10 photographers who "pool" their work together for the use of multiple news outlets. (The Times has a photographer in the "pool" twice a week. Mr. Mills calls the assignment an honor.) In email exchanges, Mr. Mills shared insights from inside the courtroom, where he photographed Mr. Trump last week.
Mr. Trump is "always looking directly into photographers' lenses," Mr. Mills wrote. "He makes a point of making eye contact with the lenses."
According to Mr. Mills, the short amount of time isn't the only limitation. The photographers are allowed to work only in the small space in front of the table, which is about 12 feet long. So they get creative, using a variety of lenses and taking different angles, as Mr. Mills did on Friday.
"I put my Sony camera on a monopod with an electronic remote and extended it high in the air, about 12 to 14 feet, and then took photos from a bird's-eye view using a 24 mm lens," he wrote.
The photographers are also permitted to shoot in the hallway, capturing Mr. Trump's "comings and goings during each break and lunch break," Mr. Mills added.
Mr. Mills, who has covered every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan and has worked for The Times since 2002, is assigned to the White House, so he is used to working under restrictions. But 45 seconds?
"I've been in the business for over 40 years; this is very different and very historic," he wrote.
For Mr. Mills, the brief time span is enough to get roughly 120 images -- his camera can take 10 frames per second. And a certain irony is not lost on him.
"It's ironic that we get 45 seconds for the 45th president, it goes very fast."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street has been debating how the investment giant's $ 59 billion real estate fund has managed to outperform virtually all its rivals.
The numbers behind a big fund
On Wall Street, one mystery has been whispered about for months: How accurate is the valuation of Blackstone's flagship real estate fund?
The speculation has arisen because the fund, the $ 59 billion Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust -- more commonly known as BREIT -- has managed to keep an "appraised" value of its assets that far exceeds virtually every other real estate fund. Many rivals have fallen in value, some quite dramatically, in the face of high interest rates and a flagging property market.
BREIT's performance has floated above its competition, and it has boasted a 10.5 percent annual return since its 2017 debut.
The debate over the fund's impressive performance has taken on greater significance, and the criticism has grown louder, because of how Blackstone determines the appraised value of its assets, DealBook's Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael de la Merced report. Many major firms rely on a third-party appraiser to determine the worth of a fund's assets, in part so investors can trust that the appraised value is accurate and not unduly influenced by the firms. (Those appraisals help to determine a firm's management fees: The higher the appraisal value, the higher the fees.)
Blackstone appears to do it differently. While it uses a third-party appraiser and an outside auditor, the firm has the final say on the appraised value of its own assets.
Blackstone is open about its approach. From a recent prospectus:
"These assumptions are determined by the Adviser, and reviewed by our independent valuation advisor."
While Blackstone discloses how it determines the final valuation, some on Wall Street have questioned how much latitude firms should have in appraising their own assets.
Blackstone says that its assets are strenuously assessed. "Our process requires us to use monthly property valuations that have been assured by a third-party; we have never overridden these in BREIT's history," the firm told DealBook in a statement.
It added, "We stand by our rigorous valuation process, which is virtually identical to the one we use for our open-ended, institutional vehicles and has been validated by $ 20 billion of assets sold at a premium to N.A.V. since 2022."
Blackstone has contended that its appraisal approach is more conservative than its competitors'. It also argues that its appraisal process is better than a third-party appraiser because, as one of the nation's biggest real estate owners, Blackstone has better data and can move faster to mark assets up or down. (Third-party appraisers often use delayed data.)
Blackstone also says that its portfolio of real estate assets is of a higher quality than its competitors, and includes high-growth sectors such as data centers and student housing.
To underscore that point, Blackstone noted that it had sold assets for higher values, including stakes in two Las Vegas casinos, self-storage warehouses and most recently student housing -- all at a profit.
The fund also hasn't meaningfully sold assets in the biggest part of its portfolio, apartment buildings and industrial facilities, according to Matthew Werner, a managing director of REIT strategies at Chilton Capital Management, an asset management firm. (Blackstone has said BREIT's properties in those sectors are performing well.)
Wall Street is split on Blackstone's approach. Craig McCann, the president of the financial consulting firm SLCG Economic Consulting who has written several blog posts criticizing the fund, said flatly, "We think there's something wrong."
Others are more sanguine. Kevin Gannon, the C.E.O. of Robert A. Stanger, an investment bank that tracks REITs, told DealBook that while his firm has regularly observed that BREIT's valuations have topped its peers, its calculations appear in line with broader industry trends.
"We don't find fault with the N.A.V.," Gannon said. "Would I be overly concerned? No."
But BREIT may be tested in the next year. The fund has already survived a huge blow: Starting in late 2022, worried investors began to demand their money back. Because of how BREIT is structured, Blackstone was able to return that cash gradually, a way to avoid a torrent of outflows that would force the fund to sell assets at cut-rate prices.
The firm's leaders acknowledge that investors are worried about the commercial real estate sector. Indeed, other REITs also saw redemptions, according to Gannon.
Blackstone has said that BREIT is a big part of its future. The real estate fund has both added to the firm's assets -- which now total more than $ 1 trillion -- and contributed $ 839.9 million in net management and advisory fees last year alone. The fund's success has been a factor in Blackstone's ascendant stock price: Shares in Blackstone have tripled in the past five years, closing on Monday at $ 121.22.
Analysts and investors are watching with great interest because Blackstone is rolling out a new, similarly designed fund that invests in private equity assets. If successful, it could pave the way for even more funds to follow the BREIT formula.
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
The Israeli military sends tanks into Rafah. Israel also took control of the Gaza side of the city's border crossing with Egypt, but it wasn't the long-awaited full-scale invasion that the government had threatened. The military operation came after Hamas agreed to a cease-fire plan proposed by Egypt and Qatar, but one that Israel said it hadn't supported.
The F.A.A. opens a new investigation of Boeing over 787 Dreamliner inspections. The inquiry began after the plane maker said that it might have skipped required inspections for the wings of the aircraft. It's the latest bad news for Boeing, already under scrutiny on its 737 Max 8 planes. Separately, Boeing postponed the first launch of its Starliner spacecraft, which was supposed to carry two astronauts to and from the International Space Station.
Conservative judges say they'll blacklist Columbia students from clerkships. A group of 13 judges called the university an "incubator of bigotry," citing the pro-Palestinian protests that have rocked the school for weeks. Columbia canceled its main commencement ceremony, citing security concerns, while the police clashed with protesters at M.I.T. and several California schools.
Disney+ becomes profitable ahead of schedule. Disney's streaming service reported a $ 47 million profit for the first quarter, after company executives had predicted the platform would only stop losing money in the fall. That helped the entertainment giant beat analysts' expectations for overall earnings per share by 10 percent.
Musk and media deals at Milken
A mix of celebrities, politicians and financiers were out in force on the first full day of the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles.
The hot ticket: Elon Musk's conversation with Michael Milken. The big topics: how private equity can return capital to investors as deal making dries up, and the sale of Paramount, DealBook's Lauren Hirsch reports from the event.
Everyone wanted to hear from Musk. Days after a quick and unexpected trip to China, Tesla's C.E.O. chatted about a range of topics, including artificial intelligence, space, regulation and what keeps him up at night ("Civilizational risks" like falling birthrates, he said).
Dozens of attendees lined up to see the panel, forcing others to settle for an overflow room -- which also filled up.
Everyone in private equity is talking about "D.P.I." Short for "distribution to paid-in capital," which tracks a fund's returns to its investors, the discussion reflects how industry executives are trying to get money back to their investors, after raising record amounts of funds. Among the options: selling a partial stake or taking out loans against their funds' net asset value.
But not everyone is keen on the ideas. Anne-Marie Fink, who oversees private equity investments for the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, said on a panel that there was no system for assessing liquidity if part of a business gets sold. "What worries me is that we haven't really developed the mechanisms such that if you sell off 70 percent of my business, now you're 30 percent owner," she said. "How do I get liquidity on that 30?"
There's lots of buzz about what happens to Paramount. The media company, whose studio is only a 20-minute drive from the conference site, is weighing takeover bids, one from David Ellison's Skydance and another from Sony and the private equity giant Apollo Global Management.
One media deal maker who appears to be sitting out the fight (for now): David Zaslav, the C.E.O. of Warner Bros. Discovery, who suggested on a panel that he wasn't interested in joining the bidding. Zaslav is close to Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder, and expressed interest in a merger in December. But on Monday he said only that however the fight ends, "I hope that they're successful."
Money and the Met Gala
Anna Wintour's Met Gala once again brought together the biggest names in business, fashion, film, sports, entertainment and tech as companies and celebrities flexed the power of their brands.
The event is, unofficially, the party of the year held to raise money for the museum's fashion unit. The gala on Monday was partly sponsored by TikTok, giving the embattled company's C.E.O., Shou Chew, a starring role as chair of the party -- a reprieve from the bad headlines for the company after President Biden signed a law threatening to ban the short-video app.
The amount TikTok paid for the role wasn't disclosed, but DealBook took a look at the gala and its history by the numbers to get a sense of the money behind it.
$ 350,000: The starting cost for a company to snag a table. But paying up might not be enough to guarantee a seat: Wintour, the global editorial director of the publisher Condé Nast, approves all guests.
$ 75,000: The price of an individual ticket this year, up from $ 50,000 in 2023.
$ 3.3 million: Total wage increases promised to members of the Condé Nast union, who had threatened to disrupt the party before a deal was reached on Monday.
$ 995 million: The "media impact value" the event generated for Vogue in 2023, per the fashion data firm LaunchMetrics.
$ 22 million: Amount raised at the Met Gala last year. The spike in ticket prices this year means a bigger intake is expected.

Facing Labor Shortages, Japan Moves to Advance Working Women: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Employers have taken steps to change a male-dominated workplace culture. But women still struggle to balance their careers with domestic obligations.
When the future empress of Japan entered the country's elite diplomatic corps in 1987, a year after a major equal employment law went into effect, she was one of only three female recruits. Known then as Masako Owada, she worked long hours and had a rising career as a trade negotiator. But she lasted just under six years in the job, giving it up to marry Crown Prince -- and now Emperor -- Naruhito.
Much has changed for Japan's Foreign Ministry -- and, in some ways, for Japanese women more broadly -- in the ensuing three decades.
Since 2020, women have comprised nearly half of each entering class of diplomats, and many women continue their careers after they marry. These advances, in a country where women were predominantly hired only for clerical positions into the 1980s, show how the simple power of numbers can, however slowly, begin to remake workplace cultures and create a pipeline for leadership.
For years, Japan has promoted women in the workplace to aid its sputtering economy. Private-sector employers have taken some steps, like encouraging male employees to do more around the house, or setting limits on after-work outings that can complicate child care. But many women still struggle to balance their careers with domestic obligations.
The Foreign Ministry, led by a woman, Yoko Kamikawa, exceeds both other government agencies and familiar corporate names like Mitsubishi, Panasonic and SoftBank in an important sign of progress: its placement of women in career-track, professional jobs.
With more women in the ministry's ranks, said Kotono Hara, a diplomat, "the way of working is drastically changing," with more flexible hours and the option to work remotely.
Ms. Hara was one of only six women who joined the ministry in 2005. Last year, she was the event manager for a meeting of world leaders that Japan hosted in Hiroshima.
In the run-up to the Group of 7 summit, she worked in the office until 6:30 p.m. and then went home to feed and bathe her preschool-age child, before checking in with her team online later in the night. Earlier in her career, she assumed such a job was not the "kind of position that would be done by a mommy."
Some of the progress for women at the Foreign Ministry has come as men from elite universities have turned instead to high-paying banking and consulting jobs, and educated women have come to see the public sector as appealing.
Yet as women move up in the diplomatic corps, they -- like their counterparts at other employers -- must juggle long working hours on top of shouldering the bulk of the duties on the home front.
Ministry staff members often work until 9 or 10 at night, and sometimes much later. Those hours tend to fall more heavily on women, said Shiori Kusuda, 29, who joined the ministry seven years ago and departed earlier this year for a consulting job in Tokyo.
Many of her male bosses at the Foreign Ministry, she said, went home to wives who took care of their meals and laundry, while her female colleagues completed domestic chores themselves. Men are encouraged to take paternity leave, but if they do, it is usually a matter of days or weeks.
Some parts of the culture have changed, Ms. Kusuda said -- male colleagues proactively served her beer at after-work drinking sessions, rather than expecting her to serve them. But for women "who need to do their laundry or cooking after they go home, one hour of overtime work matters a lot," Ms. Kusuda said.
In 2021, the latest year for which government statistics are available, married working women with children took on more than three-quarters of household chores. That load is compounded by the fact that Japanese employees, on average, work nearly 22 hours of overtime a month, according to a survey last year by Doda, a job-hunting website.
In many professions, additional hours are much higher, a reality that prompted the government to recently cap overtime at 45 hours a month.
Before the Equal Opportunity Employment Act went into effect in 1986, women were mostly hired for "ochakumi," or "tea-serving," jobs. Employers rarely recruited women for positions that could lead to executive, managerial or sales jobs.
Today, Japan is turning to women to cope with severe labor shortages. Still, while more than 80 percent of women ages 25 to 54 work, they account for just slightly more than a quarter of full-time, permanent employees. Only about one in eight managers are women, according to government data.
Some executives say women simply choose to limit their careers. Japanese women are "not as ambitious compared to women in the global market," said Tetsu Yamaguchi, the director of global human resources for Fast Retailing, the clothing giant that owns Uniqlo. "Their priority is taking care of their child rather than developing their career."
Worldwide, 45 percent of the company's managers are women. In Japan, that proportion is just over a quarter.
Experts say the onus is on employers to make it easier for women to combine professional success and motherhood. Career barriers for women could hurt the broader economy, and as the nation's birthrate dwindles, crushing expectations at work and at home can discourage ambitious women from having children.
At Sony, just one in nine of its managers in Japan are women. The company is taking small measures to support working mothers, such as offering courses for prospective fathers in which they are taught to change diapers and feed infants.
During a recent class at the company's Tokyo headquarters, Satoko Sasaki, 35, who was seven months pregnant, watched her husband, Yudai, 29, a Sony software engineer, strap on a prosthetic belly simulating the physical sensations of pregnancy.
Ms. Sasaki, who works as an administrator at another company in Tokyo, said she was moved that her husband's employer was trying to help men "understand my situation."
At her own company, she said, tearing up, "I don't have much support" from senior male colleagues.
Takayuki Kosaka, the course instructor, displayed a graph showing the time invested at home by a typical mother and father during the first 100 days of an infant's life.
"The dad isn't doing anything!" said Mr. Kosaka, pointing at a blue bar representing the father's time working from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. "If he's coming home at 11 p.m., doesn't that mean that he also went out drinking?" he added.
After-work drinking parties with colleagues are all but obligatory at many Japanese companies, exacerbating the overwork culture. To curtail such commitments, Itochu, a conglomerate that owns the convenience store chain Family Mart among other businesses, mandates that all such parties end by 10 p.m. -- still a time that makes child care difficult.
Rina Onishi, 24, who works at Itochu's Tokyo headquarters, said she attended such parties three times a week. That is progress, she said: In the past, there were many more.
Drinking nights come on top of long days. The company now allows staff members to start working as early as 5 a.m., a policy intended in part to support parents who want to leave earlier. But many employees still work overtime. Ms. Onishi arrives at the office by 7:30 a.m. and typically stays until after 6 p.m.
Some women set limits on their work hours, even if it means forgoing promotions. Maiko Itagaki, 48, labored at a punishing pace as an advertising copywriter before landing in the hospital with a cerebral hemorrhage. After recovering, she married and gave birth to a son. But she was at the office when her mother called to tell her she had missed her son's first steps.
"I thought, 'Why am I working?"' Ms. Itagaki said.
She moved to a firm that conducts direct mail campaigns where she clocks in at 9 a.m. and out at 6 p.m. She declined a promotion to management. "I thought I would end up sacrificing my private time," she said. "It felt like they just wanted me to do everything."
At the Foreign Ministry, Hikariko Ono, Japan's ambassador to Hungary, was the only woman out of 26 diplomats hired in 1988.
She postponed having a child out of fear that her bosses would think she did not take her career seriously. These days, she reminds younger female colleagues that if they want to have children, they are not alone.
"You can rely on the day-care center or your parents or friends," she said. "Or even, of course, your husband."

Laurent Cantet, an eminent director who made penetrating films about the prickly undersides of French life and society, died on April 25 in Paris. He was 63.
His screenwriter and editor, Robin Campillo, said he died of cancer in a hospital.
Mr. Cantet's best-known film was "Entre les Murs" ("The Class"), which won the Palme d'Or, the Cannes Film Festival's top prize, in 2008 and was nominated for an Oscar as best foreign-language film. "The Class" was something new in French filmmaking: an extended snapshot of the inside of a schoolroom in a working-class district of Paris, using a real-life former teacher and real-life schoolchildren and treading a provocative line between documentary and fiction.
That ambiguity infuses the film with a rare tension, as a hapless language teacher struggles with his largely immigrant students, trying (with difficulty) to gain their acceptance of the strict rules of the French language and French identity. In this frank chronicle of classroom life, the students, many of them from Africa, the Caribbean and Asia -- bright, sometimes provocative -- have the upper hand.
Along the way, Mr. Cantet surgically exposes the fault lines in France's faltering attempts at integration, showing exactly where the country's rigid model is often impervious to the experience of its non-native citizens. Reviewing "The Class" in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called it "artful, intelligent" and "urgently necessary."
The film touched a nerve in France, selling more than a million tickets. Right-leaning intellectuals like Alain Finkielkraut denounced it for devaluing classical French culture -- unwittingly underscoring Mr. Cantet's point.
Mr. Cantet was invited to the Élysée Palace to discuss the film with President Nicolas Sarkozy. He declined the invitation. "I'm not going to speak about diversity with someone who invented the Ministry of National Identity," Mr. Cantet said at the time, referring to one of Mr. Sarkozy's more ill-fated initiatives.
That film, and a handful of others in Mr. Cantet's foreshortened career -- "Ressources Humaines" ("Human Resources"), "L'Emploi du Temps" ("Time Out"), "Vers le Sud" ("Heading South") -- were concerned with the alienation of those caught in inescapable modern-life traps under late-stage capitalism.
The tense, uneasy "Human Resources," released in 1999, put a business-school graduate in a human resources internship at the factory where his blue-collar father is to be laid off. Two years later, "Time Out" depicted a jobless white-collar worker who covers up his shameful unemployment with disastrous results.
In the disturbing "Heading South," based on a novel by the Haitian-Canadian author Dany Lafèrriere and released in 2005, Charlotte Rampling gave a bravura performance as the principal among a group of aging sex tourists in Haiti. Reviewing it in The Times, Stephen Holden praised it as "devastating."
"Mr. Cantet's film is too sophisticated to demonize these women, whose relationships with their young lovers are more tender and nourishing than overtly crass," Mr. Holden wrote.
In an email message, Ms. Rampling wrote: "All the locations were outside, and the weather was so unpredictable that we were never sure from one day to the next if we could shoot or how we would proceed. We kept stopping and starting, giving rise to great tension and anxiety in Laurent throughout the filming."
The film, she added, "is flawed, but it is still a fine piece of work from an honorable and good man."
In these films, as in "The Class," Mr. Cantet called into question the basic arrangements that form the texture of modern life. What interested him in "The Class," he told the newspaper Libération in 2008, were "the moments where the class transforms itself into a school for democracy, and, sometimes, into a school for school itself. What are we doing here? Why are we here at all?"
A soft-spoken filmmaker who hung back and listened and who was uninterested in the glitz of moviemaking, Mr. Cantet was haunted by the last two questions, in a classic French tradition stretching back through Camus and Montaigne.
Mr. Campillo, who was a screenwriter and editor on all of Mr. Cantet's major films, said the director's predilection for nonprofessional actors "wasn't just about naturalism."
"It was to work with people who, through cinema, discovered something about themselves," he said. Mr. Cantet, he added, was "very modest. He put himself on the same level as his crew."
In an interview with the French film critic Michel Ciment after he won the Palme d'Or, Mr. Cantet described the quasi-improvisational method he developed for "The Class," in which the teacher, the film's central figure, was played by the author of the novel on which the movie is based.
"I drew up a minimum of dialogue, to indicate the energy we needed, the attitude of each person," he said. "At the beginning of each scene, I gave them guideposts, so they had something staked out to work with, and then we went to work with something much more constructed."
Ms. Dargis reported that the shoot lasted a full academic year.
"What we tried to do is construct the film along the lines of this paradox: Is it a documentary? Is it a fiction?" Mr. Cantet told Mr. Ciment.
Among the films Mr. Cantet made after "The Class" were "Foxfire: Confessions of a Girl Gang" (2013), a tale of proto-feminist revolt based on a Joyce Carol Oates novel; "L'Atelier" ("The Workshop"), from 2017, about a writing workshop in the south of France, in which he again dealt with France's social fractures; and "Arthur Rambo" (2021), about the self-destruction of a promising young man from the immigrant suburbs.
Laurent Cantet was born on April 11, 1961, in the small town of Melle, in western France, and grew up in Niort, another town in that region. He traced his love of film to the monthly screenings organized by his father, Jean, at the school where his father and his mother, Madeleine (Ciach) Cantet, both taught.
Laurent graduated from the Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques in Paris in 1986, and before making his own films, he was an assistant on Marcel Ophuls's 1994 documentary about war correspondents, "The Troubles We've Seen."
One of Mr. Cantet's favorite quotations, his producer Caroline Benjo said in a tribute to him on the radio station France Culture, was from the director Jean Renoir: "Everyone is more or less right."
Mr. Cantet is survived by his wife, Isabelle (Coursin) Cantet; his daughter, Marie Cantet; his son, Félix; his father; and his brother, Philippe.
His films were what the French call "socially committed" without being didactic or ideological. His remarks about "The Class" could apply to his other films as well.
"I don't pretend to a documentary exactitude," he told Mr. Ciment. "The situation we are showing is very complex, and full of contradictions. There are no good guys and bad guys."

Questioning Whether Going Exclusive Is a Waste of Time: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The exclusive period for Paramount's potential merger with Skydance expired without a deal, highlighting the long-debated question of whether exclusivity is a waste of time.
Paramount's proposed merger with Skydance has been the most tumultuous media deal in years. Now it has taken yet another turn after the exclusivity period for negotiations expired without an agreement in hand.
A month ago, a special committee of Paramount's board agreed to enter into exclusive talks with Skydance -- a Hollywood studio run by the tech scion David Ellison -- even as the private equity giant Apollo Global Management reached out with a $ 26 billion offer. Paramount shareholders grumbled that granting exclusivity was a mistake, and that the company should have engaged with Apollo instead.
This week, the special committee told Skydance that it was letting the exclusivity period lapse. The end of exclusivity doesn't alone kill the deal with Skydance. But it does allow Paramount to open up negotiations with Apollo and Sony Pictures Entertainment, which joined Apollo's bid.
The so far fruitless negotiations raise a question that deal makers have long debated: Why do companies like Paramount agree to exclusivity in the first place?
Buyers often prefer exclusivity more than sellers. Exclusivity is a sign from the seller that it is committed to doing a deal and not just using a bid to drum up higher offers.
Sellers generally prefer to negotiate without exclusivity because it limits their ability to shop around for a higher price. And since they've already signaled to a buyer they're willing to make a deal, they've weakened their bargaining power.
Many big public company deals are negotiated without exclusivity, since shareholders expect the company to get the highest possible price.
Exclusivity can help sellers with thorny deals. In addition to helping to cajole a potential buyer to spend millions on due diligence, committing to negotiate with just one party can obscure limited interest.
"An auction is a really good way of selling something when you have multiple bidders," Edward Rock, a professor of corporate law at New York University told DealBook. "It's a really bad way of selling something if you announce an auction and only one person shows up, because now everybody knows there's no one else out there interested in buying the company."
For Paramount, other factors were most likely in play. Shari Redstone, the company's board chair, almost certainly prefers a Skydance deal, which would allow her to sell her shares at a control premium. It's unclear whether the all-cash Paramount offer from Sony and Apollo would be as lucrative for her.
Redstone appointed the special committee to lead Paramount's negotiations to avoid conflicts of interest. But that committee is nonetheless aware that Skydance's bid for National Amusements, the parent company of Paramount, was supported by Redstone, the company's most influential shareholder. That was likely a factor in its decision to move forward with exclusive talks, said Steven Davidoff Solomon, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.
Solomon said the special committee might have seen Skydance's offer as the only plausible deal on the table. "Let's see if we can get it done," Solomon said, articulating his interpretation of the committee's approach. "If we can't get it done, then 30 days later, we can go do another deal."
But time is money. The highly publicized 30-day deadline put a spotlight on the deal, adding an unwelcome level of dramatic tension as the two sides sought to hammer out a tricky agreement. The 30 days also coincided with the departure of Paramount's C.E.O., Bob Bakish, which left the company on shakier footing and potentially weakened its bargaining power.
If Paramount begins talks with Sony and Apollo, it's not clear they will result in a deal. It's not clear whether there will now be any deal at all. But in any case, Paramount's special committee will have a lot to talk about when it meets today to discuss its options. -- Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
The United States added fewer jobs than expected last month. Non-farm payrolls released this week showed that 175,000 jobs were created, fewer than forecast, and that wage growth slowed. The data capped a week of new economic indicators and the Fed's decision to leave rates unchanged until it is confident that inflation is closer to its 2 percent target.
The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Trump Media's auditor with fraud. The regulator charged BF Borgers with failing to comply with accounting rules, and the firm agreed to stop filing audited statements on behalf of clients. Trump Media has been a client of BF Borgers since 2022.
The Biden administration recommended reclassifying marijuana. Cannabis company stocks jumped on news that the Justice Department recommended changing the drug's classification from Schedule I (the same level as heroin) to Schedule III (which would put it on a par with Tylenol and codeine). The move could help President Biden's appeal among younger voters.
Another crypto mogul was sentenced to prison. Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance and one of the industry's biggest names, was given a term of four months for violating money laundering rules. Zhao, who pleaded guilty last year, received less than the three-year term that prosecutors had recommended. With a fortune estimated at $ 33 billion, he may become the richest federal inmate in U.S. history.
Munger's best zingers
Much of Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in Omaha today will resemble gatherings of years past: the tens of thousands of attendees from around the world; dozens of representatives from the conglomerate's portfolio companies, from Fruit of the Loom to the BNSF railroad; and Warren Buffett himself on hand to answer shareholder questions.
But this year Buffett will be without his longtime right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who died in November at age 99. For ages, the centerpiece of the shareholder conclave was an hourslong question-and-answer session featuring the two men, who perfected a buddy-comedy act -- Buffett first answered with sunny optimism, and then Munger followed with sharp-tongued cynicism. (This year, Buffett will be joined by his top lieutenants, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.)
Here are some of the best zingers that Munger let fly at Berkshire annual meetings over the years:
"If you mix the mathematics of the chain letter or the Ponzi scheme with some legitimate development like the development of the internet, you are mixing something which is wretched or irrational or has bad consequences with something that has very good consequences. But you know, if you mix raisins with turds, they're still turds." (2000)
"What I needed to get ahead was to compete against idiots. And luckily there's a large supply." (2014)
"I have avoided compensation consultants all my life. I hardly can find the words to express my contempt." (2017)
"A man who jumps out of a building is OK until he hits the ground." (2023, on government deficits)
On our radar: A.I. art that gives humans some hope
Ever since ChatGPT was released in 2022, businesses and governments have been trying to figure out how artificial intelligence will work alongside humans. Can the technology take on entire jobs? Is it a collaborator? And which functions could A.I. augment rather than replace?
For clues on the future, DealBook visited two art galleries in London featuring works created by traditional artists experimenting with A.I.
In "AI & Technology Influence on Contemporary Art," a show curated by Virginia Damtsa and on display through Sept. 10 at Gabriel Scott, three painters have used the tech to test the boundaries of human creativity, exploring whether A.I. is a liberating tool or an existential risk to creativity. Jonathan Yeo -- whose painting of King Charles III, the first since he was crowned, will be unveiled this month -- asked an A.I. to create a series of self-portraits. Von Wolfe, an oil painter, built his own A.I. to create an image of a digital sculpture that is displayed in a light box. And Henry Hudson asked an A.I. to create an image and then used oils to paint a version of it.
"Post-Photography: The Uncanny Valley," a show at the Palmer Gallery through May 17, also features the work of three artists. Boris Eldagsen of Germany won a Sony World Photographer Award last year -- and turned it down, after revealing that he had used A.I. to create his entry partly to kick-start a discussion about technology and art. The image, "The Electrician," and other works by Eldagsen are displayed alongside images by Ben Millar Cole, a British photographer, and Nouf Aljowaysir, a Saudi-born artist. It would be impossible for most viewers to know that the images were generated using tools like DALL-E, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.
The artists created the works by using A.I. as a tool, as if it were a paintbrush or a computer. For workers trying to understand how their own jobs will evolve, that could provide some hope that humans will have a role to play for a bit longer yet.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Bidding Group Led by Sony and Apollo in Negotiations to Acquire Paramount: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: After letting exclusive talks with the movie studio Skydance lapse, Paramount's directors met over the weekend and decided to negotiate with all the suitors.
Paramount has decided to formally open negotiations with a bidding group led by Sony Pictures Entertainment and the private equity giant Apollo, according to three people familiar with the matter. The move comes after a period of exclusive talks with the Hollywood studio Skydance lapsed on Friday night.
A special committee of Paramount's board of directors met Saturday and signed off on beginning deal talks with Sony and Apollo, which last week submitted a nonbinding letter of interest offering to buy the company for around $ 26 billion in cash, the people said. The committee also decided to push for further negotiations with Skydance, a studio founded by the technology scion David Ellison.
Paramount, the owner of Nickelodeon, MTV, CBS and Paramount Pictures, has been exploring a deal as it faces industrywide headwinds, including the decline of cable TV and the unprofitability of its streaming business.
Any deal between the Sony group and Paramount faces hurdles. Government regulations restrict foreign ownership of broadcast networks and could prevent Sony's parent company, based in Japan, from owning CBS outright. The bidding group would probably push for Apollo, which is based in the United States, to hold the rights to the CBS broadcast license, according to two people familiar with their strategy.
Government regulators have also aggressively evaluated acquisitions under President Biden, with the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission moving to block a number of proposed deals. Not all of those moves by regulators have been successful.
It also remains to be seen whether National Amusements, Paramount's parent company, will support the Sony-Apollo bid. National Amusements has the power to veto any deal, giving the new bidders an extra incentive to secure its approval, though National Amusements has committed to supporting the special committee's decision.
Sony and Apollo's all-cash offer has been supported by many shareholders as an alternate to a merger with Skydance. Late last year, Shari Redstone, who controls National Amusements, signed off on a potential deal to sell her stake to Skydance, but that deal hinges on a related transaction for Skydance to merge with Paramount. The deal stalled last week after the two sides were unable to reach an agreement after a month of exclusive negotiations. Shareholders were bearish on that deal, saying it would enrich Ms. Redstone at their expense.
Under the terms currently being contemplated in the Sony-Apollo tie-up, Sony would be a controlling shareholder, with Apollo owning a minority stake, according to the two people familiar with the bidders' strategy. Sony executives have discussed operating the Paramount studio as a division of their larger empire, uniting the studios behind the "Spider Man" and "Mission: Impossible" franchises and combining their theatrical marketing and distribution operations.
Though the finer points of the deal have yet to be detailed, Sony and Apollo have discussed putting Paramount -- which includes the Paramount+ streaming service and the CBS broadcast network -- into a joint venture, the two people said. One scenario under discussion is allowing Apollo to sell its minority stake back to Sony in a few years, allowing Sony to consolidate ownership of the company.
It is unclear what Skydance will do next. It sweetened its offer to Paramount last week, offering a $ 3 billion investment to buy back stock and pay down debt, but that extra incentive wasn't enough to get the deal across the finish line. Skydance could still improve its bid, but one person familiar with the company's strategy said it was unwilling to continue negotiating only to drive up the price for another suitor.
Paramount is still interested in a potential deal with Skydance and even offered to cover the company's legal fees, one person familiar with the matter said.
It's unclear how Sony and Paramount's approaches to the entertainment business would mesh. Paramount has opted to follow Netflix into the business of selling directly to subscribers, signing up more than 71 million paying customers globally. Sony has eschewed its own streaming business and instead sells TV shows to entertainment conglomerates like Netflix and Disney.
Paramount, meanwhile, is preparing for the possibility that both deals could fall apart. The company just replaced Bob Bakish, its chief executive, with an "office of the C.E.O." run by three division chiefs: Brian Robbins, chief executive of Paramount Pictures; Chris McCarthy, chief executive of Showtime and MTV Studios; and George Cheeks, the chief executive of CBS. They're preparing to unveil a new long-term plan for the company.
The company is also considering a streaming joint venture with an array of potential partners including Comcast, which operates the Peacock streaming service, one of the people said.

It Became Hollywood's Favorite Marketing Machine: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Insular, slow-changing Hollywood responded to TikTok's arrival in 2018 in typical fashion: complete dismissal. We're way too busy making pictures to worry about some new short-form video app.
Then came denial. (This thing is just another fad.) Next, fear. (Teenagers and young adults are never going to the movies again!)
But there's a plot twist: Hollywood has come to see TikTok as indispensable.
"Anyone But You," a Sony romantic comedy starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, arrived to a piddly $ 8 million in ticket sales over Christmas weekend. The movie turned into a full-fledged hit ( $ 219 million) after TikTok users (at the urging of Sony) began making videos of themselves re-enacting the credit sequence.
TikTok also served as a ticket-selling machine for "M3gan," a Universal-Blumhouse horror movie about a sassy robot that has spawned a new franchise; "Wonka," which debuted in December and collected $ 632 million; and the Barbenheimer box office phenomenon, otherwise known as "Barbie," with $ 1.4 billion, and "Oppenheimer," with about $ 1 billion. Rote glamour shots and insipid interviews -- ye olde studio publicity tools -- don't work on TikTok; users want behind-the-scenes "realness." Hence "Oppenheimer" stars goofing in a hotel hallway before a premiere, and pink-clad "Barbie" stars cavorting on the floor with puppies.
"Now that studios have figured out how to harness TikTok, the last thing they want is for it to go dark," said Sue Fleishman, a former Universal and Warner Bros. executive who is now a consultant. "That would actually be a big problem."
Fans posted dual reviews of "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer," an organic marketing boost.; Turning from "Oppenheimer" darks to "Barbie" pinks at the dual opening, a viral event.; Glen Powell, of "Anyone but You," made a TikTok that imitated fan-driven memes. This article appeared in print on page BU3.

Paramount's Exclusive Talks With Skydance Have Lapsed: [National Desk]

Full text: Negotiations are now likely to focus on another suitor, Sony, which has teamed up with the private equity giant Apollo on a $ 26 billion bid.
Paramount told Skydance that it would not extend the Hollywood studio's exclusive window to negotiate a merger, two people with knowledge of the decisions said Friday, imperiling the deal but opening the door to other suitors for the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon.
The development throws up a major roadblock for Skydance, a movie studio that has been negotiating a complicated deal to merge with Paramount for months. Many Paramount investors have come out against that deal, saying it would enrich Shari Redstone, the company's board chair, at the expense of other shareholders.
The 30-day period for exclusive talks with a special committee of Paramount's board expires at the end of Friday. It is unclear what Skydance, which was founded by the tech scion and producer David Ellison, and its backer, RedBird Capital Partners, will do next. The company could wait for Paramount to re-engage in negotiations, could make a higher bid or could walk away. The company is wary of being used by Paramount to drive up the price for another bidder.
Paramount's special committee will now probably focus on negotiating with another suitor, Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has teamed up with the private equity giant Apollo Global Management to make a $ 26 billion bid for the company. Paramount's shareholders prefer the all-cash offer -- which would include the assumption of Paramount's debt -- because it would give them a substantial premium on the company's current stock price.
Paramount's special committee is set to meet on Saturday to discuss the deal, the two people with knowledge of the company's plans said.
The deal with Sony and Apollo is not without its own risk. Government regulations restrict foreign ownership of broadcast networks, like Paramount's CBS. Sony Pictures Entertainment is a division of the Tokyo-based Sony Group, and it's unlikely that it could obtain a license to own CBS. But there are potential remedies to that problem: Apollo could apply to hold the license to CBS, or the group could decide to sell the network.
Paramount's fate ultimately lies in Ms. Redstone's hands. Her control of National Amusements, Paramount's parent company, gives her the power to block any deal. Ms. Redstone has already signed off on a potential deal between Skydance and National Amusements that would allow her to sell her stake for around $ 2 billion, but that deal hinges on approval of a merger of Paramount and Skydance.
CNBC earlier reported that Paramount was planning to end exclusive negotiations with Skydance.

Roomy Enough for a Retinue and a Met Gala Dress: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Famous actors, singers, athletes and housewives are fans of the Mercedes-Benz van, which has become a staple in streets outside events like the Met Gala.
When Kendall Jenner attended the 2022 Met Gala in a Prada gown with an enormous flowing skirt, getting her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art required special transportation. A limousine would not do, nor would an SUV -- walking in the dress was a challenge; sitting, impossible. The solution: Ms. Jenner would be driven, standing, in a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.
On the way to the event, as a way to relieve her anxiety about running late, Ms. Jenner relieved herself in an ice bucket while standing in the van. "Best decision I ever made," she said of that moment in an episode of "The Kardashians" on Hulu.
The Sprinter van, a towering box on wheels with nearly six-and-a-half feet of head room, is a direct descendant of the earliest motorized caravans developed by Karl Benz in 1896. (Some 30 years later, he and Gottlieb Daimler founded the Mercedes-Benz company.) The Sprinter, first released in Europe in 1995, started being sold domestically in 2010. Last year, Mercedes-Benz unveiled an electric version.
The van -- which can be used to transport up to 15 passengers (or cargo) -- is appreciated by automotive enthusiasts for its build quality, reliability and versatility, as well as for the thrust and longevity of the diesel engine in most versions.
But other people have come to recognize the Sprinter for different reasons, among them its proximity to celebrities. The van has become a preferred mode of transportation for actors, singers, athletes and "Real Housewives," and is now a staple in streets outside star-studded events like the Oscars and the Met Gala.
The vans have become so popular as transportation to the spring gala in New York that demand for them can outstrip the local supply. "Sprinters are being brought in from Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami," said Etienne Haro, the general manager of the Mark Hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where many Met Gala guests spend time both before and after the main event.
In recent years, between 50 and 70 guests have traveled to the gala from the Mark, with about 40to 50 of those people riding in Sprinters. Many of those vans are rented and driven by guests' personal chauffeurs. On the day of the gala, the Mark has a team of about 30 people tracking vehicles' locations to ensure their passengers arrive punctually, Mr. Haro said.
Sprinter riders often take advantage of the van's roomy interior to ensure they also arrive looking flawless. "The entourage, glam team, stylist -- everyone can hop in to put on the finishing touches," Mr. Haro said.
But occasionally, he added, some Sprinter passengers have hit bumps in the road on their way to and from the gala.
"Getting out of a Sprinter with a voluminous gown and high heels can be challenging," Mr. Haro said, noting one instance in which a Mark employee caught a Met Gala guest "in midair" as she was falling out of a van. He recalled another guest "whose dress was so intricate that she could not enter her vehicle."
Though it bears Mercedes-Benz's three-point-star logo, the Sprinter has an otherwise innocuous exterior that, for some famous fans, has as much appeal as its capacious interior.
"Our clients say, 'The paparazzi are chasing us around; we don't want to be in something that's sticking out like a sore thumb, like a Rolls or a Bentley," said Howard Becker, the founder of Becker Automotive Design in Southern California, which has customized Sprinter vans and other vehicles for people like the director Steven Spielberg, the actor Mark Wahlberg and the television host Steve Harvey.
"The Sprinter kind of fades in," said Mr. Becker, 75.
The starting price for a diesel-engine van is about $ 50,000; electric Sprinters start at about $ 72,000. But models outfitted by Mr. Becker or by Gabi Mashal, whose Southern California company Bespoke Coach also customizes the vans, typically cost between $ 350,000 and $ 450,000.
Their distinctive features can include temperature-controlled, lie-flat seats with built-in massagers, secure internet routers, state-of-the-art stereo and video systems and onboard bathrooms for their owners.
"These people can't use a public restroom," said Mr. Mashal, 60, who has customized vans for the singer Mark Anthony and the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.
The Sprinter's size and luxurious reputation are reasons it has replaced vehicles like limousines and SUVs as the rental transportation of choice on many versions of "The Real Housewives," said Nate Green, an executive producer of "The Real Housewives of Miami." He described the Sprinter as a friend of the "Housewives," using a term given to supporting characters in the franchise who appear regularly in episodes.
Mr. Green said his show's crew also favors Sprinters because the van's cabin has enough room for camera operators to stand -- and to film from several angles.
"This is really important," Mr. Green said, "because 'Housewives' is sometimes more about the reaction than about the actual dialogue."
Throughout the reality TV franchise's 18 years on Bravo, Sprinter vans have been a place where housewives have drunkenly fallen down, signed divorce papers, passionately kissed co-stars, engaged in verbal spats and been approached by officers with the Department of Homeland Security.
"When people see a Sprinter van, they know that there's going to be something that happens that's going to be iconic," said Lisa Shannon, an executive producer of the New York and Salt Lake City installments of "The Real Housewives," as well as its "Ultimate Girls Trip" spinoff.
The Sprinter, while strongly associated with the "Housewives" franchise, has appeared in more than 4,000 movies and TV episodes. Like many tokens of pop culture, it has been imitated on "The Simpsons," and it recently joined one of cinema's most distinguishable automotive fleets: the vehicles in "Ghostbusters."
In the series's latest film, "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire," released in March, a new van called Ecto-Z -- a black Sprinter outfitted with racks for proton packs -- is featured alongside the tail-finned 1959 Cadillac ambulance known to many as the Ecto-1.
Eric Reich, an executive producer of "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire," said a Sprinter was chosen for the Ecto-Z role after Mercedes-Benz and Sony, the film's distributor, had meetings to discuss product placement. He added that a Sprinter, like a Cadillac, made sense for transporting the Ghostbusters and their gear because both vehicles blend "luxury and function."
That amalgamation has also made Sprinters popular among so-called vanlifers -- people known for cavorting, traveling and sleeping in customized vans. Many of them document their lifestyles online, including Peter Holcombe, 51, who has spent much of the last decade living with his wife, Kathy, 50, and daughter, Abby, 19, in four Sprinter vans outfitted by the motor-home company Winnebago. (The Holcombes are brand ambassadors for Mercedes-Benz and Winnebago; they bought three of their vans at a discount.)
In their vans, the family has visited all 50 states, several national parks and 19 European countries. (Last year, Abby moved out of the family vehicle and into one of her own.) The Holcombes are currently driving what's known as the Pan-American Highway, a network of roads that runs from Alaska to the southern tip of South America.
"We've done over 400,000 miles in Sprinters," Mr. Holcombe said.
Wes Siler, a backcountry camper and a columnist for Outside magazine in Bozeman, Mont., is less of a fan.
Mr. Siler, 43, who camps out of a converted pickup truck, said the cost of buying and customizing a Sprinter for outdoor exploring is excessive for what he described as little more than a "poseur backdrop."
"They're cool on Instagram," he said. "That's, like, the entire story."
But even Mr. Siler, who grew up in Europe, recognizes that the van has a certain appeal. He recalled getting to prom at his high school in London in a Sprinter that had been outfitted as a party bus.
"You couldn't want a better limo," he said.

Love It, Hate It, Fear It: How TikTok Changed Our Culture

Has there ever been a more expressively American app than TikTok, with its messy democratic creativity, energetic exhibitionism, utter lack of limits and vast variety of hustlers?
And yet in April, President Joe Biden signed into law a bill that would force the Chinese owners of TikTok, the video-app juggernaut, to either sell to a non-Chinese owner or face a ban.
Congress passed the bill, which gives the company nine months to strike a deal, with broad bipartisan support. Lawmakers say the app is a national security threat and that the Chinese government could lean on its owner, ByteDance, to obtain sensitive U.S. user data or influence content on the app to serve its interests.
There’s a long road of legal challenges and potential deal-making ahead before TikTok could be forced to change ownership or face a ban. The effort would have to survive lawsuits from TikTok and creators, a deep-pocketed buyer would have to be found and then clear regulatory approval, and after all that, Beijing could simply block a deal.
But imagining what a United States without TikTok would look like throws into sharp relief just how much the app has worked its way into the cultural firmament.
TikTok, which officially landed in the United States in 2018, was the most downloaded app in the country, and the world, in 2020, 2021 and 2022. It wasn’t that the elements of it were so new — compelling videos from randos had long been a staple of American pop culture — but TikTok put the pieces together in a new way.
Unlike Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, TikTok didn’t build itself around social connections. Its goal is pure, uncut entertainment. The algorithm ingested every data point it could from what users skipped, liked or shared — and spat it directly into the maddeningly habit-forming “For You” page. Fans whispered reverently that it knew them better than they knew themselves.
But even more striking has been what the app has done outside its boundaries. Even if you’ve never opened the app, you’ve lived in a culture that exists downstream of what happens there.
What follows are ways of understanding how TikTok became part of American life.
— SAPNA MAHESHWARI It’s Generation Z’s Walter Cronkite
Recently, V Spehar has posted TikTok videos telling viewers what they might have missed from Biden’s State of the Union address, the first 15 actions that former President Donald Trump said he would take if he’s reelected in November and Caitlin Clark’s WNBA starting salary.
Spehar posts to more than 3 million followers from the handle @UnderTheDeskNews and films many clips lying on the floor, a gimmick that began as an effort to differentiate from the authoritative tone of traditional television news anchors. The style of communication has resonated enough to make Spehar a regular at White House briefings with social media influencers.
News aggregation and analysis accounts like Spehar’s are shaping the discourse about current events in the United States, especially among young people. They’re a modern version of old-school bloggers; users respond to the personal tone and the editorializing. (Some creators have even built followings simply by reading print news articles aloud.)
Pew Research Center has found that about one-third of 18- to 29-year-olds say they get news regularly on TikTok, far outpacing other age groups.
Roughly 16% of all American adults get their news from Instagram, and a similar amount from the social platform X. Far more people consume news on Facebook and YouTube.
The appeal of TikTok and other social sites has made mainstream outlets nervous, and has raised some concerns about accuracy and context as original reporting is funneled through other accounts. The Wall Street Journal has more than 340,000 followers on TikTok, while The New York Times has nearly 630,000 — numbers that pale in comparison with the followings of individual commentators like Spehar.

It Turned Recipes Into Concepts
Cooking is different now. One crucial distinction between the hit recipes of today (like Emily Mariko’s salmon and rice bowl) and those of yesteryear (chicken marbella from “The Silver Palate”) is the medium.
Before, a static image was all you had to get the point across in a recipe, with step-by-step instructions printed in a cookbook.
Now recipes unfold over time. In a 30-second video, there are obvious visual cues that viewers can absorb, techniques they can sink their teeth into. The videos depict process, not just stages, and allow you to jump-cut your way through a recipe in a few blinks.
But for all the access to techniques and cuisines that TikTok has provided home cooks, the platform favors concepts over actual recipes: eggs fried in a puddle of pesto, sandwich fillings chopped into a homogeneous mixture, mini-pancakes served like cereal. The most shareable recipes are the ones that you can watch once, then turn around and make — no measurements, bake times or reading needed. Just dump, stir, like, follow, repeat.
— BECKY HUGHES
It Mimics a Flow State
Much has been said about the “addictive design” of TikTok. But what is the social media site actually doing to our brains?
There is very little research looking at what goes on inside people’s heads while they’re using TikTok. But one small study conducted on Chinese university students used magnetic resonance imaging to compare brain activity while they watched personalized TikTok videos (ones the algorithm had selected based on their past use) versus generalized ones (videos the app recommended to new users).
The students had greater activity in several areas of the brain, including ones associated with reward, attention and processing social information, while viewing personalized videos. In other words, the algorithm did its job.
Other social media platforms have been shown to turn on similar brain regions. So what makes TikTok different? Some experts have proposed that it can send users into a “flow state”: the experience of being so absorbed in a task that the person loses track of time. Backing this up, one study found that TikTok users reported experiencing higher levels of flow than Instagram users.
Flow is often associated with work or hobbies — activities that are challenging enough to be engaging but not frustrating. Watching videos doesn’t require skill the way that many flow-inducing activities do, yet the app is able to induce the feelings of enjoyment, concentration and time distortion that are characteristic of flow, possibly because of the algorithm’s immersive quality.

It Forced Joe Biden to Meme
Biden turned down an opportunity to appear on CBS and reach tens of millions of potential voters tuning in for this year’s Super Bowl. Instead, he released his first TikTok.
“Chiefs or Niners?” asked a disembodied, youthful-sounding voice. “Two great quarterbacks; hard to decide,” replied the president, casually dressed in a half-zip sweater and khakis. The caption was “lol hey guys.”
Team Biden, like most other major politicians, had previously resisted joining the app because of security concerns related to its Chinese ownership. (The Trump campaign is not on TikTok, and Trump has expressed divergent views about the app, proposing a ban during his presidency but recently criticizing an attempt by Congress to curtail its use in the United States.)
Giving in was a nod to the irrefutable importance of TikTok, where about 14% of American adults regularly get news, in an election year. There’s now a small studio in the Biden campaign office in Wilmington, Delaware, where staff members can film “candid” videos with the candidate.
Campaigns have a rich tradition of adapting to the latest technology, from wireless radio to television sets and, more recently, to social platforms like Facebook and Snapchat. Many of these efforts share a how-do-you-do-fellow-kids quality, and in an attempt to avoid appearing out of touch, the Biden campaign relies on young, digitally fluent aides to host its TikToks.
It works, sometimes. One video claims to have Trump “caught on camera” making offensive remarks, an attempt to replicate the amateur spontaneity of many TikToks. (In reality, it’s someone’s iPhone aimed at a TV broadcast of a Trump speech.) Other times it comes across try-hard-y, like the video that dismisses a post by Rep. Jim Jordan using a popular “I Ain’t Reading All That” online meme.
The @bidenhq account, though, is hovering around 299,000 followers — still small beans in the TikTok world. But in a close race, every lol counts.
— MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM
It’s for Shopping … and Brand Development
Most months, when Kiara Springs posts on her TikTok account about miniskirts or linen tops she finds on Amazon, she earns $10,000 to $12,000 for getting people to buy what she suggests. During her biggest month, Springs, 25, raked in $50,000 for her posts.
TikTok is now a multibillion-dollar shopping experience, and companies have glommed on. The internet might have killed malls, but now it is one big mall.
Because the bite-size videos are addictive, and partly because advertising on the platform is relatively inexpensive for smaller brands, the app has become a core part of many companies’ marketing plans. Brands say their videos populated with everyday people can more easily go viral than on, say, Instagram, where they often need to pay expensive influencers. And people who notice shopping-related content spend more time on TikTok, according to eMarketer.
Last year, TikTok debuted a prominent shopping feed on the app that now allows people to buy goods directly from a wide array of vendors. Some fashion and beauty brands think about the TikTok content they could make for a product before developing it.
Fiona Co Chan, a co-founder of Youthforia, a beauty and skin care brand with roughly 190,000 followers on the app, says if she can’t think of 200 TikTok videos that she could make for a product, she’ll most likely scrap it entirely.
— JORDYN HOLMAN
It Helped You Ask for a Raise
In a video by the account @salarytransparentstreet that’s been viewed more than 23 million times, a lawyer candidly shares that she makes $134,000 a year, a teacher says she earns $53,000 and a man who does chemical risk assessments for the federal government divulges that he makes $60,000 a year. Hannah Williams, 27, the content creator behind the account, says the point is to help people understand what they could be earning. (She says she made more than $1 million in 2023, before expenses, through her videos and earns revenue from brand sponsorships and ads.)
FinTok, as the money and personal finance community on the app is called, has fundamentally changed the way we accept advice from strangers — and how much ordinary people are willing to share about a taboo subject: how much money they have.
Sure, the app has allowed finance gurus like Suze Orman to expand their empires. But it has also given rise to people like Vivian Tu, 30, a former Wall Street trader who runs the account @yourrichbff. Tu, who has 2.5 million followers, offers advice on high-yield savings accounts and retirement savings, but she can also take TikTok drama and show people financial lessons from it.
As with anything on TikTok, scrolling through FinTok videos requires an amount of skepticism. Plenty of cryptocurrency creators on TikTok like to focus on potential gains rather than the risks. There are also crypto scams, including a rampant one using deepfake videos of Elon Musk. (Ads for crypto or financial services are banned from TikTok, in part to help protect people from taking on high-risk investments.)
When scams or bad advice crop up, commenters have no problem offering corrections. A video on how to get a high credit limit with dubious methods drew comments accusing the creator of committing fraud. It was soon deleted.

It Led to Self-Diagnosis Becoming an Epidemic
TikTok is a mother lode of mental health content, filled with compelling first-person accounts of everything from major depression to selective mutism. Depending on your perspective, that’s either a very good thing or concerning.
Corey Basch, who analyzed 100 popular TikTok videos with the hashtag #mentalhealth for a 2022 study, emerged concerned about the looping effect of the algorithm.
“What’s so important and disturbing to recognize is the downward spiral that users can get swept into,” said Basch, a professor of public health at William Paterson University. “If one is drawn to posts related to despair and anxiety, they can easily spend hours exposed to repetitive content known as an echo chamber.”
The surge of content about mental health has meant that young people are more likely to self-diagnose before seeing a clinician, psychiatrists report. Diagnoses for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety disorders shot up during the pandemic years, especially among young people.
Some researchers have expressed concern about how profit motives may feed into these trends, since platforms often feature advertising from app-based mental health services, and influencers have sponsorship deals with such companies.
“They say we can diagnose you really quick, just take this five-question quiz and we can send you a prescription in a nice little box,” said Holly Avella, a doctoral candidate at Rutgers University who has researched mental health and social media.
Researchers also warn that TikTok videos can deliver misinformation. A review of literature published last year found that around one-fifth of videos mentioning cognitive behavioral therapy were inaccurate, describing it as ineffective or harmful.
But some users credit the app with breaking open the national conversation around mental illness.
“You can sit there on your pedestal and pooh-pooh it all you want,” said Kate Speer, who has used her social media feeds to describe her experience of serious mental illness. TikTok is helpful for “the very people who are struggling the most, those who don’t have access to services in the real world and who might even be so disabled by mental illness that they are locked in their houses.”

It Might Just Be a Weapon
For years, I thought TikTok was mostly a parenting problem and had only tangential bearing on what I cover: threats to national security. It took a while — and a lot of conversations with both tech firms and government officials — for me to become concerned about the potential that it could also pose a major problem on that front.
Not because the company’s Chinese owners could figure out your dance-move preferences but because the algorithm at the core of the app is wrapped in mystery.
So what’s the issue? The algorithm doesn’t belong to TikTok; it is provided by ByteDance, the Chinese company that controls the platform and develops the code in enormous secrecy in laboratories in Beijing, Singapore and Mountain View, California.
No one outside the company knows exactly what goes into those algorithms. The Chinese government is intent on keeping it that way. It has issued regulations that require Beijing’s regulators to grant permission before any ByteDance algorithms can be licensed to outsiders. They are unlikely to do so.
And so, as long as it is written by ByteDance and can’t be picked apart on the outside, there will always be the risk that it will become a pipeline for influencing citizens, and thus voters, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has noted that because TikTok has emerged as a major source of news — and because it collects data on users that the Chinese government could find useful, even crucial — it poses a serious threat and could become “the most powerful propaganda tool ever.”
That threat is mostly hypothetical at this point. At least based on what the United States has made public. The intelligence agencies have been giving closed-door briefings, but presumably there hasn’t been a classified blockbuster, since there would most likely be great pressure to declassify it.
Still, we have seen waves of new influence campaigns flowing out of China — much of it aimed at nations other than the United States. While TikTok has not been at the center of those campaigns, clearly, the Chinese have learned a lot in the past few years, including from the Russians.
This is not a problem that would be solved by simply selling TikTok’s operations to an American buyer. Sure, the bill that went through Congress bans a new, Western-owned TikTok from having any “operational relationship” with ByteDance, “including any cooperation with respect to the operation of a content recommendation algorithm.” Good luck with that — TikTok would no longer be TikTok.
The real question is whether anyone gets to look under the hood. Because to make Americans trust TikTok, the country will need an early-warning system, something that will assure everyone that a technology that became popular because it generated memes and celebrates self-expression does not become a conduit for a foreign government interested in subtly influencing how we vote.

It Turned the School Bathroom Into a Movie Set
Southern Alamance Middle School, a public school in Graham, North Carolina, recently came up with a novel way to combat student distractions from social media. Or at least to curb the phenomenon that some teachers have dubbed “Toilet TikToks.”
The problem: Educators there noticed a spike in the number of students asking to leave class — sometimes as frequently as nine times per day — to go to the bathroom, where they made TikTok videos.
The solution: Administrators decided to remove the bathroom mirrors that students used to film TikToks and primp for their close-ups. They also introduced an online system that issues students digital hall passes when they want to be excused from class and that allows administrators to track students’ locations. “Since removing the mirrors,” administrators wrote in a message to parents in January, “we have seen a drastic decrease in bathroom visits from students asking to be excused just to make videos.”
Toilettoks — a TikTok genre dating back at least five years in which students use school bathrooms as film sets for dance routines, lip-syncing clips or critiques of unclean lavatories — are one of the milder social media annoyances for schools.
Across the United States, students have also used school bathrooms as arenas to stage, film and post videos of bullying, physical assaults on schoolmates and acts of vandalism.
In March, the Alamance-Burlington School System announced that it was joining dozens of other U.S. districts that have filed lawsuits accusing social media platforms, including TikTok, of unfairly ensnaring young people.
“We’re seeing the negative impacts of social media on our students every day,” said Kristy Davis, acting superintendent of Alamance-Burlington schools. “Their well-being has to be the top priority.”

It Became Hollywood’s Favorite Marketing Machine
Insular, slow-changing Hollywood responded to TikTok’s arrival in 2018 in typical fashion: complete dismissal. We’re way too busy making pictures to worry about some new short-form video app.
Then came denial. (This thing is just another fad.) Next, fear. (Teenagers and young adults are never going to the movies again!)
But there’s a plot twist: Hollywood has come to see TikTok as indispensable.
“Anyone but You,” a Sony romantic comedy starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, arrived to a piddly $8 million in ticket sales over Christmas weekend. The movie turned into a full-fledged hit ($219 million) after TikTok users (at the urging of Sony) began making videos of themselves reenacting the credit sequence.
TikTok also served as a ticket-selling machine for “M3gan,” a Universal-Blumhouse horror movie about a sassy robot that has spawned a new franchise; “Wonka,” which debuted in December and collected $632 million; and the “Barbenheimer” box office phenomenon, otherwise known as “Barbie,” with $1.4 billion, and “Oppenheimer,” with about $1 billion. Rote glamour shots and insipid interviews — ye olde studio publicity tools — don’t work on TikTok; users want behind-the-scenes “realness.” Hence “Oppenheimer” stars goofing in a hotel hallway before a premiere, and pink-clad “Barbie” stars cavorting on the floor with puppies.
“Now that studios have figured out how to harness TikTok, the last thing they want is for it to go dark,” said Sue Fleishman, a former Universal and Warner Bros. executive who is now a consultant. “That would actually be a big problem.”

It Took Over the Other Apps
My favorite Instagram account is a collection of TikToks. Curated by videographer Leia Jospé, @favetiktoks420 hunts for Gen Z’s ickiest thirst traps and bleakest acting exercises and delivers them to me in a millennial-safe package, uploading them directly to a social network that I actually use.
By the time TikTok debuted, in 2017, I was already in my 30s and too old and lazy to work another app into my rotation. Instagram and Twitter were distracting enough. But now those platforms lie downstream of TikTok’s creative wellspring, waiting for bits of its most popular content to drift into the open internet. TikToks float into my friends’ Instagram stories, percolate into our group chats, swirl into my X feed. I rarely open TikTok, but I watch TikToks all the time.
TikToks let loose a chaotic element into Instagram’s internet mall, and they break the monotony of X’s boosted tech-bro threads. They stock YouTube compilations and spark Facebook debates and fuel trend pieces.
If TikTok were to disappear, it would feel, at least for a while, as if the internet’s big content spigot had been turned to a trickle. Rival platforms have tried to remake themselves in TikTok’s image — building in short-form videos, algorithmic timelines and searchable sound clips — but have failed to reproduce the hypnotic energy of its perpetual discovery machine. We’d be left with a diluted version of its secret sauce.
But any network that hopes to capitalize on its own popularity will disrupt its product. Even as other social media platforms try to become TikTok, TikTok is trying to become them, lengthening its videos to compete with YouTube and introducing an e-commerce platform to “drive meaningful shopping experiences” and rival Instagram. Eventually a new, inexplicably addictive platform will rise in its place. And I will rely on the kindness of slightly younger strangers to show me what’s on it.

It Teaches 22-Year-Olds How to Live Like an Adult
Shelley Polanco is 22 and a senior at Brandeis. As she faces life after college, she is not looking for practical advice about, say, jobs and careers. She yearns instead for a guidebook to what it feels like to be an adult, something to tell her about her future emotional life and satisfaction.
And so she likes following TikTok accounts that feature “an older woman of culture, kind of like this auntie figure who gets on TikTok and records ‘things I wish I would have known in my 20s.’”
She’s a fan of @itsrealllylola. “She’s turning 25, and she starts to speak about all the things she’s learned, the ways you maybe want to ignore people’s judgments on you,” Polanco says. “She’s big on ‘live your life and have fun.’”
She peers decades into her future with the help of Dr. Amanda Hanson, “#midlifemuse,” who invites comments about life after 50 from her TikTok followers. Or Shera Seven. “She is this 40-year-old woman, I want to say, giving really brutal dating advice,” Polanco said.
Polanco was having trouble seeing more than three months out but found support from a TikTok transformation coach named Shannon. “I searched ‘how to write goals,’” she said. “There was this lady walking you through this meditation to visualize your future self, and it was one of the only times I could see an older version of myself. It was so inspirational, I closed the app, got out a piece of paper and started writing.”

It Got Taylor Swift to Break a Picket Line
For the music industry, TikTok has become a potent but unpredictable promotional outlet, and a vital one in the race to mint a new hit. Young artists like Olivia Rodrigo and Lil Nas X saw their popularity explode on the platform, and acts like Fleetwood Mac have seen decades-old songs get a boost from memes on the app.
But TikTok is also the latest tech platform to draw the anger of the music industry for low royalty rates. In February, Universal Music Group, which represents artists like Rodrigo, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Drake, withdrew the rights to its music on the app, saying that TikTok was trying to “bully” the company to accept low terms.
Within days, millions of TikTok videos using music from Universal artists went mute, and since then guessing which side would blink first has become a media-business parlor game.
Last month, however, Swift — who releases her music through Universal but has owned the copyrights to her work since 2018 — broke ranks and put her songs back on TikTok, just before the release of her latest album. In the industry, this was seen as badly weakening Universal’s leverage, though Swift is also in some ways an industry unto herself, with powers beyond even those of other big stars.
Three weeks later, Universal and TikTok announced a new agreement.

It Supercharges Conspiracy Theories
Several dentists recently took to TikTok to debunk a conspiracy theory: that toothpaste tubes were printed with secret codes signaling their true ingredients to powerful people.
Their efforts garnered far fewer views than the video that offered up the theory in January. Not counting all the times the post was referenced in videos by other TikTok users, it has been seen more than 7 million times in less than three months.
Tall tales are common on TikTok, where a patchwork of assumptions and coincidences — often concerning the schemes of nefarious elites — is accompanied by spooky music and dramatic images generated by artificial intelligence. (Other such hits include false theories that Biden rigged the Super Bowl or that Justin Bieber was a victim of Pizzagate. False allegations of voter fraud also abound.)
Abbie Richards, a misinformation researcher who studies TikTok, said such posts thrived because of the platform’s potent recommendation algorithms and its low barrier to entry.
TikTok allows users to earn money from their videos through tools like its creator rewards program and livestream subscriptions. Conspiracy theories are one of the most profitable categories, said Richards, a senior video producer at the liberal watchdog group Media Matters.
“It’s like candy for your brain; it tells a story that simplifies the world in a way that feels good to you,” she said.
The promoters of the toothpaste theory claimed that the colored dots on toothpaste tubes correspond to all-natural, medicinal or chemical ingredients.
The post was quickly reposted, copied and stitched into reaction videos. Some came from dentists, who explained that the dots were actually used during the toothpaste packaging process to help guide manufacturing equipment to properly cut and seal the tubes.
Colgate, a major toothpaste manufacturer, addressed the color patch rumor last year and said that “as much as we love cracking secret codes, this one actually has nothing to crack because it’s entirely untrue.”
Even silly rumors, however, can spin out from TikTok into real-world harms. The baseless concerns that store-bought toothpaste tubes might hide toxic ingredients reignited recommendations to opt instead for potentially damaging homemade options.

It Won Over the Snobbiest Gatekeeper
Is there any more official signal that a business titan has arrived at the heart of the American social-financial-artistic-political power nexus than being invited to be an honorary host of the Met Gala, aka “the party of the year”? Is there any more glamorous recognition than being asked to join its convener, Vogue editor Anna Wintour, in the Metropolitan Museum’s soaring atrium as the great and the good of Hollywood, fashion, sports, Wall Street and Washington swan past?
On Monday, TikTok will be lead sponsor of both the party and the museum fashion exhibition it celebrates. CEO Shou Chew has been named an honorary chair of this year’s gala, along with Loewe designer Jonathan Anderson, while Wintour, Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth are the event’s co-chairs.
That placement would put TikTok firmly in the tradition of previous gala sponsors like Amazon, Instagram and Apple — tech companies bedazzled by the Old Establishment, which in turn is bedazzled by their blush of upstart cool.
It is an acknowledgment, if any were needed, of the prominent role the app has come to play in fashion in a mere few years.
It was only in 2021, after all, that Wintour was criticized for inviting TikTok stars such as Addison Rae and Dixie D’Amelio to the party — for somehow cheapening it by catering to the BuzzFeed machine of the smartphone, rather than the elite. After all, not just anyone can get an invitation, even if the $50,000 price tag for a seat seems affordable; Wintour vets every guest, and the price of admission has to do with cultural currency even more than actual currency.
Which is why, of course, TikTok belongs. Despite the fact that all social media is forbidden inside the party.
Fast-forward three years, and there are more than 75 billion views associated with the #TikTokfashion hashtag; almost 500 million with #2023Gala alone. Luxury brands routinely sign up TikTok stars as brand ambassadors along with every other kind of star, hoping for access to their audience (received relevance is something Vogue might be getting out of the association, too). And thus is created a virtuous — or vicious? — cycle in which TikTok feeds the gala machine, which feeds TikTok, which is the vicarious experience that has come to feed us all.

It Made You Buy That One Water Bottle
When a product goes viral on TikTok, those views often translate directly into increased sales. In some cases, the effect has been significant.
Stanley Tumblers
Company revenue last year was $750 million, up from $73 million in 2019, after the product became a sensation on TikTok.
Feta Cheese
Demand jumped 200% at one grocery chain in 2021, after a recipe for baked feta pasta took off and amassed more than 20 million views.
Cat Crack Catnip
It briefly sold out in 2021 after TikTok users posted videos of their cats going crazy for it.
Isle of Paradise Tanning Spray
It sold out in 48 hours in 2021 after a post about it went viral.
Prepdeck Kitchen Storage Products
They went out of stock in 2021 after going viral.

It Knows Where You Live
Every social media app is, essentially, a spy in your pocket. When it comes to data collection, TikTok is no worse than the others. The main difference, and the one that’s driving the current conversation in Washington, is that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company.
TikTok, like other apps, seeks a huge amount of information from you, and some pieces of it that can seem innocuous are quite revealing, including:
Your IP address and location. An Internet Protocol address is a unique identifier associated with your device or the network you use to get on the internet. TikTok can use your IP address and location to determine the advertising you see, but it can also reveal other real-life associations. When people access a social network from the same IP address, it reveals that they may know one another offline. ByteDance, which owns TikTok, used IP address data collected from journalists using the app to try to identify company employees who were speaking to them.
Your contacts. Giving TikTok access to the hundreds (or thousands) of numbers and email addresses on your phone — an opt-in feature — lets it draw unexpected insights into your life, such as who your doctors are, your current and former colleagues, your one-night stands, and on and on. TikTok may then recommend you follow them as “people you may know,” and your account, in turn, will be suggested to them, so beware of sharing contacts if you’re trying to stay anonymous. Even if you don’t share your contacts, TikTok can look for the phone or email address you gave the company in other users’ address books unless you go into the privacy settings and turn off “Suggest Your Account to Others.”
Your messages. Unless your messages are end-to-end encrypted, which they are not on TikTok, they can be reviewed by the company storing them for you.
Your viewing history. Are you obsessed with steamy “Twilight” highlight reels or home repair videos? TikTok knows.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Berkshire Hathaway shareholders will gather in Omaha for the conglomerate's annual meeting on Saturday, with questions about the company's future.
A different kind of Berkshire annual meeting
Tens of thousands of investors are flocking to Omaha this weekend, which can mean only one thing: It's time for Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, dubbed the "Woodstock for capitalists."
The allure had long been the chance to see Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger live, answering attendees' questions with a time-tested buddy-comedy act. But this year's event will be the first without Munger, who died in November at age 99 -- and comes amid growing questions about Berkshire post-Buffett, who's 93.
Buffett will have a different crew answering questions alongside him on Saturday. Berkshire's vice chairmen, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, will be on hand for much of the day. Shareholders most likely will be focused on what Abel, Buffett's appointed successor as C.E.O. and the head of the conglomerate's noninsurance operations, has to say.
In Buffett's annual letter to investors, he noted challenges to Berkshire's biggest businesses, including the BNSF railroad (falling shipment volumes) and its utility business (forest fires). Last month, the company's enormous real estate brokerage, HomeServices of America, also agreed to pay $ 250 million to settle lawsuits over inflated home-sales commissions.
Shareholders may want to hear what Jain, as the longtime mastermind behind Berkshire's vital reinsurance operations, has to say about the business that makes most of Buffett's investing possible.
Expect lots of questions about Berkshire's signature investments. The company's stock performance this year has outpaced that of Apple (one of Buffett's biggest investments; more on that below), Microsoft and Tesla, as well as the S&P 500.
But with interest rates remaining higher for longer and many tech giants' shares losing steam, shareholders will want to know where Buffett sees future opportunities. That may include the company's investments in the oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum and five Japanese trading houses, whose stocks have soared.
Attendees may also want Buffett to explain what may be his most consequential admission in recent years: Berkshire is now so big that it's unlikely to find any major acquisitions -- the historical source of Buffett's outsize investment returns -- to spend its $ 163 billion cash pile on. "All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance," he wrote in this year's annual letter.
And there may be questions about Buffett's stock-picking lieutenants. Todd Combs and Ted Weschler have been managing portions of Berkshire's investment portfolio for years. But their performance has long lagged behind that of Buffett himself and the S&P 500, according to the Financial Times, raising questions about Berkshire's future value proposition.
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
The Justice Department's investigation into TD Bank reportedly focuses on fentanyl. Investigators found that Chinese drug traffickers and crime groups used the Canadian bank to launder hundreds of millions in illicit drug proceeds, The Wall Street Journal reports. The accusation adds to the scrutiny of the bank's anti-money laundering practices, which is at the center of other regulatory investigations in the U.S. and Canada.
President Biden makes his first public comments on campus protests. Biden condemned the violence on Thursday while defending the right to demonstrate peacefully. The president is eager to keep the issue from eroding his support with young voters but he has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans for not speaking out.
Arguments in the Google antitrust case conclude on Friday. The Justice Department says the company competed unfairly in making deals with Apple and other companies to lock in search functionality on smartphones and web browsers. Google counters that it earned its market edge through innovation. The trial is the biggest challenge yet to Big Tech's dominance, and the judge's verdict, expected later this year, could change how Google does business.
A mega buyback lifts Apple
After a rocky stretch, Apple is predicting a return to growth in 2024. That, and an unprecedented $ 110 billion share-buyback promise, have lifted shares by more than 6 percent in premarket trading this morning despite another sales decline and big worries about China.
Apple is the latest Big Tech giant to report results in recent weeks -- next up is Nvidia on May 22. Investors are zeroing in on when huge investments, especially in artificial intelligence, will pay off.
Apple's rally belies a litany of challenges, including a sluggish market for smartphones and wearables, intensifying competition in China, heightened regulatory scrutiny, a lackluster debut for the Vision Pro headset and questions about its A.I. efforts. (The company is expected to reveal how it will incorporate A.I. into its devices at a developers conference next month.)
Add it up, and sales have declined at the king of growth stocks in five of the past six quarters and shares are down nearly 7 percent this year. A big question on Wall Street: What will Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway do with its $ 157 billion Apple stake?
The big takeaways from Thursday's earnings report:
Sales fell 4 percent on an annualized basis to $ 90.8 billion last quarter, and profit dipped by 2 percent to $ 23.6 billion. Both reductions exceeded analysts expectations.
Apple reported $ 16.4 billion of revenues in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. That's up compared to the previous quarter, driven by the iPhone. Investors are worried about Apple's hold on the world's No. 2 smartphone market, where consumers are shifting to local rivals amid a wider crackdown on foreign-made tech.
The company also sought to reassure on generative A.I. Apple isn't investing the vast sums that rival tech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, are spending on the technology. That has helped protect its profit outlook, but it has also left investors unsure about its strategy.
Tim Cook, Apple's C.E.O., tried to express confidence that the company would catch up by deploying A.I. across its devices and services. "Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services" -- including its in-house chips -- will give the company an edge, he told analysts.
The Paramount race heads to a cliffhanger
After weeks of anticipation, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management have made it official: They've formally expressed interest in buying Paramount for about $ 26 billion.
That puts extra pressure on the Paramount board's special committee that's evaluating the company's future. Those directors are already facing a deadline on Friday for exclusive deal talks with Skydance, the studio led by the tech scion David Ellison (and the preferred suitor of Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone).
Is the Sony-Apollo bid a game-changer? Sony has deep experience in entertainment, with Apollo providing a big slug of capital. Sony plans to be the majority shareholder, making Paramount a division within its broader film and television empire and putting franchises like "Spider-Man" and "Mission: Impossible" under one roof.
That said, the $ 26 billion figure is preliminary: Sony and Apollo haven't started due diligence, which could affect their ultimate takeover proposal.
There are regulatory concerns, including whether the Sony-Apollo bid would be hamstrung by federal restrictions on foreign ownership of broadcast networks like Paramount's CBS.
Apollo and Sony believe workarounds are available; one could be having Apollo, which has already been approved for network ownership after acquiring Cox Media Group, own the license for CBS. Still, the F.C.C. blocked a takeover bid of the broadcaster Tegna because of Apollo's role in financing that transaction.
What happens next? Here are some possibilities:
Paramount's special committee signs a deal with Skydance that includes a low breakup fee and a so-called go-shop provision that lets it negotiate with Sony and Apollo. That would likely give Skydance a chance to match, setting up a bidding war and, if Sony and Apollo won, a mandatory payout to Skydance. (It could also lead to a lower price than what a traditional auction would have fetched, giving already irate shareholders more reason to gripe -- or sue.)
Paramount could let the exclusivity period with Skydance expire at midnight tonight and open its books to Sony and Apollo. That, of course, risks the Sony-Apollo duo not making a formal bid -- and Skydance walking away.
$ 76 billion
-- What the N.B.A. is set to get from two new broadcasting agreements with Disney and Amazon, three times the size of its current deal, according to Bloomberg. The league is also reportedly considering another package with Warner Bros. Discovery and Comcast.
The F.T.C.'s surprise for Big Oil
Exxon Mobil's $ 60 billion purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources is set to close on Friday. The F.T.C. gave its blessing, but the regulator extracted an unusual concession: It barred Scott Sheffield, the shale oil producer's former C.E.O., from joining Exxon's board, saying he colluded with OPEC to manipulate oil prices.
The accusations could lead to criminal charges and send a shudder through the industry as deal making hits record highs.
The F.T.C.'s case: The agency said that its merger review found Sheffield's text messages, public statements and in-person meetings with OPEC officials were evidence he tried to distort the global market for oil prices and to profit from it. "American consumers shouldn't pay unfair prices at the pump simply to pad a corporate executive's pocketbook," said Kyle Mach, the F.T.C.'s deputy competition chief. The F.T.C. reportedly plans to refer Sheffield's case to the Justice Department.
Pioneer said the F.T.C. doesn't understand the oil industry. It disputed the accusations but said it and Sheffield wouldn't do anything to stop the Exxon deal going through.
Others accused the regulator of overreach. Eric Grannon, an antitrust lawyer at White & Case, told The Wall Street Journal that using a merger-review process to target an executive wasn't "principled antitrust enforcement."
It's another case of the F.T.C. chair, Lina Khan, pushing antitrust policy boundaries. The F.T.C. doesn't have the authority to make criminal charges. But in 2021, after she became chair, the regulator vowed to expand its corporate referral program to other agencies that do.
M.&A. in the oil sector hit a record in the first quarter after a bumper 2023. But some analysts warn about a chill on activity if the F.T.C. takes a tougher stance on mergers. "Any C.E.O. contemplating a merger will have to worry about being singled out the way Sheffield was," James Lucier, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, wrote in a client note Thursday.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the suit, lawyers for the former Nickelodeon producer called the documentary a "hit job" that had falsely painted him as a "child sexual abuser."
The television producer Dan Schneider filed a defamation lawsuit on Wednesday against the creators of the documentary series "Quiet on Set," which aired accounts of sexual abuse and other inappropriate behavior on sets at Nickelodeon, where Schneider was once a star creator of content.
The five-episode series, "Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV," included interviews from former employees who denounced Schneider as a boss and objected to sexualized humor in his shows, leading him to release a video in March in which he apologized for some of his behavior on the job, such as soliciting massages on set from staff members.
But the show also focused on Nickelodeon employees who had been convicted of child sex crimes -- including Brian Peck, a dialogue coach for Nickelodeon, who was sentenced to prison for sexually abusing the "Drake & Josh" star Jared Drake Bell.
Schneider's lawsuit accuses the documentary of improperly conflating him with those who had been convicted of abusing children and took issue with segments of the series that his lawyers said "falsely and repeatedly state or imply that Schneider is a child sexual abuser."
"Schneider will be the first to admit that some of what they said is true," the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, said of the filmmakers. "At times, he was blind to the pain that some of his behavior caused certain colleagues, subordinates and cast members. He will regret and atone for this behavior the rest of his life. But one thing he is not -- and the one thing that will forever mar his reputation and career both past and present -- is a child sexual abuser."
Schneider declined to be interviewed for the series, instead issuing a statement that was included in the documentary, in which he denied various accusations leveled against him and said that "everything that happened on the shows I ran was carefully scrutinized by dozens of involved adults."
The listed defendants in the case include Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns Max, where the series was streamed; Maxine Productions and Sony Pictures Television, which produced it; and Mary Robertson and Emma Schwartz, who directed the series. None of the parties immediately responded to a request for comment.
Calling the series a "hit job," the lawsuit said that in several instances viewers were led to inaccurately infer that he was a child sexual abuser, including in the trailer, in which a series of photos and video clips of Schneider are followed by the advertisement of a "true crime event."
"The harm to Schneider's reputation, career, and business, to say nothing of his own overwhelming emotional distress, cannot be understated," said the lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of damages.
The lawsuit said that Schneider's legal representatives had sent a letter demanding that the series "not include any statements that allege or imply that Schneider engaged in any criminal or sexual misconduct," and that the defendants' lawyer responded that there were no "statements" that defamed him.
Starting in the 1990s, Schneider created, scripted and produced a string of hits for Nickelodeon including "All That," "The Amanda Show," "Drake & Josh" and "Zoey 101."
But in the spring of 2018, Schneider and Nickelodeon suddenly issued a joint statement announcing their separation. Almost overnight, he largely disappeared from public view.
In 2021, The New York Times reported that before that announcement, ViacomCBS, the parent company of Nickelodeon, had investigated Schneider and found that many people he worked with viewed him as verbally abusive. The company's review found no evidence of sexual misconduct by Schneider.
The recent documentary series included information about how Schneider and Nickelodeon parted ways, and reported that the investigation into his conduct "did not find any evidence of inappropriate sexual behavior" or "inappropriate relationships with children."
The series was a ratings hit and stirred up conversations about the appropriateness of some of the material on children's television. Critics said the shows contained barely veiled sexual innuendo, and Schneider, in his apology video, said he would be willing to cut out parts of the show that were upsetting to people, years after they first aired. At the same time, though, he suggested that the criticism came from adults looking at jokes written for children "through their lens."

Sony and Apollo Express Interest In Striking Deal For Paramount: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Paramount has been exploring a potential deal for months, talking to suitors including Skydance, producer of "Top Gun: Maverick."
Sony Pictures Entertainment and the private equity giant Apollo Global Management have formally expressed interest in acquiring Paramount for roughly $ 26 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter, a move that adds drama to an already chaotic deal making process.
The nonbinding expression of interest, sent in a letter this week, comes as Paramount approaches an agreed-upon Friday deadline for the expiration of an exclusive negotiating period with Skydance, a Hollywood studio run by the tech scion David Ellison. Paramount has been in talks with Skydance for months, discussing a complicated transaction that would involve a merger and an investment from the private equity firm Redbird Capital Partners.
The new, joint expression of interest would make Sony a significant majority and controlling shareholder and Apollo a minority shareholder. The proposed all-cash acquisition may appeal to Paramount shareholders who have come out against the Skydance deal over concerns it benefits the company's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, at the expense of others.
Paramount declined to comment.
The proposed merger of Sony and Paramount would create a new powerhouse in Hollywood, uniting the studios behind the "Spider Man" and "Mission: Impossible" franchises. Sony executives have discussed operating the Paramount studio as a division of their broader empire, combining their marketing and distribution functions.
Sony, a sprawling international conglomerate known for its cutting-edge electronics business, is an unconventional suitor for Paramount. Like Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, Sony has a highly profitable business outside traditional media, generating hundreds of millions of dollars from video games, music, imaging and sensors. That insulates Sony from the travails of the media industry, which has lately been challenged by the decline of the traditional theatrical business and the death of cable television.
The letter, which was signed by Tony Vinciquerra, the chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Aaron Sobel, a partner at Apollo, is intended to be a starting point for negotiations to acquire the company, according to be a person familiar with the matter. The two sides have not begun doing due diligence, a process that could affect the amount Sony and Apollo are willing to pay.
One looming question for both Apollo and Sony is the eventual fate of Paramount's CBS broadcast network. Regulations restrict foreign ownership of broadcast networks, throwing up a potential roadblock for Sony Pictures, a division of the Tokyo-based Sony Group Corporation.
But the companies believe they can overcome those concerns, according to two people familiar with their plans. Apollo, a U.S.-based firm, already owns the TV station group Cox Media Group, a deal that required approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates U.S. broadcasters. The F.C.C., however, blocked a separate deal that involved Apollo, when the investment firm Standard General tried to buy Tegna, a TV station group, with financing from Apollo.
One possible remedy under consideration is to have Apollo, which has already gone through government approval, hold the license for the CBS broadcast network, the people said.
It remains to be seen whether a bid from Sony and Apollo would be acceptable to Ms. Redstone, whose controlling stake would allow her to veto any deal. Ms. Redstone has already signed off on a potential deal to sell her controlling stake to Skydance, but that deal is contingent on a separate deal for Paramount.
The expression of interest from Apollo and Sony heaps additional scrutiny on the special committee of Paramount's board of directors that is evaluating the company's options. An all-cash alternative to Skydance's offer -- for which many shareholders have expressed support -- would put more pressure on negotiations between Mr. Ellison and Paramount.
The deal talks come at a chaotic time for Paramount. Bob Bakish, the company's former chief executive, stepped down this week amid tensions with Ms. Redstone. Mr. Bakish, who had expressed reservations about the deal with Skydance, was an architect of the company's current strategy, which involves signing up subscribers to the Paramount+ streaming service.
In his place, Paramount's board has installed a trio of executives who run an "office of the C.E.O." within the company. Collectively, the executives -- CBS's chief executive, George Cheeks; the Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios chief executive Chris McCarthy; and Paramount's chief executive, Brian Robbins -- have decades of experience at the company but are untested in their current three-way leadership role.

Paramount Chief to Leave Amid Plans for a Merger: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bob Bakish was once a staunch ally of Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder. His departure comes as the company considers a major merger.
Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount, has tried to resist the erosion of her media empire over the last decade as she confronted the death of cable TV, the rise of streaming and even a failed boardroom coup from a longtime ally.
By her side through it all has been Bob Bakish, Paramount's chief executive. For years, she saw him as a loyal lieutenant who could navigate the treacherous entertainment industry with the financial dexterity of the management consultant he once was. As Paramount's share price sagged, she was patient with him -- even as she steered the company toward an eventual sale that he had reservations about.
That patience officially ran out on Monday.
Mr. Bakish is stepping down effective immediately, Paramount announced on Monday, a stunning shake-up in the top ranks of the company as it considers a major merger.
Mr. Bakish, 60, will be replaced by an "office of the C.E.O." run by three executives: Brian Robbins, head of the Paramount movie studio; George Cheeks, chief executive of Paramount's CBS division; and Chris McCarthy, chief executive of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios.
Looming over Mr. Bakish's exit are broader questions about the future of Paramount. Like many media companies, Paramount has struggled in recent years to get its streaming business off the ground as audiences for its cable channels have diminished. As a result, it has long been considered an acquisition target by rivals looking to build up their content libraries and increase their leverage in cable negotiations.
In recent months, the company has been in discussions to merge with Skydance, a media company run by the tech scion and Hollywood executive David Ellison. Ms. Redstone, who is Paramount's controlling shareholder, has already signed off on a potential deal for her stake, but the company's directors have yet to reach an agreement for the whole company.
Several shareholders have come out publicly against a combination with Skydance, saying it would enrich Ms. Redstone at the expense of other investors. The private equity firm Apollo Global Management and Sony have discussed making an all-cash bid for Paramount, an offer that could give the company a serious alternative. But any talks with other suitors must wait until the exclusive negotiation period with Skydance lapses, in early May.
In an effort to assuage those concerns, Skydance sweetened its proposal in recent days. The company told Paramount that it would provide a $ 3 billion cash infusion to pay down debt and buy back shares, money that would come from the private-equity firm RedBird Capital and the Ellison family. Skydance also offered to give Paramount shareholders a larger stake in the combined company than it previously contemplated.
It is unclear if Skydance's sweeteners will be enough to convince the special committee of board members evaluating the merger with Skydance that the deal treats all shareholders fairly. The rare nature of Mr. Bakish's departure could put extra pressure on the committee to show it's negotiating the best deal for shareholders, said Jim Woolery, founder of Woolery & Company, an advisory firm.
"It creates a point of leverage," said Mr. Woolery, who has advised many special committees. He said the special committee was now more likely to open up deal talks with Apollo and Sony or consider allowing rival bidders to step in after any deal with Skydance was signed and giving Skydance a limited right to match a higher offer.
Mr. Bakish had been an employee of Paramount since 1997, and he and Ms. Redstone had been allies for years. He took over as chief executive in 2016 after a rift opened between the Redstone family and one of his predecessors, Philippe Dauman, and Mr. Bakish was her preferred candidate to run the company after it merged with CBS in 2019.
But Ms. Redstone's relationship with Mr. Bakish began deteriorating over the last year, three people familiar with their interactions said. Ms. Redstone perceived that he had missed opportunities to strike lucrative deals for the company, including a sale of its Showtime and BET cable networks, they said. In 2021, the private equity firm Blackstone expressed interest in acquiring the Showtime cable network for at least $ 5.5 billion, an eye-watering sum for a business in long-term decline, one of the people said. Paramount did not pursue that deal.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Blackstone's interest in Showtime.
Mr. Bakish is in line for a big payday. According to the data firm Equilar, he is entitled to a severance package of $ 50.6 million, with $ 31 million of that in the form of cash for the two years after his employment is terminated.
Ms. Redstone came to believe that Mr. Bakish wasn't moving with enough urgency to get Paramount on firmer footing, the three people said. Mr. Bakish also told the special committee this year that he had reservations about a merger with Skydance, one of the people said.
Mr. Bakish's position became untenable in recent weeks after he presented a long-term plan to the special committee that Ms. Redstone believed did not adequately reflect the input of the company's top executives, including Mr. Robbins, Mr. Cheeks and Mr. McCarthy, the three people said. Ms. Redstone approved discussions between those executives and representatives of the board, including Charles Phillips. During the conversations, the executives expressed misgivings about the direction of the company, the people said.
Mr. Bakish's departure ends an important chapter in Paramount's history. He was a pioneer of a strategy to offer streaming entertainment directly to consumers, creating the Paramount+ streaming service and acquiring Pluto TV, a free, ad-supported streaming service.
Mr. Bakish had an unlikely path to the top of Paramount. A former consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, he joined Viacom, Paramount's predecessor, after advising Paramount Communications on strategy for its Madison Square Garden division. Mr. Bakish rose to become head of Viacom's international channels division, and was tapped in 2016 to succeed Tom Dooley as chief executive.
He got the top job during a perilous time for Viacom. The company's bellicose approach to negotiations with cable companies -- its most important partners -- resulted in its being dropped by the Suddenlink cable system in 2014. Viacom's share price tumbled. Mr. Bakish took a more measured approach to negotiations, improving the relationship with cable providers and stabilizing the company.
Despite those efforts, Paramount's share price has continued to sink over the years, reflecting investors' skepticism about the cable TV business. Over the last year, the price has fallen 48 percent as the cable bundle -- once an industry-defining juggernaut -- continues to lose subscribers.
After more than a quarter-century at the company and its predecessor, Mr. Bakish received an unceremonious send-off from Paramount. In brief remarks at the end of the company's first-quarter earnings call on Monday, Paramount's chief financial officer offered his former boss terse congratulations on navigating "a number of challenges."
He did not take any questions.

Hollywood Rediscovers Joy of Sex: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Studios obsessively focused on PG-13 franchises and animation in recent years, but movies like "Challengers" and "Saltburn" show eroticism has returned.
Zendaya, clad in a skintight dress, gyrates on a dance floor in "Challengers," a $ 56 million sports drama that arrived in multiplexes on Friday. "It's getting hot in here," the hip-hop soundtrack intones, as she closes her eyes and runs her hands through her hair, lost in fantasy. "So take off all your clothes."
The story continues at a motel, where Zendaya, playing a tennis prodigy, begins a ménage à trois with two guys; it fizzles after they become more interested in each other. The plot moves on -- to sultry interplay on the hood of a car, in a dorm room, in the back seat of a car, on the wooden slats of a sauna. There is erotic churro eating.
"Sex is back!" shouted an apparently elated man at the conclusion of a prerelease "Challengers" screening in West Hollywood, Calif., this month.
Trend spotting in cinema is a hazardous pursuit. Think about how many times the rom-com has been declared dead -- and alive -- and dead. (No, wait, alive.) But this much can be said with surety: Hollywood is hornier than it has been in years.
"It absolutely feels like the pendulum has swung back toward filmmakers exploring adult relationships and sexuality in their projects," said Amy Pascal, the former chairwoman of Sony Pictures and producing force behind "Challengers."
"I welcome that," she added.
Eroticism used to be common in studio movies like "Challengers," which was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. "Body Heat," "Basic Instinct," "An Officer and a Gentleman," "Fatal Attraction," "Disclosure," "Cruel Intentions" and "Eyes Wide Shut" are among the many examples from the 1980s and '90s.
In the 2000s, however, film companies started to obsessively focus on PG-13 franchises and animation -- genres that could play to a global audience and sell merchandise. Studios also wanted to expand into China, where censors do not allow sex scenes. As a result, steamy storytelling began to dwindle on the big screen (except at art house theaters). Premium television picked up the slack.
Sex in mainstream movies was "pretty much gone" by 2019, as Ann Hornaday, chief film critic for The Washington Post, wrote in a column that year. A few months later, Kate Hagen, writing in Playboy magazine, found that only about 1.2 percent of films released between 2010 and 2020 contained an overt sex scene, the lowest decade total since the 1960s. (It peaked in the 1990s. Coincidentally or not, that was the decade when pornography started to become available online.)
Now, some filmmakers are pushing back.
Awards season brought "Saltburn," with its arousing-disturbing bathtub scene and Barry Keoghan's twirling, full-frontal finale. "Poor Things" found an insatiable Emma Stone romping through a Paris brothel. Christopher Nolan filmed the first sex scenes of his 35-year career for "Oppenheimer." ("More interested in the joys of sex than any recent season I can remember," as Kyle Buchanan, awards columnist for The New York Times, described the crop of contenders in February.)
Over the past year, the trickle of R-rated sex comedies in theaters turned into a relative torrent. "Anyone but You" found Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell going at it. "No Hard Feelings" starred Jennifer Lawrence as a kinda-sorta prostitute on a mission to deflower an awkward student. The libidinous "Bottoms," "Back on the Strip" and "Joy Ride" also tried mixing sex with laughs.
In late May, Mr. Powell will return to theaters in the comedic "Hit Man," about an undercover agent who begins a smoking-hot affair with a suspect, played by Adria Arjona. In addition to acting in the R-rated film, he co-wrote the screenplay with Richard Linklater and served as a producer. (It will arrive on Netflix in June.)
"'Body Heat' was one of the inspirations," Mr. Powell said in January, when "Hit Man" debuted to rave reviews at the Sundance Film Festival. "There aren't many sex scenes in movies anymore, and certainly not many that are done well."
He continued, "'Body Heat' has a lot of foreplay, which is one reason it feels so intense -- steamy, carnal." ("Body Heat," released in 1981, starred Kathleen Turner as a wealthy woman who plots the murder of her husband while having a torrid affair with a sleazy lawyer, played by William Hurt.)
The multiplex lineup for this summer includes "Deadpool & Wolverine," from Disney-owned Marvel Studios; a trailer included a joke about an intimate act involving a sex toy. (The activity "isn't new for me," Ryan Reynolds jokes as the mischievous Deadpool, "but it is for Disney.") "Blink Twice," a twisted thriller starring Channing Tatum as a mogul who lures women to a private retreat, is scheduled for release in August.
The upturn may simply be a scheduling quirk. "Challengers" was supposed to come out last year, but it was delayed because of union strikes. Its arrival now -- sandwiched between "Poor Things" and "Hit Man" -- could be creating the false appearance of a film industry turn.
But there are signs that suggest a genuine shift. One involves intimacy coordinators, or experts who help performers navigate the awkwardness of filming sex scenes. Their inclusion on sets, once a rarity, became common after the #MeToo movement of the late 2010s. Film producers say stars have become more willing to participate in simulated intimacy as a result.
Young screenwriters and directors also seem to be rediscovering movies like "American Gigolo" (1980) and "9½ Weeks" (1986) and drawing inspiration. Some studio executives say filmmakers like Luca Guadagnino, who directed "Challengers," are interested in exploring changing attitudes about sex -- as seen in the rise of OnlyFans and the shame-free embrace of sexual fluidity by younger millennials and Gen Z. (One counterpoint: In a study last year by the Center for Scholars & Storytellers at the University of California, Los Angeles, about 52 percent of respondents ages 13 to 24 said they wanted movies and TV shows to focus more on friendships and platonic relationships.)
Perhaps contributing a degree of sexual liberation: Studios have stopped chasing China, where ticket buyers have turned against Hollywood movies en masse.
So far, results at the box office have been mixed. "Anyone but You," made by Sony for $ 25 million, collected a hefty $ 219 million this year, while "Poor Things," which cost Searchlight Pictures $ 35 million, took in a solid $ 117 million. Other attempts ("Joy Ride," "No Hard Feelings") have disappointed or fizzled entirely.
Reviews for "Challengers" have been extremely positive. Box office analysts expect it to collect roughly $ 15 million in its debut weekend in the United States and Canada, where it is playing in 3,400 theaters, enough for No. 1.

C.E.O. of Paramount Could Be Out This Week As Company Eyes Merger: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He was once a staunch ally of the company's biggest owner, Shari Redstone, but the relationship soured in recent months.
Paramount is preparing to announce the departure of its chief executive, Bob Bakish, as soon as next week, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, a sudden development even as the company is exploring a merger.
The impending move is a result of Mr. Bakish's worsening relationship with Shari Redstone, the company's controlling shareholder, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a delicate matter. Ms. Redstone grew frustrated with what she saw as his inability to get important deals across the finish line, including a sale of the Showtime and BET cable channels, the people said.
Two people familiar with the matter said several of Paramount's senior executives had expressed reservations about the direction of the company to a representative of the board of directors in recent weeks, further eroding Mr. Bakish's standing with Ms. Redstone.
The company is in talks to merge with Skydance, a media company controlled by David Ellison, the tech scion and Hollywood producer. It is also negotiating a lucrative deal to keep channels like Nickelodeon and MTV on the Charter cable system.
National Amusements, Paramount's owner, is contemplating various options to replace Mr. Bakish, 60, who has led Paramount and its predecessor company, Viacom, since 2016 and has worked at the company since 1997. In one possibility, Paramount would be run by an "office of the C.E.O." led by division chiefs like Brian Robbins, the head of the Paramount movie studio; George Cheeks, the top executive of CBS; and Chris McCarthy, president of Paramount's entertainment and youth brands. The company could also choose to put an acting chief executive in place.
Paramount declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Paramount's board was considering replacing Mr. Bakish.
Like many media companies, Paramount has struggled in recent years to get its streaming business off the ground as audiences for its cable channels have deteriorated. Paramount is losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually on its streaming business, Paramount+, though its losses have slowed, and the company's share price has continued to sink as investors have become increasingly cautious about traditional media.
Because of these challenges, Paramount has long been considered an acquisition target by rivals looking to bulk up their content libraries and maximize their leverage in cable negotiations. Things began to heat up at the end of last year when Ms. Redstone referred Skydance's interest in Paramount to the company's board, which formed a special committee to consider the deal.
Paramount now is deep in talks with Skydance to shape what would be a complex deal. Ms. Redstone controls Paramount through National Amusements and has signed off on a potential deal for her stake. But Paramount's special committee must also sign off on a deal for the company.
The deal being discussed would give Ms. Redstone a big payout and Paramount shareholders stock in a new company. That structure, along with the fact that the private equity firm Apollo Global Management has been talking about teaming up with Sony in an alternative all-cash bid, has led to objections to a sale by some shareholders.
A 30-day period of exclusive talks between the two sides is set to expire in early May.
Paramount is also planning to report earnings on Monday, putting the company in a tricky spot with analysts who will be seeking an explanation for Mr. Bakish's sudden departure. Losing its chief executive is likely to invite questions from investors about the way the sales process is being handled. It could also weaken Paramount's hand in those negotiations.

Full text: This article is part of our Museums special section about how institutions are striving to offer their visitors more to see, do and feel.
The flute music was, you know, good flute music. But for the hushed audience at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art's kickoff event in February of its "Art of Noise" exhibition, the breathy scales constituted only part of the experience.
The colorful outfit belonging to the flutist (who was André 3000, by the way) was the experience, too. The crisp speakers were the experience, the smoke machine was the experience. And the two lasers passing through a glass of water balanced atop a traffic cone center stage -- André 3000 has a growing interest in traffic cones, he had announced earlier -- was the experience.
Music is music. But music is also the stuff surrounding the music.
From May 4 through Aug. 18, SFMOMA will illustrate this truism with an exhibition of visual and technological artifacts, plucked from music's low orbit. "Art of Noise" comprises more than 800 pieces -- among them early listening devices, cutting-edge speakers and iconic album covers -- loosely grouped under the heading of design. Four more sound installations generate some artful noise all their own. But the show's true subject might be our very relationship to music.
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, "The White Album," Coltrane live at Birdland: On their own, these are but air molecules vibrating across our eardrums. Music becomes sacred partly through the material culture it inspires.
And just as music shapes design -- think jazz album cover versus metal album cover -- design also codes how we hear music. In an old Xeroxed flyer for a punk show was information on how to absorb those songs; in an iconic ad for Maxell cassette tapes lurked signals about the spirit of rock.
The show opens at a funny moment. Never has music been easier to listen to -- or to ignore. Easy digital access to virtually any recording ever paradoxically diminishes our connection to all of it. Immersing oneself in a single cherished cassette for months on end, knowing the whir of the rewind button deep in the memory of a fingertip: Gone!
But gone is an invitation to reflect -- to appreciate how we got here, and to imagine what's coming.
Art meets music
"Art is how we decorate space, music is how we decorate time," Jean-Michel Basquiat is said to have remarked. But sometimes art decorates music, and nowhere was this more trippily vivid than the heyday of the psychedelic rock poster in San Francisco.
Four bright walls of these wild lithographs have been assembled here, a small shrine to a brain-melting era. Borrowing from Art Nouveau, acid trips and beyond, the posters existed to bring news of upcoming concerts; as with the space-age stereos and vintage headphones elsewhere in this exhibition, they were delivery technology. A concert promoter like Bill Graham would commission an artist to hype the upcoming Grateful Dead show and a week later, voilà. As advertisements, they were hard to read -- this filtered out the squares -- and even harder to overlook.
"The musicians were turning up their amplifiers to the point where they were blowing out your eardrums," the rock poster artist Victor Moscoso once said in an interview. "I did the equivalent with the eyeballs."
Like the Golden Gate Bridge, the '60s rock poster has become overrepresented in the popular imagination of this city. But also like the Golden Gate, it bears a closer look. There's nuance in those garish squiggles, unexpected variety from one poster to the next. And when you behold hundreds of them, cheek by swirling jowl in every imaginable color, something bigger comes into focus: a moment in time when music caused an American city to be plastered, week after week, in a new art genre all its own.
Feeling the energy
Years back, as Devon Turnbull was making a name for himself with his popular streetwear line, Nom de Guerre, he began to notice something troubling. His first love had been music -- but that new iPod in his pocket was making a casual listener of him.
"I wasn't having the meaningful experiences with music I had when I was younger. I wanted a deeper connection," Turnbull said in a phone interview.
Trained as an audio engineer, Turnbull got to work creating a new kind of sound system, one that might rekindle that connection. Working under the name Ojas and sourcing obscure parts from Japan, he built Brutalist-looking amps and speakers that soon found cult followings -- though not for their perfect fidelity.
"The way I design an audio system is not the way most high-end audio manufacturers would," he said. "I design equipment that delivers more emotional content, not necessarily better specifications."
In "HiFi Pursuit Listening Room Dream No. 2," created just for the exhibition, visitors can sink into that emotional content. Located in its own gallery, the smallish space has an austere, spaceship-like feel, but then you hear it: a stream of vinyl and reel-to-reel picks from various genres, each geared toward uncannily deep and naturalistic listening. It feels, as Turnbull put it, like, the musician's "energy is actually in the room."
"It's as if he's not building speakers so much as ears," said Joseph Becker, SFMOMA's associate curator of architecture and design and the curator of "Art of Noise."
Endless song
It was the early '80s when music and design collided to blow Jesper Kouthoofd's mind. The young Swede had beheld the civilizational leap that was the Sony Walkman, and its ability to make beloved music portable. Suddenly, impossibly, Kraftwerk could ride the bus to school with him.
Nearly half a century later, Kouthoofd makes a living blowing other minds with music and design. Teenage Engineering, the consumer electronics company he co-founded, creates futuristic synthesizers, speakers and other audio equipment. Some years back, the group came out with "Choir," a set of eight speakers in the form of wooden dolls that form a kind of algorithmically programmed chorus. The dolls displayed here in the small media gallery belt out songs from a variety of genres, from barbershop to Baroque. The robotic choir also listens to itself via Bluetooth and, using counterpoint melody, devises original improvisations, bar by bar.
"In Sweden back in the day, everyone had an organ in their homes instead of a TV," Kouthoofd said by phone. "The church organ is my favorite instrument, like the voice from God. It is very similar to my next favorite, the choir."
All religions have their own soundscape, Kouthoofd added. This soundscape, by extension, might conjure its own strange religion.
Sound on sound
One piece stands apart from the others -- literally, on the museum's second-floor outdoor landing. Against the backdrop of Natoma Street, a narrow jumble of tall and short office buildings, a mini copse of tree-ish sculptures rises. Approach these colorful metal tubes and it becomes clear they're speakers, and they're talking to us.
Or we're talking to us. From a collection of local field recordings -- church bells, foghorns, the rattle of a cable car -- the Japanese artist and musician Yuri Suzuki was commissioned to compose a remixed soundtrack of San Francisco itself. (Dedicated sound sculpture heads will be reminded of Audium, the city's pioneering sound art theater.) Using artificial intelligence, the piece combs the database of recordings for sounds with similar waveforms, then blends them into evolving patterns.
Is a city's soundscape music? Wait, what even is music? You may ponder such questions or just sit there in the fresh air, hearing. A meditative disorientation suffuses "Arborhythm," as this pastiche of urban sounds (cars, voices, random clanking) mingles with the actual urban sounds (cars, voices, random clanking) just over your shoulder.
And so you listen closer. If this is the end result -- if this is the end result of the entire exhibition -- that would be harmonious indeed.

How 'Anyone but You' Beat the Rom-Com Odds: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Here are their takeaways after the film, debuting on Netflix, went from box office miss to runaway hit.
As Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell promoted their romantic comedy, "Anyone but You," last year, life appeared to be imitating art: The co-stars posed cheek to cheek while sightseeing in Australia. Powell dipped a gleeful Sweeney in his arms. Sweeney cast longing gazes up at Powell on red carpets. The pair flirted and giggled in interviews.
When Powell and his long-term girlfriend broke up, and Sweeney remained engaged to her fiancé, Jonathan Davino (an executive producer of "Anyone but You"), rumors of an illicit offscreen relationship between the two actors took hold.
The speculation played out, the stars said, exactly as they intended.
"The two things that you have to sell a rom-com are fun and chemistry. Sydney and I have a ton of fun together, and we have a ton of effortless chemistry," Powell said in an interview. "That's people wanting what's on the screen off the screen, and sometimes you just have to lean into it a bit -- and it worked wonderfully. Sydney is very smart."
Sweeney, who is also an executive producer through her Fifty-Fifty Films company, said she was intimately involved with the marketing strategy on the Columbia Pictures film, including, perhaps, fanning those headline-generating flames.
"I was on every call. I was in text group chats. I was probably keeping everybody over at Sony marketing and distribution awake at night because I couldn't stop with ideas," she said. "I wanted to make sure that we were actively having a conversation with the audience as we were promoting this film, because at the end of the day, they're the ones who created the entire narrative."
The R-rated romance follows Bea (Sweeney) and Ben (Powell), who share a night that ends badly and are then thrust together at a destination wedding in Australia, where Ben's friend and Bea's sister are getting married. The film is based loosely on Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing" and is full of bawdy zingers, grand gestures and sun-dappled scenery.
"You've got to get the ingredients in the meal just right: the story, the cast, the filmmakers, the chemistry, the ending," said Tom Rothman, chairman and chief executive of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, which includes Columbia. He added that the execution of a romantic comedy in particular "is a delicate task. So, if you're going to make one and go for it theatrically, it better be good."
Critics were divided on "Anyone but You," and it had an anemic start at the box office. It took in about $ 8 million over the long Christmas weekend against its $ 25 million budget, and opened in fifth place behind the latest "Aquaman" and "Wonka."
"I kept my expectations low and, in retrospect, not low enough," the director Will Gluck said. "The first week was disappointing."
But then something unusual happened: The audience for "Anyone but You" grew in its second and third weeks, and the film remained in the Top 5 at the U.S. box office each weekend through the end of January, thanks in part to multiple viewings by younger audiences. Sales also surged overseas, even in non-English-language markets, which are notoriously difficult for Hollywood comedies to crack.
Sony kept the film in U.S. theaters through February, and by the time "Anyone but You" arrives on Netflix this week as part of Sony's licensing deal with the streamer, the rom-com will have grossed more than $ 218 million worldwide.
While Rothman said that Sony "never really subscribed to the notions of the punditocracy that the rom-com was dead" at the box office, the studio put only a single, low-budget romantic comedy ("The Broken Hearts Gallery") into wide release between 2016 and 2022.
Here are three takeaways from the film's success.
The actors contributed off-camera, too.
The film's journey began in earnest in early 2022, when Sweeney, a star of "Euphoria" and "Immaculate," was actively seeking rom-com scripts to act in and produce. She and the producer Jeff Kirschenbaum came across one by Ilana Wolpert, a screenwriter best known at the time for "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series."
"Ilana took such a cool, modern twist on Shakespeare, I felt like I was reading an early 2000s rom-com," Sweeney said of the script. "I loved wanting to be kissed in the rain, wanting to fall in love once I finished reading the script, wanting to cry, laugh, feeling all the feels."
Sweeney spent months meeting with potential lead actors and had narrowed it down to two or three others before meeting Powell at the MTV Movie & TV Awards. After a follow-up video call with him, she said she was convinced the actor, best known then for "Top Gun: Maverick," "had all the chops" to play Ben.
The stars then approached Gluck, whose credits include "Easy A" and "Friends With Benefits" at Sony, to direct and revise the script as they shopped it to studios. Within a matter of weeks, Sony snapped up the project -- a feat Sweeney partly attributed to her "building a great relationship" with the studio by acting in the superhero movie "Madame Web."
"Sydney is a force of nature," Rothman said, adding that Sony is lucky to be in business with her on future projects, which include a new "Barbarella."
Ahead of the release of "Anyone but You," Sweeney said she pushed Sony to take "a leap of faith" and release a viral promo clip of her and Powell whispering raunchy "ASMR pickup lines" that has since been viewed nearly 25 million times on TikTok. And after the film hit theaters, Sweeney noticed a handful of TikToking moviegoers lip-syncing and dancing to the Natasha Bedingfield song "Unwritten" -- which plays a key role in the film -- and fueled the trend by sharing their clips with her nearly 20 million Instagram followers.
"I was like, this is really interesting, so I saved that and I storied that," Sweeney said, referring to Instagram's Stories feature. "Before I knew it, I was doing it every single night. It just spiraled into this thing that created a TikTok trend, and that is truly what built the audience."
Rom-com history matters.
For Dermot Mulroney, the veteran actor who plays a supporting role as Bea's father in "Anyone but You," being part of the film's success is a full-circle moment. He was in his early 30s when he starred in the 1997 rom-com "My Best Friend's Wedding," which made almost $ 300 million globally against its $ 35 million budget. Yet, Mulroney, who played the object of Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz's affections in that hit, found he had few opportunities in the immediate aftermath.
"I was sitting there ready for the gift with purchase that was supposed to come along with being in a popular movie, and instead, I probably didn't work for a year," Mulroney said. "I chalked it up to me being so tiny on the poster, the little guy on the cake. I thought, gosh, you guys, if you'd made me a little bigger, maybe I could have gotten a job."
But Mulroney, now 60, said he was still approached daily by fans of the film -- decades after its release -- some of whom tell him they grew up watching it with their grandmothers.
The night before filming began on "Anyone but You" in Sydney, Gluck gathered the cast to watch "My Best Friend's Wedding" at a Sony screening room. It was the first time Mulroney had seen it since its premiere; afterward he spoke to the room, and Powell in particular, about the unexpected weight of being in a theatrical rom-com.
"I didn't want him to do what I did, which was minimize how important something is that might feel a little light or a little fluff when you're doing it," Mulroney said. "'What these movies mean to people,' I told Glen, 'will last for decades.' It will last until after you're gone in a way that maybe the other cool stuff he's doing won't. It has a different kind of absorption."
Powell took the message to heart and also relished the chance to embrace the goofier aspects of playing the love interest in a romantic comedy.
"For some reason, the rom-com male lead has just been reduced to a brooding male model that occasionally smiles at the girl across the room," Powell said. "But for me, if you're a male and you leave a rom-com looking cool, you've totally messed it up."
Gluck agreed. "We were very conscious of making it feel like a huge movie with big production and big escapism and big moments and big acts of love," he said, adding, "a lot of life's moments are cheesy and cringe."
Don't expect Hollywood to learn these lessons.
Gluck said he has had talks with Sweeney and Powell about reteaming on another film. And while Rothman said there has been "nothing official" discussed at the studio level, he would prefer to see the actors pair up again in an unrelated romantic comedy, similar to Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's filmography together.
"Not that we wouldn't consider a sequel -- obviously, we would," Rothman said. "But I think maybe the healthiest opportunity is another original starring the two of them."
Mulroney said he and Roberts have discussed ways they could reunite in another rom-com. "I'd give anything to go around again with Julia," he said. "We're trying, for sure. We'll do whatever anybody can get up and going."
Still, Gluck is skeptical that the success of "Anyone but You" will herald a new wave of theatrical rom-coms. (Universal recently announced that its fourth "Bridget Jones" film will go straight to Peacock in the United States next year.)
"There's one thing I know for certain: Nothing will be learned from this," Gluck said. "I hope I'm wrong, but it's not like, in six months get ready for a rom-com revolution every weekend. I still think people are a little hesitant to figure out why it worked."

Full text: Musicians, writers and others on the work that started it all for them -- and on what, if anything, they'd change about it now.
Amy Tan, 72, writer, on "The Joy Luck Club" (1989)
I was a business writer [of marketing materials for companies and brochures for their employees] in the mid-1980s and, even though I was successful, I was unhappy. I wasn't doing anything meaningful. Writing fiction allowed me, through subterfuge, to access emotional realms that I hadn't explored before. When you write your first novel, you tend to include a lot of autobiographical elements. "The Joy Luck Club" [about the lives of four Chinese immigrant women and their American-born daughters] became deeply personal without my knowing it. I wasn't consciously writing about racism or generational divides, even though that's exactly what I was writing about. At that time [Tan was 37 when the book came out], I was just trying to find a story.
People got all kinds of things out of it. They said it saved their marriage or helped their relationships. I felt wonderful about that, but I couldn't take credit. I didn't intend to write a book that was going to improve people's lives. That would've been a noble pursuit but, to do that, I'd have had to come up with a book that was very different -- less spontaneous and honest. Without a doubt, what made me proudest was that my mother read it. She wasn't proficient in English, but she understood it more than anybody else. -- L.G.
Avril Lavigne, 39, musician, on "Let Go" (2002)
I remember going into the studio and people trying to tell me what to do or how my music should be, but I knew what I wanted to create. "Let Go" reflects how I felt as a young girl coming into the music industry. I was 15 when I got signed and 16 when I made that album. I had all this angst and rebellion, and I wanted to be expressive in that tone. But the adults around me kept delivering cheesy song ideas, and I wasn't feeling the way people were playing the guitar. It was all too light and fluffy; that's the stuff that made me run.
When I went to Los Angeles and connected with [the album's co-writers Lauren Christy, Graham Edwards and Scott Spock of] the Matrix and Clif Magness, they were way cooler and more open-minded. Lauren and I spent a lot of time together. I sat with her in the backyard on a picnic blanket writing "Complicated"; we really connected. I was finally understood. The production was a little poppy for me. If I had to redo the album today, I'd tweak some things here and there production-wise and apply some of my experience from the past 20 years. Still, the important songs like "Sk8er Boi" and "Complicated" rocked enough -- they had the live guitar and drums -- and "I'm With You" wasn't too polished. On songs like "Unwanted" and "Losing Grip," we really went all the way -- no holding back. -- L.G.
Chloë Sevigny, 49, actress, on "Kids" (1995)
I still find the marketing around "Kids" [about a day in the life of some wayward New York City teenagers] a little outrageous: "The most shocking film of the year!" "A must-see!" But it worked. A lot of us making it thought of it as a cautionary tale, but so many kids have come up to me and said, "That's why I moved to New York. I wanted to live that life." I was an amateur [at 19, when I made the film]. I knew the cinematographer, Eric Alan Edwards. He'd shot [Gus Van Sant's 1991 movie] "My Own Private Idaho," and I thought the acting in that was impeccable. I trusted that if something [in my performance] was false, he'd say something. I don't know why, but I just gave myself over to [Edwards and the director, Larry Clark]; I trusted that they wanted to get to the truth of things.
The hardest scene for me to shoot was when [my character, 15-year-old Jennie] is at the clinic receiving information that she'd contracted H.I.V. I thought, "How does one even begin to try to act that?" I was very tentative. If I were to approach that scene now, I think I'd have the confidence to try more things -- one take crying, others doing this and that. At the time, I was trying to be as real as I thought I could be on camera with a crew around me.
I'm surprised that "Kids" is still making such an impact, but I'm also not. Afterward, I thought, "OK, this set a bar. These are the kinds of people I want to work with." -- N.A.
Stephen King, 76, writer, on "Carrie" (1974)
One of my rules about writing is similar to a rule in [the card game] Hearts: If it's laid, it's played. I have a tendency not to go back and reread things, particularly with "Carrie" [a horror novel about a bullied high school student capable of telekinesis]. I'm afraid of how naïve it may be, how much it might be the work of a very young writer. It's like when you're a kid and you don't know how to behave. You look back on certain things and say, "I shouldn't have grabbed that," or, "That wasn't polite." I don't want to go back and see that my shirttail was untucked or my fly was unzipped.
I'd change a lot. It would have a little more depth when it came to the characters. Remember, it started as a short story. I had this idea about a girl with paranormal powers who was going to get revenge on the girls who made fun of her. It was too long for the markets that I had in mind, and I didn't know very much about girls anyway, particularly girls' gym classes and locker rooms, so I threw the story away. My wife fished it out of the trash, uncrumpled the pages, looked at it and said, "This is pretty good. I'll help you." It's a very short book, way under 300 pages. Also, there are pejoratives that were common then that I wouldn't use now, even though they're realistic and come out of the mouths of characters we don't like. On the whole, I must've done a fairly good job because the book was published [when I was 26] and [in 1976] they made a movie out of it.
One of the things I think about a lot was that my mother got to read it. She had cancer at that point and died before any of my other books were published. Because of "Carrie," I had a chance to take care of her and get her in a hospice. By then we had the money, otherwise we would've been out of luck. -- L.G.
Andrew Holleran, 79, writer, on "Dancer From the Dance" (1978)
"Dancer" has had a life of its own, which I could've never predicted. I wrote the book at my parents' house in Florida one winter [when I was 33]. It was going to be the last book I ever wrote, because I'd been writing for 10 years after graduating from an M.F.A. program and had only had one story published in a magazine. I said to myself, "You have to stop now and go to law school." Luckily, the book came out of me very quickly and, in retrospect, became a description of six years I'd spent in New York. It was very easy because I'd obviously touched something that mattered to me.
I've never reread "Dancer" [about gay life in 1970s New York] so, while I'm sure that if I did, I'd revise, revise, revise, I can't imagine changing any of it. The campy style of the letters that frame the book is probably outdated, which is a shame since I love camp.
I've learned since then that writing is basically unconscious, and you don't get any smarter about it. Imagine a brain surgeon who didn't learn from each operation? We'd be horrified. But when you sit down to write, you're always wondering how to do it. -- L.G.
Debbie Harry, 78, and Chris Stein, 74, musicians, on "Blondie" (1976)
Debbie Harry: We recorded "Blondie" [when Harry was 30 and Stein was 25] in a studio used by jazz musicians, and there wasn't a lot of fancy recording technique. It was a different era. I think the fact that the album wasn't overproduced gives it a kind of timelessness. We still perform some of those songs. Every once in a while, we drag up "X Offender" and "Rip Her to Shreds."
Our music wasn't just about one style or sound; we had songs that expressed different feelings and attitudes in music. A lot of things, like "Man Overboard" [a danceable heartbreak track], we really didn't pull off the way I think Chris wanted to, but it's there.
Chris Stein: That song would've worked fantastic with a dembow beat [but I wasn't introduced to reggaeton until years later]. If I were to change anything about the album, it'd have more to do with the production than what we were slapping on the tape. Generally, we'd just go in and do a bunch of takes, pick the best one, throw some stuff on it and that was pretty much it. There was hardly any overdubbing. We learned so much from the producer Mike Chapman a couple of years later -- the difference between "Blondie" and our later albums was like night and day.
Still, I like "Blondie." It represents how we felt at the time and what was happening to us. When I look back on it, I think of the whole downtown milieu and a period in New York that I don't know if anyone thought we'd be talking about 50 years later. -- L.G.
Zadie Smith, 48, writer, on "White Teeth" (2000)
I love the joy in my novel "White Teeth" [a multigenerational story of race and identity among the residents of London's Willesden neighborhood], even though I haven't picked it up in 25 years. Back then [Smith was 24 when the book came out], I was trying to write about people; I was interested in the interpersonal above all else. The people in the neighborhood I came from were always described in a manner of pathology, and I was trying to explain that we weren't pathological. I was always writing around this kind of elephant in the room, which is what you know people have already assumed about your characters. As I've gotten older, I've had to do less of that because I've got company. There are so many writers from so many countries, particularly in West Africa, [that] I wanted to see as a child.
I've become more interested in power lately. I'm very aware of being like the Ancient Mariner, that the structures I'm talking about that made life not always pathological have vanished. The conditions of the characters in "White Teeth" -- their decent health care, their reasonable housing, their free university education -- are gone. I'm still on the side of joy, but the question is, what kind of structures allow people to experience it. As I've gotten older, I write about them not out of nostalgia but out of political urgency. -- L.G.
Maya Lin, 64, sculptor, on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (1982) in Washington, D.C.
It was a battle to keep the Vietnam Veterans Memorial simple and spare. I was moved by World War I memorials built by the French and British. They offered a much more realistic and sobering look at the high price of war, which is human life. When I went to the site [of what would become the monument] on Thanksgiving break [in 1980, when I was 20 and in my junior year at Yale], I felt a need to cut the earth and open it up. The structure isn't so much an object inserted into the earth; it's the earth itself being polished like a geode. I considered everything, even the walkway, which was put in to intentionally separate the wall from the ground. If you put the granite sidewalk all the way up against the wall, it would no longer be a polished geode -- it'd be a curb. I put grass there. But no one could have predicted how popular it would be, so people trampled the grass and it died.
A year or two after the memorial was built, unbeknown to me, the architects of record worked with [the National] Park Service to put in [Belgian blocks on either side of the granite path]. That needs to be rethought because it's an ugly detail. They're out of scale. It drives me crazy every time I see it. -- L.G.
Tracy Chapman, 60, musician, on "Tracy Chapman" (1988)
I had this notion when I first started writing songs that to respect the muse -- or whatever source of inspiration brought me to put pen to paper -- I shouldn't do any editing. The first thing that came to me was meant to be. "Talkin' Bout a Revolution," which I wrote when I was 16, emerged from that mind-set. It was one of those songs that came out in one sitting. It's a very forceful declaration.
A song like "Fast Car," which I wrote when I was maybe 22, wasn't a very long process, but it reflected a different strategy about songwriting. It was more about revelation, sharing a story about a person and the changes happening in their life. I made edits to "Fast Car." I definitely changed words and lines. I'm too embarrassed to tell you exactly what, but it was the verse that starts "See, my old man's got a problem." Let's just say that there was something else there.
In some ways, writing a song is about asking and answering questions: "Who is this character, why are they doing this and where is the story going?" When I was young, I thought all these questions could be answered with the first iteration of the song. I'm not as enamored with this idea that the very first thing that comes to mind is what I have to remain committed to. -- L.G.
Jewel, 49, musician, on "Pieces of You" (1995)
What's important to me about "Pieces of You" is that I made an honest album. I liked [the writers] Charles Bukowski and Anaïs Nin because they told the truth about themselves, and it wasn't always pretty. With my work, my goal was to be just as honest. "Pieces of You" wasn't more developed than I was -- I didn't know how to play with a band, and I didn't choose a producer who'd make me sound slicker or lend their experience to make me sound more polished. I wanted it to be a snapshot of who I was [between 16 and 19]: inexperienced, emotionally charged and trying to figure life out.
Writing was medicine for me. I had extreme anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia. I wrote songs to calm myself down and to help me fall asleep at night. I never wrote them thinking I'd have a career. There wasn't really a craft -- it was more about what comforted me, what suited me, what interested me to think and write about. I was an avid reader, and a lot of my writing took after Flannery O'Connor, [John] Steinbeck and [Anton] Chekhov, like short stories put to music.
I remember writing at that age that I didn't want my music to be my best work of art -- I wanted my life to be my best work of art. I take music seriously, but I take that promise to myself more seriously. -- L.G.

Surprisingly Frank And Disquietingly Coy: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Restored to its original length and screening at the Museum of Modern Art, this 1933 movie starring Spencer Tracy feels at once surprisingly frank and disquietingly coy.
A celebrant of redemptive love, Frank Borzage (1893-1962) was the most romantic of classic Hollywood directors and, however unconventionally, perhaps the most religious as well. "Man's Castle" (1933) conflates an economic crisis -- namely the Great Depression -- with a spiritual one. The movie also represents premarital pregnancy as salvation rather than sin, and scenes were consequently cut for its post-Production Code rerelease in the late 1930s.
Restored to its original length of 78 minutes, screening at the Museum of Modern Art (April 18-24), "Man's Castle" feels unique -- at once surprisingly frank and disquietingly coy.
A leading director of silent films, Borzage (Bor-ZAY-ghee) left the Fox studio and went independent in 1932. His first production was an adaptation of Hemingway's World War I novel "A Farewell to Arms." "Man's Castle" also concerns love in extremis with the starving innocent Trina (20-year-old Loretta Young) falling for and shacking up with an older if equally indigent man of the world, Bill (Spencer Tracy).
Their meet-cute on a park bench, with Bill feeding the pigeons as ravenous Trina looks longingly on, proceeds to a nice restaurant (where Bill gets out of paying the check) and winds up back at his jerry-built hovel in a homeless encampment near the East River. A natural man, Bill amazes Trina (and possibly the viewer) by diving naked into the water. She more discreetly follows. Cut from Edenic skinny-dipping to radiant Trina at the washboard happily scrubbing Bill's clothes.
A brash roughneck with a golden heart, Bill inspires Trina's puppy-like devotion. In his New York Times review, Mordaunt Hall praised the stars' "thoroughly efficient portrayals" -- an odd choice of words to describe their evident mutual attraction. Indeed, the chemistry was real. Young's daughter would later detail the pair's guilt-ridden love affair. (Both were Catholic; Tracy was married.)
For Trina, Bill's Hooverville home is "heaven," with various down-and-out denizens adding to the allegorical flavor. Bragg (Arthur Hohl) is not only a lech and a thief but a leftist loudmouth. His alcoholic companion, Flossie (Marjorie Rambeau), is both a fallen woman and a salvation project tended to by a former minister (Walter Connolly). Dismissive of all three, the cynical Bill is tempted by the fun-loving cabaret star Fay La Rue (a reliably sassy Glenda Farrell, here mimicking Mae West).
Topical yet timeless, "Man's Castle" sets its characters in the world of popular culture. A theater marquee glimpsed when Trina and Bill first meet advertises George Raft and Sylvia Sidney in the movie "Pick Up" (1933). Bill's kiss-off missive to Faye is a word cut out from a piece of sheet music. Trina explains herself by citing a song from "Show Boat." At the same time, the movie evokes scripture -- the Song of Songs and tale of the Nativity -- ending as Trina and Bill hit the road with intimations of a December birth, perhaps even in a manger.
MoMA is showing "Man's Castle" in conjunction with four other Borzage restorations -- the misleadingly titled "Bad Girl" (1931), the antiwar "No Greater Glory" (1934), the genre-mixing "History is Made at Night" (1937) and the late-career "Moonrise" (1949), a low-budget hillbilly noir later championed by auteurist critics. When this "glorious opportunity" to make a complex, guilt-shadowed redemptive love story presented itself, the critic Andrew Sarris would write, "Borzage was not stale or jaded." Neither is "Man's Castle."

Dreams Beyond a Broken-Down Housing Tower: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Minhal Baig's third feature follows two boys living in a public housing complex in Chicago as they cope by building their own dream worlds.
The two boys in the gauzy nostalgia piece "We Grown Now" are total charmers. They're also worryingly vulnerable, something you clock soon after the movie opens. Set in 1992, it takes place primarily in Cabrini-Green, at the time a public housing development in Chicago. There, the boys frolic and dream amid cinder block walls. Every so often, they wander outside to the concrete playground and to a jumble of old mattresses that the local kids use as cushioning. One boy likes to vault through the air and onto the mattresses; he likes to fly.
The two boys are around 10 years old, and the closest of friends. They live in the same broken-down tower building, one of several in the complex, where sometimes they hang out in an abandoned apartment. There, they like to talk and stare at the stained and cracked ceiling, conjuring up visions from it the way they might do under the sheltering dome of the sky. Malik (Blake Cameron James) turns out to be an especially dreamy child, a pint-size philosopher who lives with his loving mother (Jurnee Smollett), doting grandma (S. Epatha Merkerson) and sister (Madisyn Barnes), a typical if benign sibling thorn in his side.
For his part, Malik's best friend, the more prosaically drawn Eric (Gian Knight Ramirez), lives with his older sister (Avery Holliday) and their father (Lil Rel Howery), a kindly fount of praise and disappointment. The friendship between Eric and Malik -- the child performers are dear -- is one of the truest parts of the movie, and it's easy to fall quickly into step with them as they wander Cabrini, head to school and one day briefly escape from their routine. Bored one day while in class, the boys jump on a train and eventually make it to the Art Institute of Chicago, where they roam its galleries, at one point pausing before Walter Ellison's striking painting "Train Station," a 1935 canvas that depicts a segregated terminal.
Their interest in the painting is easy to believe: It's beautiful, arresting and at once familiar and mysterious (as the child of a former museum guard, I can relate). At the same time, like so much of this movie, the scene also feels forced, partly because the writer-director Minhal Baig's expressionistic reveries don't always fit with the issues she recurrently invokes. When the boys run through the museum, the other patrons remain frozen in place, as if they were in a different dimension. Yet when Malik connects the painting to his grandmother's home in Mississippi, he opens a window onto a profound history that's too heavy for this otherwise fanciful scene. He also sounds more like a filmmaking conceit than a child, however wise.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This is the third feature movie that Baig has directed, and it certainly has qualities to appreciate. As she demonstrated in her second, "Hala" (2019), about a Pakistani American teenager navigating the divide between her parents' lives and her blossoming desires, Baig knows how to create sympathetic characters. You're immediately invested in Malik and Eric, who together have formed a private world that, like the museum, exists apart from real life, its pressures and its dangers. The sound design is particularly effective at conveying the little bubble that the children have created for themselves. The babble of outside voices and music in Cabrini never seems to stop flowing, but you never really hear what anyone says.
At one point, the real world does catastrophically pierce the boys' bubble when a near-army of police descend on the complex in the wake of a shooting, ransacking homes and turning residents into suspects. This violence gives the story dramatic tension, creating a crisis in Malik's life when his mother considers moving elsewhere. The police raid also widens his (and the movie's) horizons when he learns that his grandparents moved to Cabrini to escape the violence in their Southern hometown. Some of this is effective, even if too many of Baig's filmmaking choices -- the honeyed cinematography, the score's agitated violins and Malik's preternaturally knowing voice-over -- finally overwhelm the story's fragile lyrical realism.
We Grown Now
Rated PG for images of police violence. Running time 1 hour 33 minutes. In theaters.

Musical Riches Are Waiting to Be Found: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: For decades, recordings left at studios have languished in storage rooms and basements. Master Tape Rescue, a company of two industry vets, is coming to save them.
In late 2020, Brian Kehew was working at the venerable Hollywood studio Sunset Sound when the owner asked him to help identify some tapes the Who had left behind. It was not an unusual request for Kehew, who has done tape transfers and mixes on hundreds of archival recording projects over the last 30 years, and serves as a tech and sometime backing musician for the band. He expected to find some overdubs or a safety copy of a master, nothing particularly important.
When he got his hands on the reels, he was shocked: The studio was sitting on all the original two-inch multitracks of the group's 1975 album, "The Who by Numbers," as well as previously unreleased songs from those sessions.
"I immediately contacted Pete Townshend, and we arranged to send the tapes back to England," Kehew, a blond-haired Southern California native, said in a recent interview at his North Hollywood studio, which was lined with rare, vintage and obsolete tape machines. "The band had been looking for the tapes for years, but this was one place they hadn't thought to check."
For Kehew, a producer of Fiona Apple's "Extraordinary Machine" and an expert on both the Beatles and Moog synthesizers, the recovery of the Who recordings underscored the fact that significant tapes "might be sitting in someone's attic or barn or basement" and not where they belong, in a record company vault or an artist's archive. "The obstacle to getting these tapes back in the right hands has always been the time and effort involved," he said. "But what if there was a facile way to connect everyone that doesn't involve a lot of hassle or red tape?"
The answer may be Master Tape Rescue, a company recently started by Kehew and his partner, Danny White, a fellow music industry veteran. The company acts as an archival matchmaking service of sorts, cataloging recordings from studios or private collections and then vetting and connecting rights holders with tape holders.
Over the past six months, as Kehew, 59, and White, 57, have canvassed the vaults of various studios and other holdings, they have discovered a wealth of fascinating material: previously unreleased Jimi Hendrix jam sessions, unknown Billie Holiday tapes, a trove of historic Chicago blues material, a large collection of professional concert recordings from artists including David Bowie, R.E.M. and Iggy Pop. "And it feels like that's just the tip of the iceberg," White said.
It was another historic discovery that brought White -- a lanky, Indiana-born musician, studio owner and president of Sound Techniques, a recording console maker -- into the project. In the late 2000s, he backed the Buddy Holly guitarist Tommy Allsup on tour. In 2009, inspired by the experience, he wrote a young adult novel, "The Last Rock and Roll Show," about a pair of kids who discover lost Holly recordings. Life would imitate art when White was hired by the estate of a former Holly producer to assess its tape archive -- and discovered more than 20 first-generation masters by the "Peggy Sue" singer.
Holly's catalog was among the recordings reported to have been destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire, which came to wide public knowledge in 2019. The find was major, showing that not everything was lost in the blaze. "It's not all of Buddy's masters," White said, "but it's a big chunk of his catalog, which is significant given the circumstances. And this was all sitting in a closet for years."
In cases like the Who or Holly, there is real financial value in the recovered tapes. But most lost recordings, even ones from name acts, may be worth only a few hundred or thousand dollars. "Even though you have a tape, you don't own the rights to what's on it, so you can't expect the moon," Kehew said. "Labels might pay a small licensing fee use to a tape or track for a boxed set, sometimes they'll buy it outright. Usually, they offer a finder's fee or a storage fee -- like, here's a reward for preserving our tape all this time. It scales up and down with the artist, and how special the material is."
But White said money isn't the point: "We're doing this more out of a sense of history, and hopefully help find some cool stuff that's just been collecting dust for decades."
NEARLY EVERY STUDIO that operated in the peak era of analog recording from the 1950s to the early 2000s has a locker, vault or room dedicated to housing tapes left behind by artists and labels.
Historically, finished album masters -- held on a single quarter-inch tape reel, from which commercial copies would be manufactured -- were considered the most valued asset. The multitracks -- heavy, cumbersome two-inch reels of tape, containing the individual elements of the recording -- would typically be collected and delivered to the label after a session. But inevitably a small percentage of tapes landed in the studio's on-site storage, often forgotten completely by the artist and record company.
Paul Camarata, who owns Sunset Sound, watched his entire second-story space fill floor to ceiling with tapes like this, more than 1,500 at last count, from the big-band leader Harry James to the 1980s hitmakers Toto, before calling in Master Tape Rescue. "I'm always thinking we gotta get these tapes out of here," he said. "But we're in a strange quandary -- we don't own the tapes, and I would never just throw them away. We've just become an unwitting storage service."
Over the years, record companies have "come down and scoured our archives hoping to find some gold," he said. "But it's kind of like leaving your car at the mechanic for 40 years and just expecting to pick it up one day."
In 2010, Clay Blair began operating the Boulevard Recording Studio in Hollywood. It came with an illustrious history: Opened as Continental Recorders in 1966, it morphed into Producer's Workshop in the 1970s (turning out projects by Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac and Steely Dan) and eventually became Westbeach Recorders, the pop-punk stronghold whose clients included Blink-182, Rancid and the Offspring. When Blair took over the space, he inherited a disused echo chamber that had been turned into a tape storage.
"There's at least a couple hundred tapes in there that go all the way back to the '60s," said Blair, who is also working with Master Tape Rescue. "There are recordings by Liberace and Engelbert Humperdinck, a score for an Evel Knievel film, we found a Jerry Garcia tape from the '70s, a soundtrack he did that's never been released. Just the other day, we found the two-inch reels from Concrete Blonde's hit 'Joey.' There's all kinds of stuff hiding in these studios that nobody has any idea about."
Still, numerous recording facilities that have been sold or closed over the years simply threw out their archives. The most famous example is Olympic Studios in London, which in 1987 took its entire tape inventory -- including incredibly valuable multitrack recordings by bands like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin -- and placed them in a dumpster. Enterprising collectors salvaged as many reels as possible; some were reunited with the artists, others turned up as bootlegs.
Historically, multitrack recordings were seen as less valuable than finished master tapes. Back in the 1960s, bands would often roll back over recorded performances for fresh takes, or labels would bulk erase reels after a session and reuse the tape for other projects. "A lot of great, interesting recordings got lost that way," said Andrew Sandoval, a reissue producer who has specialized in catalog work for '60s groups like the Monkees and the Beach Boys.
Sandoval said that even major artists of the era, like the Kinks, have very few of their early multis. "You're never going to hear alternate takes of classics like 'You Really Got Me' or 'All of the Day,"' he said. "None of those things exist."
During the 1970s and '80s, multitracks were haphazardly stored, organized and prized, even by major labels. It wasn't uncommon to walk into a place like Coast Recording Equipment Supply, a pro audio shop in Hollywood, and find used reels being sold for recording that contained multitrack masters by bands like the Doors.
It wasn't until the CD era and the explosion of deep-dive compilations and boxed sets in the late '80s and early '90s that record companies started to fully realize the value of their multitracks. "When you get into the re-marketing of music and creating reissues, the first thing a label asks is: 'Is there something new here?"' Sandoval said. "In order to find or create something new, you usually need to go back to the multitracks -- that's your biggest source of alternate takes, outtakes and unreleased material."
Today, multitracks arguably hold even more value thanks to the rise of remix projects, the development of immersive audio formats like Dolby Atmos, and even TV, film and commercial sync opportunities, which often require use of the original recording elements.
"The ability to recast an artist's music, to present it in a new way, usually depends on the multitracks," said John Jackson, the longtime Sony/Legacy A&R executive. Now running his own consultancy, advising Billy Joel, Rosanne Cash and the estate of AC/DC's Bon Scott, he noted that "if you don't have the multitracks or have a plan for the multitracks, you're not recognizing and celebrating the value of that artist's music fully."
THERE'S NO QUESTION that the vagaries of the music business have claimed plenty of important recordings over the years.
In February, the 146-track boxed set "Written in Their Soul: The Stax Songwriter Demos" won best historical album at the Grammys. Chronicling the tunesmiths behind the iconic Memphis soul label, it was a 20-year passion project for its producer, Cheryl Pawelski. A former catalog executive at Capitol and Warner Music who now runs her own label, Omnivore, Pawelski said the original tapes that make up the Stax box had actually been thrown out years earlier.
"Fortunately, before they got rid of the tapes sometime in the '90s, the publisher that owned the material transferred it all to DAT," said Pawelski, referring to the now outdated digital tape format. "That's because a single DAT could hold 90 or 120 minutes -- it was a space saving measure."
Pawelski knows that "Written in Their Soul" is a feel-good story in a business often filled with dispiriting tales of lost history. "God knows what's been thrown out. Just thinking about the stuff that probably wound up in landfills in Memphis or Chicago, it makes me very sad," she said. "As music lovers, as reissue producers, we're chasing something that's very ephemeral in what is essentially a business environment. And I think a lot of music has gotten the raw end of those business dealings."
Corporate neglect and studio closures aren't the only reasons tapes get lost or go missing; there have been more nefarious forces at work as well. Jackson, who spent years overseeing Sony/Legacy's work on the Elvis Presley catalog, noted that even the biggest artists have not been immune from having their recordings stolen.
The Presley archivist Ernst Jorgensen spent "decades putting Elvis's whole tape collection back together," Jackson said. "And a lot of times that involved someone saying, 'Meet me at this motel behind Graceland and I'll sell you the multitracks of this session."'
A few years ago, Kehew worked on a reissue of a 20-times-platinum LP by a big major-label act from the 1990s. He noticed the multitracks were not in the label's vault, but since those tapes weren't needed for the project, he thought little of it. A few months later, he was approached by someone who had inherited a store of tapes and wanted him to assess the contents. There, among the mostly worthless reels, were "the multitracks for this 20-million-selling album," Kehew said, "just sitting in a dusty garage in downtown L.A., next to some boots and a bunch of oil cans."
Someone had checked out the tapes from the label without a signature, he said, later abandoning them. "The label was very happy to have them back. The band probably never even knew they were missing."
Sandoval believes the untapped holdings of studios and private collections could produce a bounty in the coming years. "There's recordings people have been sitting on for one reason or another," he said. "As those folks pass away, and their families find and inherit the tapes, that stuff is finally going to surface."
Kehew and White are counting on that and hope to streamline the process through their efforts with Master Tape Rescue. "I do believe there are hundreds of studios all over the world that have tape vaults that are worth exploring," Kehew said. "Or that there are producers or engineers, or estates, who might have material of real value for artists or labels. A lot of stuff is still out there -- it's just a matter of finding it."

1970s Hit Resonates As Paean To a Drug: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The diabetes drug has become a phenomenon, and "Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic!" -- a takeoff of the Pilot song "Magic" -- has played a big part in its story.
In February 2023, David Paton, guitar case in hand, strode across the most famous pedestrian walkway in rock history and into London's Abbey Road Studios.
Paton was no stranger to the rooms where the Beatles changed the course of popular music: His 1970s pop-rock band Pilot recorded two albums there. In his second life, as an in-demand studio and touring musician for the likes of Kate Bush and Elton John, he clocked numerous sessions with the prog-rock outfit the Alan Parsons Project, whose namesake produced Pilot's signature hit, "Magic." He even spent some time there with his boyhood hero, Paul McCartney, singing backup vocals on Wings' "Mull of Kintyre."
Paton had come to London to record a new version of "Magic." "It was a great thrill to be back at Abbey Road, singing my song," he said in a recent video interview from his home studio in Edinburgh, an array of guitars displayed behind him. The track's stair-step chorus -- "Oh, oh, oh/it's MAAA-gic" -- could test Paton's vocal range even back in 1974, and again a year later, when the song became a worldwide hit, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.
"It's just about the enjoyment of life," he said. "About waking up in the morning, you know? I was 22 when I wrote it." Now he was 73, and unsure if he could still reach those high notes. But Paton took his place in front of the Abbey Road microphone and confidently sang that indelible hook, only with the word "magic" swapped out for something less ephemeral and more pharmaceutical: "Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As television viewers are all too aware, that altered chorus from "Magic" serves as the advertising jingle for the Type 2 diabetes medication Ozempic. Since the product arrived in 2018, the bowdlerized version of "Magic" -- first rerecorded by work-for-hire musicians, and then re-rerecorded by Paton at Abbey Road -- has taken its place alongside such classics of the form as Subway's "Five Dollar Foot Long" and McDonald's "I'm Lovin' It" as marvels of marketing ingenuity.
"It's an earworm all right," said David Allan, a professor of marketing at Saint Joseph's University and the author of "This Note's for You," a book about music and advertising. "You can't get it out of your head."
Those three seconds of AM-radio bliss -- "It's just a first, a third and a fifth note," Paton modestly explained -- have played a pivotal role in the Ozempic story. Its parent company, Novo Nordisk, has now become Europe's most valuable public company, with a market cap of nearly $ 570 billion.
Ozempic, of course, has become much more than a diabetes drug: Its "off label" use to treat obesity has sparked a "weight-loss revolution," as Oprah Winfrey called it in her March TV special dedicated to an emerging group of diabetes and anti-obesity medications. Buttressed by an ad spend of $ 120 million over just the first seven months of 2023, according to MediaRadar, Ozempic's Q rating is such that the brand now stands in for an entire category of product, as Viagra does for erectile dysfunction drugs. On the March 30 episode of "Saturday Night Live," the comedian Ramy Youssef appeared in a spoof commercial for "Ozempic for Ramadan" that featured the familiar "Oh, oh, oh" of "Magic."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This Ozempic boom is due in no small part to the jingle, which helped turn a byzantine mash-up of syllables into a brand patients would request from doctors by name. Jeremy Shepler, who headed the Ozempic launch in the United States for Novo Nordisk, had previously enjoyed success deploying music in a commercial for a new-to-market nasal spray, and knew he wanted to find a song that worked both mnemonically and emotionally.
"The first song I came up with was by New Kids on the Block, the one that goes 'Oh oh oh oh oh'," he sang, referring to "You Got It (The Right Stuff)." "But New Kids was a bit too young," he said. "The average age of our patient was between 50 and 55. Then it came to me: 'Oh, oh, oh, it's magic."'
That snippet of a chorus not only seared the "O" in Ozempic into consumers' temporal lobes, but its cheerfulness sold the promise of the drug: to "help people get back to a level of health when their life was bright and their future was optimistic," said Jeff Rothstein, chief executive of CultHealth, the ad agency for Ozempic. Also, baby boomers exposed to the jingle would subconsciously hear the missing word "magic," which, said Shepler, helped reinforce the drug's transformative quality.
Novo licensed the song from Sony Music Publishing, and Rothstein hired a music production house to record the brand-specific version of "Magic." When they tested a rough version of the commercial, "It was the highest scoring ad we'd ever seen," Shepler said.
As the spot first began airing in 2018 (direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising is allowed only in the United States and New Zealand), Paton wasn't even aware that "Magic" had been licensed for the advert. "I learned about it through Facebook," he said. "Fans would write me, 'I'm hearing "Magic" every 20 minutes on my TV'."
Paton and Billy Lyall, his Pilot bandmate who died in 1989 at age 36, share a co-writing credit on "Magic," and split the revenue generated by the composition with Sony Publishing. (Songs generate multiple income streams, some based on the performance or master recording, some based on the songwriting. In this case, since the original recording of "Magic" was not used by Novo Nordisk, Pilot's record label, Warner Music Group, was not involved.)
As is common practice in the music industry, Sony was not obligated to receive permission from the songwriters to license the song. Not that Paton minded: Three music-industry executives, asked separately to assess the value of the Ozempic deal, said it was most likely worth seven figures to Paton. (Paton, Sony Music Publishing and Novo Nordisk all declined to discuss financial terms of the deal.)
The Ozempic commercial "is another example of why classic, iconic music catalogs are great investments," said Jon Singer, chairman of Spirit Music Group, a music publishing company with a repertoire that includes songs by the Who, Chicago, Toto and T. Rex.
"Music as an asset can have multiple lives," added Billy Mann, a Grammy-nominated songwriter and longtime publishing executive. "There's a 'comfort food' feeling of nostalgia that hit songs can trigger. They're time machines."
In the Spotify era, older songs have spiked in value, as consumers repeatedly press play on the songs of their youth. For artists, those fractions of a penny eventually add up, and that has helped create a gold rush for veteran acts looking to sell their music catalogs. "There's a finite number of songs that have proven to be iconic for 40 or 50 years," said Bill Werde, the director of the Bandier music business program at Syracuse University and the author of the industry newsletter "Full Rate No Cap." "Those songs have special value on the marketplace."
Licensing a song for a commercial may be seen by some as antithetical to the countercultural spirit of rock 'n' roll. "There have always been protectors of the flame who, when certain songs get used in certain moments, aggressively clutch their pearls," Werde said. "But there's very little evidence that this has ever harmed any artist." He pointed to the Beatles licensing their utopian "All You Need Is Love" to Luvs diapers in 2007 as perhaps the most egregious example of an advertiser co-opting a song's original meaning. "But no one really cared. It was Ob-la-di. Life goes on."
Simon Allaway, 52, an Ozempic user and Chicago-based computer programmer and musician, loves the "Magic" spot. "I can't help but sing along to it," he said. "It's a perfect fit with the product." Another user wrote in a message-board post that whenever she injects herself, her father sings "Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic."
"Magic" has been leased plenty of times before, for a Coca-Cola commercial -- "I actually sang 'Coke, Coke, Coke, it's Magic' back in the '70s," Paton recalled -- for the 2005 Disney film "Herbie: Fully Loaded" and as the musical bed for Flo Rida's 2009 single, also called "Magic," to name a few. "People always want to use the song in some way or the other," Paton said.
Asked if he was bothered by his song's association with what turned out to be a lightning-rod product, he smiled and shook his head. "I was delighted! I'm a songwriter. I want to sell my music. A lot of people don't know the name Pilot, but they know the Ozempic song."
For musicians, the success of the Ozempic commercial could be a harbinger of big checks to come. Pharmaceutical companies have seemingly unlimited budgets to promote their wares: according to the media analytics firm Guideline, pharma surpassed tech and auto in 2023 to become the second largest industry for ad spending, behind only consumer packaged goods.
Already, Lady Gaga is a spokesperson for Pfizer's migraine medication Nurtec ODT; Cyndi Lauper lends her distinct Brooklyn accent to a commercial for Cosentyx, which treats plaque psoriasis; John Legend and Charlie Puth pitch Pfizer's Covid vaccine and boosters. The Jackson 5's "ABC" propels ads for Trelegy (used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), while commercials for the heart drug Entresto are soundtracked by Sonny & Cher's "The Beat Goes On."
But those spots haven't embedded themselves into pop culture the way "Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic" has.
"In contemporary advertising, campaigns tend to have pretty short shelf lives," CultHealth's Rothstein said. "Two, three years, tops. Yet 'Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic' continues to endure. You can do all the market research in the world, and never end up with something like this."

From Japanese Farm to Chip 'Fab': [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Taiwan's semiconductor giant, TSMC, is quickly remaking a farm town in Japan into Asia's next hub of chip manufacturing with enormous government support.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is transforming the small Japanese farm town of Kikuyo into a key node in Asia's chip supply chain.
TSMC, as the company is known, dominates the global semiconductor business. At its home base in Taiwan, TSMC sits at the center of a web of factories, suppliers and engineering firms. Now that same infrastructure, backed by billions of dollars from the Japanese government, is being built about 750 miles away in the cow pastures and cabbage fields of Kikuyo in southwestern Japan.
In February, TSMC opened a factory, known as a chip "fab," for fabricator, on a ridge overlooking Kikuyo. It was its first outside Taiwan since 2018.
The area around the fab is already busy with TSMC employees and suppliers. Chemical companies and equipment makers are vying for a piece of the semiconductor economy. The Japanese electronics giants Sony, Denso and Toyota, major buyers of TSMC semiconductors, are investing huge sums in TSMC's Japan subsidiary.
On roadsides and in shopping malls and hotels, signs in traditional Chinese characters offer services for recent arrivals: real estate agents, lawyers and restaurants. The town's foreign population has doubled in the last year.
The high-tech factory town in the making in Kikuyo is evidence of the upheaval in the semiconductor business. For years, the supply chain for the tiny chips inside smartphones, cars and fighter jets depended largely on just a few factories in Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory. Then, the Covid-19 pandemic, Beijing's increasingly hostile posture toward Taiwan and a global chip shortage exposed the risks of such concentrated production.
In response, governments have pledged to spend billions to bring chip making to their shores. TSMC over the past four years has committed to build new fabs in the United States, Japan and Germany.
On Monday, the U.S. Commerce Department announced up to $ 6.6 billion in grants to TSMC that the company will use to build a third factory in Phoenix, in addition to the two facilities it has already committed to build there, federal officials said.
TSMC's American factories have been repeatedly delayed. And even though construction on the first factory began a full year later, the fab in Japan is already up and running and will be fully operational by the end of the year.
Japan, once a chip-making powerhouse, has committed $ 26 billion to revive the industry, with an emphasis on the chips used in cars. About a third of that money has gone to TSMC's operations. Japan's plans to build up the chip industry and supply chain will require tens of billions of dollars in additional public and private investment. Companies will need a surge of workers with the right skills, and they will need housing.
"Everyone could see the government's support for the entire ecosystem, especially the supply chain, including factories, construction, transportation and airports," said Ray Yang, a director at the Industrial Technology Research Institute, a Taiwan government-sponsored group that supports tech companies. including TSMC, in their early stages. This top-down push to efficiently set up the entire supply chain was indispensable, Mr. Yang said.
At rush hour in Kikuyo one day last month, the train platform at once-sleepy Haramizu station was crowded with workers from TSMC suppliers like Applied Materials and Tokyo Electron. Some carried hard hats in clear plastic backpacks while they waited for the train into Kumamoto, the nearest big city.
Ryuji Yamamoto was sent to Taiwan for six months of training last year and now works 12-hour shifts at the TSMC fab in Kikuyo. "I found it tough to get used to the long hours at first," he said. "But speed is the key in the semiconductor industry."
In recent months, thousands of workers labored around the clock in Kikuyo to build the TSMC fab and prepare the machines and materials for making chips.
On the February day when the fab opened its doors, ahead of schedule, the government said it would invest another $ 4.85 billion in a second factory.
Sony, which has been manufacturing in Kikuyo for more than 20 years, helped local officials draw TSMC there, according to Takatoshi Yoshimoto, the town's mayor.
TSMC brought over as many as 400 workers from Taiwan and is paying salaries that are roughly 30 percent higher than those at other manufacturing jobs in the area, prompting other businesses to raise wages. At the Kikuyo town office, fliers with dozens of classified ads call out for people to work in semiconductor factories or with their suppliers.
In Taiwan, where TSMC has built 15 fabs over 37 years, the company relies on an established network of suppliers, construction companies and skilled workers. It builds a new fab every few years to churn out ever smaller and faster chips.
Analysts said TSMC's experience in Japan showed that the company could recreate that pace outside Taiwan, even though it has struggled to do so in Arizona.
TSMC's factory in Phoenix has been under construction since April 2021. The next year, the company said it would also build another, bringing its commitment there to $ 40 billion. The first is slated to begin mass production next year and the second in 2027 or 2028.
"Even though we encountered some challenges in Arizona for our first fab construction, we are still the fastest player, from groundbreaking to equipment move-in," Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said in a statement. "We believe the construction of our second fab will be much smoother."
The company has said one challenge has been a shortage of skilled workers. Labor unions objected to TSMC's bringing in foreign workers for jobs that they said locals could do, setting off months of negotiations.
Many of the companies that have supplied chemicals and materials to TSMC for years are in Taiwan. For several, plans to set up shop in Arizona were on hold.
"Because it has announced delays, the suppliers are not sure how long TSMC will take to come up to speed," said Lita Shon-Roy, chief executive at Techcet, a chip material consultant.
No matter the outcome of TSMC's foreign ventures, the company will keep its most advanced output at home, Mr. Liu said in an interview last year.
Ensuring a pipeline of skilled workers is also a concern for TSMC in Japan. To get the factory up and running, some Japanese engineers from Sony were temporarily transferred to TSMC and sent to Taiwan for training. The local technical college in Kumamoto has ramped up electrical engineering courses, and TSMC has hired 17 of its graduates.
On a recent night in a tatami-paneled banquet hall in Kumamoto, the city 10 miles from the new TSMC factory, visiting investors from Taiwan exchanged gifts with their hosts, a local chamber of commerce. Bottles of Kirin beer, tiny glasses of sake, T-shirts and key chains were passed around and plates of sushi placed in front of each person. "To all the money we're going to make," went the final toast.
All the spending has set off a real estate boom. Prices are already going up, causing anxiety among some local residents. Investors have agreed to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on plots of farmland via video calls.
"There aren't any other places in Japan growing like this," said Shogo Okuda, an agent at housing developer Shichiro Kensetsu, who grew up in the area.
The TSMC workers come to Kikuyo from cities near the company's core production centers in Taiwan like Hsinchu and Tainan, which have some of the highest property values in Taiwan.
Many new arrivals have called Cake Liao, a Taiwanese property agent, looking for a home that is move-in ready and furnished, which is typical in urban Taiwan but not in rural Japan.
"They say, 'Just go to the Kumamoto area and find me something,"' Ms. Liao said at the dining room table in a model home. "This is the new Hsinchu."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Julian Phethean's first canvas in London was a shed in his backyard where he covered the walls with bold lettering in spray paint. When he moved his art to the city's streets in the 1980s, it was largely unwelcome -- and he was even arrested a few times.
"We had nowhere to practice," he said. "It was just seen as vandalism."
These days, the canvases come to Mr. Phethean, better known as the muralist Mr Cenz. Recent facades, which he shares with his sizable following, have included an abstract mural on a Tesla showroom and a portrait of Biggie Smalls, sponsored by Pepsi Max.
"I never would have envisioned that I'd be able to do it for a living," he said.
Landlords wanting to attract young professionals once scrubbed off the rebellious scrawls. That was before graffiti moved from countercultural to mainstream. Now building owners are willing to pay for it.
From Berlin to London to Miami, the wider acceptance of graffiti has attracted developers looking to expand into trendy areas, companies wanting to relocate to hipper neighborhoods and brands seeking creative ways to advertise their products.
But that attention to once overlooked neighborhoods has pushed up rents, leaving artists, fans and local officials with a quandary: What happens after the street art that brought character becomes commodified?
Contemporary graffiti traces back to the anti-establishment expression of the 1960s and 1970s, when anyone with a can of spray paint could tag the sidewalks of Philadelphia and the subway cars of New York. In Soviet-era Berlin, protesters splattered the west side of the wall while the east side remained blank -- until it fell in 1989, opening vast new canvases overnight.
The gallery world took note, but it was social media and the fame of artists like Banksy, Vhils and Lady Pink that propelled it to a wider audience. What followed was a movement that experts say has been reproduced from Australia to Argentina, as street art added to a neighborhood's cultural cachet.
Take Shoreditch in east London as an example: Decades ago, developers deemed it a run-down industrial area. Still, it was a sanctuary for artists who made use of cheap rents to build a creative enclave.
"What artists bring is a sense of buzz: newness, creativity, trends," said Rosie Haslem, managing director of Streetsense UK, a consulting agency. "Hipsters attract more hipsters who have more money and are able to start paying higher prices."
That buzz also drew developers and companies that sought to leverage the popularity of Shoreditch. A former tea-packing plant now hosts a branch of the private members' club Soho House. Down the road is Amazon's largest corporate office in the region.
Spray painters still add political messages to the mosaic of artwork in east London. But they are nestled between more commercial interests: hand-painted campaigns sponsored by L'Oréal, Sky and Adidas, and street tours that treat the art as a tourist attraction.
Many campaigns are from agencies that act as middlemen between artists and the businesses interested in their work.
"We were splashing around in the water and a wave came," said Lee Bofkin, a co-founder of Global Street Art, a London advertising agency. In the decade since its inception, it has grown to more than 30 employees, and Adidas, Moncler and Valentino have leased its walls.
Developers are responsible for a chunk of the 300 or so murals splattering Miami's Wynwood neighborhood. The windowless walls of the former garment district had long appealed to graffiti artists, but one developer helped drive the 2009 opening of the Wynwood Walls, an open-air gallery visited by three million people each year.
"We had to find a carrot to try to bring investment into the area," said Manny Gonzalez, the executive director of the Wynwood Business Improvement District. Street art, he said, was the lure. "We knew that we needed to keep the art."
Five years ago, there were no office buildings in Wynwood. Now, tenants include Spotify, the accounting firm PwC and the venture capitalist Founders Fund. Sony Music has leased office space there. And tech companies from San Francisco and New York are coming, Mr. Gonzalez said.
Those employees will need somewhere to live, and developers are betting they stay local. At the forefront is the Related Group, a developer that has built a "market rate" co-living apartment building with a rooftop pool and a distinctive mural by the artist El Mac. Last year, Related broke ground on luxury condominiums, and it commissions artists to add visual flair to its buildings.
"Every lobby, every hallway, common space, public area of the building has art in it," said Patricia Hanna, art director at Related. "The philosophy is to continue what Wynwood is."
For investors, backing buildings in these districts is paying off. In Shoreditch, leasing a prime work space cost about $ 90 per square foot in the last quarter of 2023, according to CBRE, 112 percent higher than the same quarter in 2008. Rents in the City of London, the financial district, increased 40 percent in the same period.
The asking price for office leases in Wynwood was about $ 80 per square foot in the fourth quarter of 2023, 83 percent higher than the average in Miami-Dade County, according to Colliers.
The east side of the Berlin Wall in Friedrichshain is now an open-air gallery, and the average rent in the area has doubled in the past 10 years, higher growth than in neighboring districts, according to Savills. Developers have tried to bring that artistic buzz to other neighborhoods: One popular exhibit, The Haus, was hosted in a former bank by a developer, Pandion, which later replaced the old building with sleek condominiums. All of them have sold.
A large outdoor facade could cost six figures, said Charlotte Specht, a co-founder of Basa Studio, an agency in Berlin that has helped street artists collaborate with brands like Maybelline and Netflix. Brands eager for campaigns have a demographic in mind for their target customers: "They use Uber, they have an Apple Mac, they get their latte to go, they travel," Ms. Specht said.
Street art had acted as "a powerful engine" to turn some neighborhoods into economic and cultural centers, said Thomas Zabel, managing director of Savills Germany. "Everybody wants to live there."
But officials are wondering how to regulate street art, and whether the commercialization changes a neighborhood's identity.
In Lisbon, a municipal body called the Urban Art Gallery presides over new creations, resulting in a visual feast: Street art is splashed on walkways and train stations, and officials have pushed street art festivals and tours to beautify the city's rougher neighborhoods. International students, digital nomads and foreign investors have rushed in.
Researchers say Lisbon has successfully used that art to brand itself as a hip destination. But its revival is divisive for the city's less privileged, who argue that they have been pushed out of their homes.
In Wynwood, property owners promise that they intend to preserve the neighborhood's artistic heritage. New buildings must include some art on their facades, and hand-painted advertisements are illegal.
But those regulations, some say, have led to diminishing organic spaces for artists, who cannot make the most of sponsored opportunities. "The developers become gatekeepers to some extent as to what the public gets to see," said Allison Freidin, a co-founder of Miami's Museum of Graffiti. "And you hope that the developers make a great decision."
A harder-to-quantify cost is the displacement of residents who can no longer afford to live there.
"It's really seen as a success story: Oh, look how art transformed this desolate area of a wasteland into this beautiful successful hipster area with restaurants and tourists," said Rafael Schacter, an anthropologist at University College London. The art, he believes, has been complicit in erasing communities for not being "the right kind of people."
Residents have pushed back. In Kreuzberg, a cultural haven near Berlin's old wall, residents criticized the opening of a Google tech incubator, which eventually moved elsewhere. Artists there have painted over their own murals to protest gentrification and voiced concerns over sponsored content's replacing public art. In Los Angeles, graffiti artists risked trespassing charges to slather an abandoned luxury tower, which in turn has boosted curiosity toward it.
Aware of the tensions, businesses have started charitable arms that their commercial projects help fund. Some, like Global Street Art, paint murals in local neighborhoods. Others, like Basa Studio, say they want to help artists get paid fairly for their contributions.
But places like Shoreditch have already lost their edge as they have turned mainstream, Ms. Haslem of Streetsense, the consulting agency, said. "The risk in commodifying or commercializing some of this graffiti is you end up sanitizing it," she said.
"It's a double-edged sword," said Dean Stockton, who has painted for years under the name D*Face. He was disconcerted by the number of tourists on buses who stared as he worked on a recent Wynwood mural with the words "I WANT TO LEAVE."
"If you are going to dance with the devil," he said, "make sure you are getting paid handsomely."

5 Classical Music Albums You Can Listen to Right Now: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Julia Perry's Violin Concerto, a collection of Copland works conducted by Copland and a program of songs by Black composers are among the highlights.
'American Counterpoints'
Experiential Orchestra; James Blachly, conductor; Curtis Stewart, violin (Bright Shiny Things)
Julia Perry, who would have turned 100 this month, achieved some real recognition during her lifetime, but -- in a tale all too common for composers who aren't white men -- fell into obscurity after her death in 1979. There have been recent efforts to revive her works, including her Violin Concerto, written in the 1960s and now recorded by the Experiential Orchestra under James Blachly, with Curtis Stewart as the soloist.
This brooding, 25-minute piece begins with a passionate violin cadenza, played like the rest of the concerto with heated commitment from Stewart, and then evolves frequently, without defined section breaks. It is a fine example of the sober yet seething angularity of its era, leavened with warm strings and hints of Coplandesque expansiveness.
It's a vigorous work of mid-20th-century Neo-Classicism, and has fine company on the album in another: Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson's Sinfonietta No. 1, with a wrenching slow movement and a driving finale. The recording also includes Perkinson's violin solo "Louisiana Blues Strut," lively in the performance by Stewart, whose raucous, hip-hop-influenced "We Who Seek" appears as well. And there is more Perry: the lushly contemplative Prelude for Strings, the alternately assertive and hovering Symphony in One Movement for Violas and Basses and the hymn "Ye, Who Seek the Truth," in an instrumental arrangement by Jannina Norpoth. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Copland Conducts Copland: The Complete Columbia Album Collection'
(Sony)
When Aaron Copland died in 1990, Allan Kozinn wrote in The New York Times, "Composers' performances are not always definitive, but Copland was a fine, communicative conductor and pianist." That assessment is amply borne out by this 20-CD box set of the composer's recordings of his own oeuvre for Columbia Records.
Somewhat surprisingly, Copland shows himself less convincing in populist works like "Appalachian Spring" and "Rodeo," pieces in which others have brought out the music's rhythmic snap more adroitly. Where he excels on the podium is in brawnier fare, such as "Music for a Great City," "Statements" and "Symphonic Ode," reminding a listener how sharp-elbowed his orchestral writing could be. He was also a superb pianist and accompanist, as heard in recordings of the Sonata for Violin and Piano (with Isaac Stern); the Piano Quartet (with members of the Juilliard String Quartet); and various song cycles. Benny Goodman's two accounts of the Clarinet Concerto will remain classics as long as this music is cherished.
Perhaps most revealing in this set are clips from Copland's rehearsals for the chamber version of "Appalachian Spring." More than once, he warns the musicians that their playing is verging too close to straight sentiment. "The sound's on the Tchaikovsky side," he says at one point. "Make it more American spirit [...] more cool. The music by itself is warm -- you don't have to help it." Conductors should heed his advice. DAVID WEININGER
'Wide As Heaven: A Century of Song by Black American Composers'
James Martin, baritone; Lynn Raley, piano (New World)
The New World label is committed to Black American classical repertoire, with releases including a period-orchestra version of Scott Joplin's opera "Treemonisha," the "Black Manhattan" series and Anthony Davis's more contemporary "Amistad."
This varied, moving and entertaining album extends that tradition, with pieces by Davis, William Grant Still and many others -- and with powerful performances by the baritone James Martin and the pianist Lynn Raley. Take Harry T. Burleigh's magnificent setting of the Whitman poem "Ethiopia Saluting the Colors": Here, Martin is robust and convincing when voicing both a Union Army soldier and an older, enslaved woman who is saluting the American flag.
But where the baritone Thomas Hampson has, in the past, smoothly navigated the repetition of "sunder'd" during the woman's story, Martin allows a slight, vulnerable tremor to enter into his second pass at the word. At the piano, Raley's crisp attack maximizes the piece's occasionally chromatic approach to military gait. And that's just one of the fine items here. Hall Johnson's "On the Dusty Road" has marvelous blues feeling; Davis's "Bells" rings with echoes of bebop and gamelan during its take on art song. And the boogie-woogie piano elements of Margaret Bonds's "The Way We Dance in Harlem" inspires rousing vocalizations from Martin. SETH COLTER WALLS
Duruflé: Requiem; Poulenc: Lenten Motets
Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge; Harrison Cole, organ; Stephen Layton, conductor (Hyperion)
Note for note, Maurice Duruflé's Requiem is an astoundingly pretty work that critics have described as "a luxuriant harmonic bath" and "an impressionist's large-scale plainsong fantasy." Trained as an organist and steeped in the melodic mysticism of Gregorian chant, Duruflé deployed plainsong with a naturalness and harmonic sophistication that sound anachronistic for the mid-20th century, but also sound eternal.
The Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge, dials up the plushness with the 1948 version for organ, and the instrument at Saint-Eustache in Paris is so sonorous and pillowy as to render an orchestra wholly unnecessary. The organist Harrison Cole swathes the sumptuous choruses in downy comfort. Chords and busy 16th-note runs drift by like clouds. Even harmonic abrasions have a smooth-edged refinement.
Stephen Layton's baton keeps the music flowing, all lush and heady, and the Trinity singers, treating consonants as mere suggestions, string together syllables into a liquid legato. Vaporous strands float from the soprano section, and the altos and basses are warmly anchoring yet improbably diaphanous. The tenors' bright cast occasionally pierces the mood, and the vocal soloists inject welcome verve and personality amid the ensemble's anonymous gorgeousness.
An incisive rendition of Poulenc's Four Lenten Motets for a cappella chorus closes the album in a display of versatility, but the Requiem's final movement, "In Paradisum," provides the true resolution. The richly arrayed divisi singing, solid yet transparent, dissolves into the organ's final chord, an elegant metaphor for apotheosis. OUSSAMA ZAHR
Bruckner: Symphony No. 7
Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra; Bernard Haitink, conductor (BR Klassik)
Does the world really need another recording of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony by Bernard Haitink? That's a reasonable question: Bruckner's symphonies were central to the eminent conductor's repertoire, especially the Seventh, the work with which he bid farewell to his musical career, in 2019. At least five other commercial recordings were available before the release of this 1981 live performance. It takes little searching to find more.
Still, I found this new entry impossible to resist. Haitink was a master at pacing large symphonic structures with impeccable, understated eloquence. Few pieces reward this skill like Bruckner's Seventh, and here he shapes with just enough momentum to propel the vast opening movements onward without sacrificing the music's sonic splendor. The Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra plays with a refinement that's expected, and a transparency that surprises. The ensemble's brasses are appropriately potent at the work's many apexes, but they impress even more when the score calls for delicacy and restraint.
Bruckner front-loads so much in the first two movements that the other half of the symphony can feel like an afterthought. One additional virtue of this account is that Haitink makes the mazelike finale spring with energy, charm and a constant sense of wonder. DAVID WEININGER

Full text: Raised by a McCarthy-era rebel, the producer and journalist Hannah Weinstein, she followed her mother's path into movies and television, advocacy and action.
Paula Weinstein, a movie producer, studio executive and political activist who became a fierce advocate for women in her industry, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.
Her sister Lisa Weinstein confirmed the death. She said the cause was not yet known.
In the boy's club of Hollywood, Ms. Weinstein was the rare female top executive: Over her long career, she was president of United Artists, a vice president of Warner Bros. and an executive vice president at 20th Century Fox. She was just 33 when she was hired at Fox in 1978, and when she was promoted to vice president a year later, The Los Angeles Times called her "the highest-ranking woman in the motion picture industry."
"A man can be mediocre in almost everything, but a women's got to be perfect," she told Life magazine that year, when she was included in an article about Hollywood's "Young Tycoons."
But Ms. Weinstein, who colleagues said possessed a wicked sense of humor -- her sister described her laugh as an infectious cackle -- and a steely commitment to social justice, was unusual in Hollywood beyond her gender. As Ken Sunshine, the veteran public relations consultant and longtime Democratic activist, put it in a phone interview: "Unlike so many, she didn't play at politics. To her, social and political change was paramount. She was the antithesis of a phony Hollywood activist looking for good P.R. or a career boost. She was unique in a sea of pretenders."
Activism was the family business: Her mother, Hannah Weinstein, was a journalist and speechwriter who in 1950 took her three young daughters to live in Paris and then London, fleeing the grim and punitive politics of the country's McCarthy era. In Britain, where the family lived for more than a decade, Hannah Weinstein produced movies and television series using blacklisted actors and writers like Ring Lardner Jr. and Ian McLellan Hunter. She repeatedly told her daughters, as Lisa recalled, "If you believe in something, you have to be willing to get up off your ass and do something, and if you don't get up off your ass, you really didn't believe in it."
"She was a daunting role model," Lisa Weinstein added.
It was Hannah who steered Paula into the movie business, by way of Jane Fonda.
"Hannah was the first person I ever asked for money as an activist," Ms. Fonda said in an email. "It was to open the G.I. office in D.C. in 1970, where concerns facing soldiers could be brought to Congress. She gave me $ 2,000 -- astonishing in 1970. Some years later, Hannah called me to ask if I could help her daughter, Paula, who had just graduated from Columbia University, get a job in Hollywood. She said I 'owed her one."'
The two women then met for lunch at a Hamburger Hamlet in Los Angeles and were instantly smitten with each other. They were of like mind, both having been involved in the antiwar protests of the 1960s, and both with arrests under their belts -- Ms. Weinstein's for taking part in a protest at Columbia. Soon after, Ms. Weinstein became Ms. Fonda's agent, helping her get the role of Lillian Hellman in "Julia" (1977), based on Ms. Hellman's book "Pentimento."
"It helped that Lillian was Paula's godmother," Ms. Fonda said.
Her next job was at Fox, where she oversaw the production of "9 to 5" (1980), the hit comedy starring Ms. Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton as office workers who revolt against their sexist employer. More recently, she reunited with Ms. Fonda and Ms. Tomlin as an executive producer of the long-running Netflix series "Grace and Frankie."
Ms. Weinstein produced more than 30 films, including "The Perfect Storm" (2000), starring George Clooney as a Massachusetts fishing boat captain -- and co-starring an epic nor'easter -- as well as the comedy "Analyze This" (1999) and its sequel, "Analyze That" (2002), with Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. She was also a founder, with Ms. Fonda, Barbra Streisand and others, of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, a fund-raising powerhouse for liberal candidates and causes from 1984 to the late 1990s.
With her husband, Mark Rosenberg, whom she met when they were both members of the national activist organization Students for a Democratic Society, Ms. Weinstein made a number of films, including "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (1989), with Jeff and Beau Bridges and Michelle Pfeiffer, and "Fearless" (1993), also starring Jeff Bridges. They also made "Citizen Cohn" (1992), an HBO movie about Roy Cohn, the lawyer and fixer for Senator Joseph McCarthy -- a topic close to Ms. Weinstein's heart, given her upbringing. Their final production together was "Flesh and Bone" (1993); Mr. Rosenberg died of heart failure at age 44 while working on the set of that film.
Ms. Weinstein continued to make films for Spring Creek Productions, the company she and her husband had formed -- notably another HBO film, "Recount" (2008), a political thriller based on the hairline finish of the 2000 presidential election and Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court case that decided the election in George W. Bush's favor.
"Paula knew how to marry the commercial with the political," said Lucy Fisher, the veteran producer and former vice chair of Sony Pictures, who considered Ms. Weinstein a mentor, "but not in a medicinal way. She invented the format that became HBO's imprimatur, the high-quality but gossipy-behind-the-scenes drama."
Paula Weinstein was born on Nov. 19, 1945, in Manhattan, the youngest of three daughters. Her mother, Hannah (Dorner) Weinstein, met her father, Isidore Weinstein, known as Pete, when they were hired as speechwriters for Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. At the time, Hannah was a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and Pete was a reporter for The Brooklyn Eagle.
The couple had separated by 1950, and Hannah subsequently left the country with her daughters. They returned to the U.S. in 1962, and Paula enrolled in Columbia soon after.
In addition to her sister Lisa, Ms. Weinstein is survived by another sister, Dina, and her daughter, Hannah Rosenberg.
Since 2013, Ms. Weinstein had been chief content officer for Tribeca Enterprises, which includes the Tribeca Film Festival and Tribeca Studios, where she developed branded content and ran mentorship programs for emerging writers and directors. She left Tribeca last fall to focus on political work.
"I don't want to sit on the sidelines and rail about everything. I really want to jump in, fully, into the campaigns. Both statewide and national campaigns," she told Deadline magazine after her departure. "It just feels very much like a moment ... between the climate, and book banning and everything else that I don't need to go into."
At Ms. Weinstein's death, tributes poured in from her colleagues and friends, including from Debora Cahn, a writer and producer.
"Paula was a force of nature," Ms. Cahn wrote. "She taught me so much about so many things. How to stand up and be the thing. Stand in front. Talk loud. Be outraged and happy."

Full text: Team Ninja showed its talent for finely tuned combat in games like Ninja Gaiden and Nioh. Its first open-world game presents new design challenges that are not always met.
After decades of designing linear video game adventures such as the Ninja Gaiden and Nioh series, Team Ninja has dropped the guardrails and loosed players into an open world.
Its latest offering, Rise of the Ronin, is set during the mid-19th century when Japan opened its doors to Western influence and the last of the shogunates was nearing its end. Players step into the armor of one of a pair of warriors, referred to as "Blade Twins," and take on missions from either those aligned with tradition, or those pushing for a more modern Japan.
After stealing a letter containing secret information early in the game, the player's ronin, or masterless samurai, must decide which faction most deserves it. By making these types of decisions throughout Rise of the Ronin, some of the narrative can be altered.
"It was a time of chaos," Yosuke Hayashi, the game's producer, said in an email. "Japan's long period of isolationism was at an end and such significant upheaval resulted in various sets of values coming into conflict."
Fans of the combat in Team Ninja's previous work will not be disappointed. Battles in Rise of the Ronin are lightning fast, full of parries, counterstrikes and flying sparks as steel meets steel. As the camera revolves around the action, it can feel like players are in a Formula 1 racecar driven by Akira Kurosawa.
But the studio's first experience building an open world, where players are given a large area that they can explore as they see fit, shows how challenging it is to construct one.
Most of the buildings in Rise of the Ronin, which was released last week for the PlayStation 5, feel flat, with doors that do not open except in very specific cases. Repeated character models wander the street in rote patterns. The optional quests largely feel the same: Go somewhere and kill a bunch of enemies. In many ways, the game's open world feels like one created for the twilight of an older generation of consoles like the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.
Player expectations for contemporary open-world games are high. They seek compelling activities that drive forward the game's overarching narrative, as well as completely unrelated side quests that can tell smaller but evocative stories. They want a sense of exploration and discovery, a feeling that there is always something on the other side of that mountain in the distance.
Those are different sensations than Team Ninja capably delivered with its previous titles, such as the Nioh series and last year's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, which generally marched players along a linear path.
In all of those games -- Nioh and its sequel take their inspiration from Japanese myths and monsters, while Wo Long looks at a demon-infested version of China's Han dynasty -- action takes center stage. To succeed, a stamina meter and an intricate system of strikes, parries and stances must be managed. Players face many smaller foes before encountering a more powerful warrior or monster. Exploration is not the point.
Serkan Toto, a video game industry consultant in Tokyo, said Team Ninja had a well-earned reputation as one of Japan's best action-game developers, but theorized that the studio might have worked too quickly to put its own spin on Japanese history after the success of Ghost of Tsushima, a 2020 game for the PlayStation based on the Mongols' first invasion of Japan.
Ghost of Tsushima, which was created by Sucker Punch Productions, was praised critically, won several awards and sold about 10 million copies. In comparison, Toto said, Rise of the Ronin "looks uninspired, underproduced and a bit unambitious."
Team Ninja did work to mitigate some of the downsides of open-world games, which can devolve into oceans of random tasks that drown players and their attention spans.
In Ubisoft series like Assassin's Creed and Far Cry, the world map is covered in icons telling players exactly what to expect when they arrive at a location. In FromSoftware's Elden Ring, however, the map is blank and players must wander out blindly to learn.
"We have worked to ensure the player does not feel overwhelmed by the need to digest a large volume of information," Hayashi said. "We were always conscious of giving the game a density that would offer players a feeling of immersion."
In that, the game does succeed. Players are unlikely to be overwhelmed by their options as they roam freely. But how immersed they feel will probably have more to do with how much they crave epic duels to the death, rather than a living, breathing world to explore.

Beyoncé's Country Is America: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On the bold, sprawling "Cowboy Carter," the superstar plays fast and loose -- and twangy -- with genre.
The first song on "Cowboy Carter," Beyoncé's not-exactly-country album, makes a pre-emptive strike. "It's a lot of talking going on while I sing my song," she observes in "Ameriican Requiem" over guitar strums and electric sitar, adding, "It's a lot of chatter in here."
That's an acknowledgment that a pop superstar's job now extends well beyond creating and performing songs. In the era of streaming and social media, Beyoncé knows that her every public appearance and utterance will be scrutinized, commented on, cross-referenced, circulated as clickbait and hot-taked in both good faith and bad. Every phrase and image are potential memes and hyperlinks.
It's a challenge she has engaged head-on since she released her visual album "Beyoncé" in 2013. For the last decade, even as her tours have filled stadiums, she has set herself goals outside of generating hits. Beyoncé has deliberately made each of her recent albums not only a musical performance but also an argument: about power, style, history, family, ambition, sexuality, bending rules. They're albums meant to be discussed and footnoted, not just listened to.
"Cowboy Carter" is an overstuffed album, 27 tracks maxing out the 79-minute capacity of a CD and stretching across two LPs. It flaunts spoken-word co-signs from Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton that interrupt its flow; it includes some fragmentary, minute-long songs. Its sprawl is its own statement of confidence: that even half-finished experiments are worth attention.
The "Cowboy Carter" album cover is an opening salvo, brandishing western and American symbols: Beyoncé holding an American flag while riding a white horse sidesaddle, with platinum-blond hair proudly streaming. In a red-white-and-blue outfit, high-heeled boots and a pageant sash that reads "Cowboy Carter," she's a beauty queen and a white-hatted heroine claiming her nation -- her country, in both senses. The politics of her new songs are vague and glancing, but the music insists that every style is her American birthright. As a pop star it is: Pop has always breached stylistic boundaries, constantly exploiting subcultures to annex whatever might make a song catchier.
Beyoncé grew up in Texas, where country music has long mingled with styles from jazz to blues to hip-hop -- and where, in fact, early cowboys were enslaved Black men. Beyoncé met a racial backlash when she performed "Daddy Lessons," a country song from her 2016 album "Lemonade" about gun-toting self-defense, with the (then-Dixie) Chicks at the 2016 Country Music Association Awards. Presumably that's what she alluded to when she wrote on Instagram that there was "an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed."
She wasn't daunted. Instead she pushed further, and the mere prospect of Beyoncé releasing a country album stirred things up. Even before its release, "Cowboy Carter" prompted reminders of country's obscured Black roots -- like the African origins of the banjo and the genre's long cross-pollination with the blues -- and pointed at, yet again, its historical exclusion of nonwhite performers, despite a handful of exceptions like Martell, Charley Pride and, more recently, Darius Rucker, Mickey Guyton and Kane Brown.
What Beyoncé drew from country is productions that feature hand-played instruments -- guitars, keyboards, drums -- rather than the programmed beats and glittering electronics that propelled her 2022 album "Renaissance," which also had Beyoncé on horseback on the cover and was subtitled "Act I." That album was Beyoncé's time-warped, multilayered homage to the electronic dance music that emerged from Black gay subcultures. "Cowboy Carter," subtitled "Act II," also scrambles eras and styles, with samples, electronics and multitracked vocal harmonies unapologetically joining the guitars.
The advance singles from "Cowboy Carter" paired "16 Carriages," a booming arena-country song about Beyoncé's industrious career and artistic drive, with the foot-stomping, banjo-picking "Texas Hold 'Em," about enjoying Texas-style good times away from home. "Texas Hold 'Em" seized No. 1 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, making Beyoncé the first Black woman to do so, and topped the all-genre Hot 100.
If Beyoncé had merely wanted to make mainstream country hits, she could have hired a seasoned Nashville producer and had her pick of expert Music Row songwriters. But "Cowboy Carter" has different aspirations, and Beyoncé brought her own brain trust, including producers known for hip-hop and R&B. "This ain't a Country album. This is a Beyoncé album," she wrote on Instagram. That's true.
"Cowboy Carter" leans into its anticipated discourse, openly interrogating categories and stereotypes and pointedly ignoring formulas. With historical savvy, Beyoncé enlisted Linda Martell -- the Black country singer whose 1970 album, "Color Me Country," included the first charting country hit by a Black woman, "Color Him Father" -- to provide spoken words. For the intro of "Spaghettii" -- which features Beyoncé rapping -- Martell says, "Genres are a funny little concept, aren't they? Yes, they are. In theory, they have a simple definition that's easy to understand. But in practice, well, some may feel confined."
Beyoncé gathers young Black women currently striving for country careers -- Brittney Spencer, Reyna Roberts, Tiera Kennedy and Tanner Adell -- on a remake of the Beatles' veiled civil-rights song, "Blackbird." It's a careful gesture, though it might have been more substantial to write a new song with them.
The album includes some understated, largely acoustic contenders for country or adult-contemporary radio play -- notably "II Most Wanted," a duet with Miley Cyrus that harks back to Fleetwood Mac's "Landslide," and "Levii's Jeans," a boast about being a "sexy little thing" that she shares with a besotted Post Malone. In the steady-thumping, Motown-tinged "Bodyguard," Beyoncé plays an amorous, jealous but selfless partner in an uncertain romance. And in "Protector," an acoustic-guitar lullaby, Beyoncé personifies a loving, supportive parent singing about "lifting you up so you will be raised."
Beyoncé also reworks Parton's "Jolene" -- a country classic about a dangerous temptress -- by turning it inside out. Where Parton's 1973 original had her "begging" Jolene to stay away, in 2024 Beyoncé isn't one to cede power. She starts out by "warning" Jolene and raises the threat level from there, reminding her target, "I know I'm a queen."
Martell returns to introduce "Ya Ya," explaining, "This particular tune stretches across a range of genres. And that's what makes it a unique listening experience." The song is a hand clapping, 1960s-flavored garage-rock stomp that samples Nancy Sinatra, quotes the Beach Boys and brandishes lines like "There's a whole lot of red in that white and blue/History can't be erased," then moves on to dancing and lust. It's not geared for any radio format. It's just a romp.
It's the odder, genre-fluid songs that give the album its depth. "Just for Fun" -- a hymnlike duet with Willie Jones, a Louisiana songwriter who draws on country and R&B -- plunges into Beyoncé's somber low register as she sings, "I need to get through this/Or just get used to it." "Riiverdance" deploys intertwined Celtic-tinged guitars and close-harmony backup vocals to sketch an enigmatic relationship that encompasses murder and resurrection and weekend seductions. And "II Hands II Heaven" is equally cryptic and celebratory; using an electronic pulse drawn from Underworld's "Born Slippy (Nuxx)," it has Beyoncé and backup voices singing about whiskey, coyotes, God, sex and "Lost virgins with broken wings that will regrow."
Beyoncé has been a stalwart of the full-length album, sequencing and juxtaposing songs in synergistic ways. But "Cowboy Carter" is a bumpier ride than "Renaissance," "Lemonade" or "Beyoncé." It suggests that Beyoncé wanted to pack all she could into one side trip before moving on elsewhere. Perhaps she's already immersed in Act III.

Elegantly Written Obscenities Roil an English Village in 1920: [Review]

Full text: Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley elevate a comedy about a weird true tale of defamation and dirty words.
"This is more true than you'd think," handwritten text informs us at the start of "Wicked Little Letters." I looked it up, and they weren't kidding. The movie involves tweaks and elisions to history, of course. But at least in its major outlines, the true story matches the film, in which a dour spinster named Edith Swan (Olivia Colman) and her raucous next-door neighbor Rose Gooding (Jessie Buckley) tangle over a series of mysteriously obscene letters that started arriving at the homes of people in the English coast village of Littlehampton in 1920. As you may intuit, this movie belongs to a very particular subgenre summed up in one declaration: boy, small English towns are full of weirdos.
Directed by Thea Sharrock (who has an impressive two movies out this week -- the other is "The Beautiful Game") from a screenplay by the comedy writer Jonny Sweet, "Wicked Little Letters" is a darkly funny take on the tale, leaning a lot more toward the farce than the darkness. Edith, the oldest daughter in a large and very pious family, still lives with her parents (Timothy Spall and Gemma Jones). They sleep in three twin beds in the same room. They rarely go anywhere and are constantly scandalized.
Edith has been under her father's thumb so long that any will she possessed has been wholly squashed out, which makes her exactly the ideal of feminine virtue for 1920s England. The men have returned from war -- those who survived, anyhow -- and retaken the jobs and roles women filled, relegating them back to the kitchen and domestic life. Edith, homely but docile, is everything a good Christian Englishwoman should be.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
And of course, anyone who deviates from Edith's type is suspicious. Rose, for instance, has committed a quadruple feat of sin: living with her Black boyfriend (Malachi Kirby), having a daughter (Alisha Weir) who dares the unladylike act of picking up a guitar, enjoying a night at the pub and, most of all, being Irish.
When she arrived in Littlehampton, she was a figure of affable curiosity to her neighbors, especially Edith. But by the time we meet them, Edith has accused Rose of sending elegantly written obscene letters to her and to the neighbors -- letters containing marvelously inventive strings of epithets so vile that I cannot reproduce them in this newspaper. Edith endures the letters with a visage so saintly that you can practically see her halo: "We worship a Messiah who suffered, so by my suffering, do I not move closer to heaven?" she intones to her parents, eyes modestly cast down.
We soon learn why Edith says Rose is motivated to write the letters. This is where the movie loses some steam, because early on, it's obvious that all is not as it seems, something the put-upon local cop Gladys Moss (Anjana Vasan) is sure of from the jump. Gladys's father was a police officer, which is why she became one, though the men she works with lord their maleness over her, putting her down at every opportunity. (She introduces herself to everyone as "Woman Police Officer Moss," because they're going to comment on it, anyhow.) Gladys is determined to hunt down the facts, with the help of a few local women who've managed to maintain minds of their own.
"Wicked Little Letters" plays like a caper, its mystery worn lightly in what is less of a mystery and more of a lavish consideration of how annoying and stupid the men of Littlehampton (and perhaps, by extension, men in general) were around 1920. Each one is an idiot (save for Rose's partner, who has dealt with plenty of slights of his own), made foolish and useless by the kind of misogyny that insists they must be better than women because, well, I mean, women, you know.
The magistrates and clergy and officers of the law all refuse to see what's right in front of them precisely because they're blinded by prejudice. They are boorish and boring and bad, and the more weak minded or browbeaten of the women follow right along.
This makes for gently witty comedy, everyone falling into their types easily and pleasantly. (At one point, "DIE SLUT" is splashed in paint across Rose's door. "It's German," she remarks to her daughter, pulling her inside.) The movie is full of goofy side characters and one-liners, yet elevated occasionally to genuine complexity by Colman and Buckley, who are consistently the best thing about any movie they're in. And, it's fun to see them together, given Buckley recently played a younger version of Colman in "The Lost Daughter."
"Wicked Little Letters" would almost be a pretty family-friendly comedy (or at least well suited for more delicate palates) save for one thing: A great deal of its humor comes from the spectacle of watching various upright, uptight, prudish figures spew uninterrupted streams of profanity in inappropriate places: courtrooms, living rooms, the middle of the street. It is pretty funny the first and second and third time. It starts to feel like a crutch after a while.
If that doesn't bug you, then "Wicked Little Letters" is enjoyable enough, buoyed by its cast, the kind of movie that provokes a few chuckles but won't stick to your ribs. But I was left pondering a particular characteristic of this kind of period movie. It has a point to make about the plight of women in a patriarchal world, whether they're seen as angels or trollops; that's not merely set dressing for the movie, but the text itself. Yet I can't escape the feeling that we're meant to laugh at the dull-witted prejudiced people of a hundred years ago, the way they suppress themselves and oppress one another. Aren't we lucky we're not like them anymore?
That's one way to look at it. The truth is more complicated. But perhaps the movie knows it: This is, as we were warned, more true than you'd think.

Full text: Roku recently changed its policy to make it even harder for customers to take legal action. It's a reminder of how we need to protect ourselves.
This month, many of the 80 million owners of Roku devices, including streaming sticks, set-top boxes and internet-connected TVs running the company's streaming software, turned on their Rokus to see a block of text. I, the owner of a cheap Roku TV in my bedroom, was among those who got stuck with the screen.
The message gave updated terms of service that made it harder for customers to take legal action against the company. Unless they agreed, users were blocked from access to the Roku menu and apps, essentially bricking their devices. The only way to opt out was to mail a letter to the company.
To Isaac Phillips, a software engineer in Tampa, Fla., this felt unfair. So he came up with a workaround to disconnect his Roku TV from the internet and use it as a normal TV without Roku's apps, which include Netflix, Hulu and other streaming services.
"It should belong to whoever paid for it," Mr. Phillips said. "To lock somebody out of it completely just doesn't seem right. It's pretty unacceptable."
Also this month, Roku announced a security breach involving about 15,000 user accounts. The victims' login credentials had been illegally obtained through a breach of another company's servers and were used to get into Roku accounts to buy streaming subscriptions, according to Roku.
"Like many companies, Roku updates its terms of service from time to time," the company said in a statement, adding that the change was unrelated to the breach.
Roku's no-good month stirred discussions in online forums about what it means when a company can essentially deactivate the device you paid for. That's similar to how companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft can decide to stop issuing software updates for older devices, which gradually degrades their performance.
It's a lesson we have to learn and relearn. Companies, even those that say they strive to delight us and make our lives better, cater to their own interests. In reality, the tech products we buy can evolve to keep protecting those interests -- and the hoops we have to jump through to gain some control are often impractical. Here's a reminder of what to remember.
We don't really own our tech products
More than a decade ago, when we bought a TV it was just that -- a big screen that let you plug into it whatever you wanted. Nowadays, the vast majority of TVs connect to the internet and run the manufacturer's operating system and apps. Even though you bought the TV, the software component, a major part of what makes the product work, remains controlled by the company.
Changes to the product's software interface and data collection practices can happen at any moment. In extreme examples, a device can stop working. In 2020, for instance, Amazon deactivated the Echo Look, a camera that helped people organize their wardrobes. It issued a promotional credit for owners to buy a different Amazon gadget that lacked similar features.
The less extreme, more common situation is when companies stop supporting older products because they need to sell new gadgets. Apple's original Apple Watch from 2015, for example, no longer gets software updates and now barely works.
This issue is not new but has grown more problematic as more of our devices rely on apps and internet connections, said Nathan Proctor, a director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization. With computers, consumers could modify their machines by installing a different operating system. But with many other types of electronics with locked-down software systems, from streaming devices to e-book readers, those modifications are typically not possible.
"When you get to the core of it, do you even own it anymore?" he said.
Consumers lack protection
In a nutshell, Roku's terms of service have long required customers to agree to resolve any legal disputes through a private forum, the process known as mandatory arbitration, which can prevent consumers who share the same complaints from banding together to file lawsuits. The updated terms added language that shields the company from so-called mass arbitrations, where lawyers could file hundreds of thousands of individual arbitration claims, a tactic to fight back against arbitration clauses.
Mandatory arbitration clauses have become an industry standard. The terms of service for companies including Sony PlayStation, Vizio and Hulu include similar language about arbitration, and those companies also require consumers to mail a letter to opt out of those terms.
Roku customers can opt out of the revised terms and continue to use their products, but the process is not intuitive. First, they must hit the "agree" button on the terms of service screen. Then, within 30 days, they must mail a letter asking to opt out of the terms, along with a copy of the receipt for their Roku product, to Roku's general counsel at 1701 Junction Court, Suite 100, San Jose, Calif. 95112.
A Roku spokesman also provided a list of steps for those who wish to use their Roku TVs as normal TVs without an internet connection. It involves pressing a button or pinhole on the back of the TV to reset the software and skipping the step to set up the internet connection.
Why is it harder to opt out than it is to opt in? Because the companies are legally allowed to do this.
I suggest that Roku customers follow those steps to opt out of the new terms and hold on to what little power they have. I, for one, took this opportunity to disconnect my Roku TV from the internet and plug in a different streaming device with less onerous terms, an old Apple TV. As for a letter to opt out, I plan to use the A.I. chatbot ChatGPT to draft a testy note.
Separately, the Roku customers that were especially vulnerable in recent weeks were the 15,000 affected by a cyberattack known as "credential stuffing." Hackers obtained user names and passwords that were leaked elsewhere and reused them to log in to Roku accounts. The lesson here is to create a strong, unique password for every internet account you own and never reuse it for another site.
The fine print: Tech companies are not our friends
Like many tech companies, Roku has marketed itself as a company with consumers' interests at heart. Its website, embellished with wholesome photos of families watching TV, invites you to join the millions of people saving money by cutting the cord. Its streaming devices, including its $ 20 streaming stick and $ 290 55-inch TV, are also relatively inexpensive.
But any successful business exists to make money, not friends, and Roku's aggressive moves this month should make that crystal clear.
With Roku and similarly inexpensive streaming products like Google's $ 30 Chromecast and Amazon's $ 40 Fire TV stick, you are largely subsidizing the purchase of the product by sharing your data with advertisers, said Jen Caltrider, a director at Mozilla who researches companies' privacy policies.
But Roku is a bigger offender, as it collects much more information than it needs to provide a device that runs streaming apps, including information about your employment, education and religious beliefs, she said.
"Their privacy policy is a shining example of a terrible privacy policy for a consumer," Ms. Caltrider said. "They are a data-hoovering company."

Hollywood Actors Go Gaming: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Onscreen stars have increasingly been going virtual. Jodie Comer and David Harbour are making their video game debuts in a remake of the 1992 horror game Alone in the Dark.
A stream of actors who built their careers in Hollywood are making their digital presence felt in video games, a once stigmatized medium that is increasingly seen as a unique storytelling platform with the ability to reach large audiences.
Some are voice acting, transferring skills they may have honed in animated movies or TV shows, while others are contributing their likenesses through advanced motion-capture technology that can replicate furrowed brows and crinkled cheeks.
Last year, Cameron Monaghan led Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Megan Fox portrayed a character in Mortal Kombat 1, and Idris Elba and Keanu Reeves provided the backbone of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.
In this month's remake of the 1992 horror game Alone in the Dark, both Jodie Comer, who won an Emmy for "Killing Eve" and a Tony for "Prima Facie," and David Harbour, known for his work on "Stranger Things," are making their video game debuts. They are among the group of actors meeting younger generations where they already are.
"I hope that people are still watching two-hour movies decades from now, but I know they will be playing video games," Harbour said in an email.
In a behind-the-scenes video by the game's publisher, Comer said that working on the movie "Free Guy," set in a fictionalized video game, gave her a newfound appreciation of the industry. "It's so incredible to be able to kind of step out of what you usually do and explore something new, and kind of challenge yourself," she said.
In Alone in the Dark, Comer's character and the private investigator she hires, played by Harbour, explore a psychiatric hospital to uncover the truth behind a recent disappearance. Both are playable characters, with distinct cut scenes and dialogue.
Mikael Hedberg, the game's creative director, said that when the characters reunite after being separated, the player gets immediate relief because of an actual sense of recognition.
"Everyone has some level of parasocial relationship to celebrities where maybe they feel like your friend," Hedberg said.
The migration to video games is happening for several reasons, including leaps in technology that have reduced the disconnect between real-life and digital performances.
Convenience is another factor. Filming a live-action feature like "Dune: Part Two" can require actors to spend weeks in the deserts of Abu Dhabi. Motion-capture sessions for games can often be completed minutes away from an actor's Los Angeles home.
Bringing in known actors also enables studios to engage with people who might not otherwise be interested in their games. The indie game Open Roads, a mother-daughter road trip that releases this month, features the voices of Keri Russell and Kaitlyn Dever.
"If you saw David Harbour and Jodie Comer were starring in a new 'Alone in the Dark' horror film, you'd probably go see it," said Michael Csurics, the game's casting and voice director.
A known presence can drastically increase a game's reach. For big-budget games, screen actors are a small vote of confidence. For indie games, they can be an all-or-nothing bet. "Having a celebrity definitely tilts the scales on a budget," Csurics said.
At last year's Game Awards, one studio revealed its space-faring game Exodus by bringing onstage the Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey, who promised that his first video game character would "have a unique relationship with every player." Later in the ceremony, the real-time strategy game Stormgate was introduced by Simu Liu, fresh off his work in "Barbie."
Hollywood actors have participated in video games before this more noticeable trend. In 2008, Liam Neeson portrayed the protagonist's father in the postapocalyptic Fallout 3. Martin Sheen voiced the Illusive Man, a space paramilitary leader, in 2010's Mass Effect 2 and its 2012 sequel.
Movie and TV actors who have crossed over into video games note the similarities of performing in either medium. Karen Fukuhara joined the cast of The Callisto Protocol, a 2022 horror survival game, a few years after starring as Kimiko in "The Boys," a satirical superhero series.
Fukuhara said that she had "imagined a video game casting to be like, OK, just act like you're in a war zone or act like you're shooting at someone," but that she was surprised how much the experience "felt like a scene."
Ultimately, acting is acting.
"I write down and I build a character in the same way as I would in any role," said Melanie Liburd, who was on "This Is Us" before being cast as a main character in last year's Alan Wake II.
Although it can be exhilarating to see the acting lines blur, it is primarily happening in one direction. On-camera actors are easily slotted into games. But prominent video game actors like Yuri Lowenthal and Troy Baker have struggled to be cast in live-action stories.
"Oh, you were in the, you know, the biggest game that came out last year," said Lowenthal, who has played Spider-Man as well as characters in the Saints Row, Diablo and Prince of Persia series. "But you won't even be seen for a co-star on a TV show."
The shift comes as film studios and streaming services are investing in gaming. Netflix has a free game library built into every subscription, and Annapurna Pictures has published several lauded games, including Kentucky Route Zero and Outer Wilds. The director James Gunn, who is now managing the DC Comics universe for Warner Bros., has stated that he wants to cast actors who can play the same role in TV, film, video games and animation.
"When you try to pigeonhole or overly define art, it is by nature limited and boring," said Monaghan, who was a lead actor on 11 seasons of "Shameless" before wielding lightsabers in two popular Star Wars games.
Actors describe the experience of filming on a motion-capture stage as somewhere between theater and movies. Surrounded by at least a dozen cameras in a blank white room with minimalist sets, actors wear skintight suits covered in dots that help the system pick up their movements. Crew members observe from a distance and often render performances in real time.
Some actors have found the experience liberating, including Shannon Woodward, who was Ellie's girlfriend in the postapocalyptic game The Last of Us Part II.
"I'm not concerned if something is a bad angle for my chin," said Woodward, who built her career on television shows such as "Raising Hope" and "Westworld." "I can fully concentrate on how to represent this story and be present in this moment."
For younger actors, video games are already a part of their everyday lives. Liu said in a video by the studio behind Stormgate that it was exciting to voice a character for developers that once worked on StarCraft and Age of Empires, the real-time strategy games he played in the late 1990s.
Transitioning from video games to movies is considerably harder.
Colleen O'Shaughnessey, who has voiced Tails in Sonic the Hedgehog games for the past decade, was the only actor to reprise her role for the live-action movie in 2020. She said she did not know she was cast for the 2022 sequel until it was publicly announced by the studio.
O'Shaughnessey said she told her agents at the time that playing Tails "would be a huge win for me, but this would be a ginormous win for the entire voice-over community."
Despite the challenge longtime game actors face, many encouraged the recent arrival of more famous on-camera actors. Lowenthal said he would not have had the opportunity to do voice work on the "Afro Samurai" mini-series and movie if Samuel L. Jackson had not been behind the project.
"You can look at it, like, oh, that person took my job," Lowenthal said. "Or you could look at it as that person gave me a job."
Unlike in other mediums, gaming transforms the viewer into an active participant.
Harbour said that video games carried potential for artistry, social commentary and emotional catharsis, and that he joined Alone in the Dark because it "seemed fertile soil for an imaginative retelling and the opportunity to actually take a chance."
Abubakar Salim, who acted in the game Assassin's Creed Origins and the TV show "Raised by Wolves," is now making his own game, Tales of Kenzera: Zau, about a shaman trying to reclaim his father's spirit in a world inspired by Bantu traditions. Salim wants people to go on a journey of grief and beauty.
"The experience that I wanted to deliver had to be a game," he said.

Still Something Weird In the Neighborhood: [Review]

Full text: This overstuffed entry in the franchise is an eclectic, enjoyable barrage of nonsense.
How many spirits can "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" fit in a firehouse? This overstuffed, erratically funny entry in the 40-year franchise crams in four main characters from the original 1984 blockbuster, six characters from the 2021 Oklahoma-set spinoff, "Ghostbusters: Afterlife," and introduces three new occultists along with an assortment of ghosts, poltergeists, horned phantoms and miniature marshmallow men. At one point, a dozen or so heroes amass at the old Ghostbusters headquarters in Manhattan to protect a storage trap of ghouls that has, like the movie itself, gotten perilously sardined.
In the scenes where the director, Gil Kenan, who wrote the script with Jason Reitman, ponders what it might feel like to let the dead dematerialize for good, the film seems to be asking its fan base if it's ready to release Bill Murray's weary parapsychologist, Peter Venkman, from haunting the series when his soul clearly isn't in it.
"Afterlife" introduced the estranged daughter of Harold Ramis's Egon Spengler, a single mother named Callie (Carrie Coon), and her teenage children, Phoebe (Mckenna Grace) and Trevor (Finn Wolfhard). After the death of their paterfamilias, the family fended off his killer, the Sumerian deity Gozer, with a helpful boost from a high school physics teacher named Gary (Paul Rudd); two young pals, Lucky (Celeste O'Connor) and Podcast (Logan Kim) -- yes, Podcast; and the first generation of Ghostbusters, Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), Dr. Venkman (Murray) and the sassy secretary, Janine (Annie Potts).
Now, the Oklahomies (even the unrelated children!) have relocated to Manhattan to speed around town harpooning wild ghosts from the Ectomobile, that beloved vintage hearse. In New York, the posse meets an ancient languages expert (Patton Oswalt), a paranormal engineer (James Acaster, a kooky English comic making his big-screen Hollywood debut) and an in-over-his-head huckster (Kumail Nanjiani) who inherits a nasty little spherical cryptogram with a very bad thing locked inside that's yearning to unleash a fatal attack of the shivers -- a neat idea that, in execution, just looks like a Roland Emmerich disaster movie.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
My fingers have taken to their death bed simply typing out the basics. Yet, "Frozen Empire" is an eclectic, enjoyable barrage of nonsense -- a circus act that kicks off with a Robert Frost poem and climaxes with Ray Parker Jr.'s titular synth banger. Each scene gets laughs. Strung together, they sputter along with the fragmentary logic of a dream: Characters vanish at key moments and then reappear unexpectedly covered in goo. A demon goes to a vape shop. Once, I could swear the fire station's brass pole was smelted down. A few beats later it was back in place.
And the subplots are so gauzy and intangible that you're not sure if they're real. Is Phoebe, lonely and 15, trying to connect romantically with a pretty blond ghost (Emily Alyn Lind)? Are Callie and Gary actually dating or was that a buddy-buddy fist bump about the time they hooked up as demon dogs? Is 18-year-old Trevor's entire story arc just that he wants to drive the Ectomobile?
Grace, as Dr. Spengler's geeky granddaughter, bears much of the mechanics. She can really act, and her Phoebe is quirky and cerebral with an intriguing tickle of goth. You can see hints that the series would be game to have her shoulder the whole thing in a kiddie comedy spin on the "Conjuring" franchise, with Phoebe poking into fresh ghost stories while exploring her own attraction to the Great Beyond.
Perhaps that might have happened if the franchise hadn't been scarred by the internet flame wars over the 2016 all-female reboot (which does not exist in this timeline). But the film seems spooked to stray from its touchstones: the particle streams, the New York Public Library, Slimer and Murray rattling their chains. At least it reworks them in ways that make us chuckle, like when tiny maggoty versions of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man torture each other with cigarette lighters, or when Paul Rudd recites the Ghostbusters theme song with utter sincerity, as if he were convincing his therapist that busting does make him feel good.
Kenan and Reitman seem to accept that the core audience is over 30. No one younger would giggle as hard as I did at a Discman possessed by an evil Spin Doctors CD. Yet, the nostalgia works best when it captures the rude tone -- not the totems -- of classic 1980s comedies. The family has an incuriosity about one another's lives that feels refreshing, a throwback to a time when parents could quip about their kids getting tattoos. And Kenan deftly modulates the tension, toggling between screeching bombast and an eerie hush.
It's all pleasant enough in a warm-bath-of-ectoplasm kind of way that by the time things wound around to the familiar sight of the Ghostbusters engulfed in a throng of cheering civilians, I felt a flush of futility that I'd bothered to question any of the confusion that herded us toward the inevitable. At risk of provoking Benjamin Franklin's ghost, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and proton packs.

Len Sirowitz, 91, Whose Bold and Offbeat Ads Captured an Era, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An award-winning agency art director, he brought a striking visual touch to campaigns for the Volkswagen Beetle, Sara Lee and Sony in the 1960s as well as to the antiwar and antinuclear movements.
Len Sirowitz, an award-winning advertising art director whose creative work in the 1960s included memorable print ads for the Volkswagen Beetle -- like one declaring, "Ugly is only skin-deep" -- and a campaign for Mobil in which a car was dropped off a 10-story building to make a point about the perils of speeding, died on March 4 at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.
His daughter, Laura Sirowitz, confirmed the death.
Mr. Sirowitz joined the influential Doyle Dane Bernbach advertising agency, known as DDB, in 1959, at 27, and spent the next 11 years at the firm conceiving the look of ads for numerous accounts with wit and passion.
"It was quite early in my career that I began to realize that my message needed to not only be bold and daring, but it must stem from the truth ... and touch people's emotions," he told Dave Dye, who runs the advertising blog From the Loft, in 2015.
Volkswagen was perhaps Mr. Sirowitz's most important account, and the homely Beetle, nicknamed the "Bug," was his and copywriter Robert Levenson's automotive muse. Their collaborations for the German car maker included the ad "Will We Ever Kill the Bug?" in which they positioned a Beetle turned on its roof, like a dead bug. The answer to the question: "Never." (Though, after a few shots of the car, its roof collapsed.)
The pair also devised an ad that showed a motley Beetle constructed of green and beige fenders, a blue hood and a turquoise door, which were cobbled together from models between 1958 and 1964. The ad stressed the ease with which owners could find parts.
For Sara Lee, Mr. Sirowitz and Mr. Levenson created a TV commercial in which people dealt with annoyances like haircuts and traffic jams, then consoled themselves with a piece of the company's cake, introducing a soon-to-be enduring jingle: "Everybody doesn't like something / But nobody doesn't like Sara Lee."
For Mobil's public service newspaper and TV ads about highway safety, Mr. Sirowitz illustrated how crashing at 60 miles per hour would have the same impact as a car dropping from 10 stories. "And it will get you to exactly the same place -- the morgue," the narrator said.
Another TV ad for Mobil showed a couple canoodling in a car as the man drives against the blinding lights of oncoming traffic, eventually leading to a crash. A narrator says: "We at Mobil sell gasoline and oil. We're in favor of driving and love, but not at the same time."
And for the Better Vision Institute, an association of lens and frame manufacturers, Mr. Sirowitz produced dozens of promotions that ran in Life magazine persuading people to have their eyes examined more often. One particularly dramatic ad ran in all-black with copy by Leon Meadows reading, "This is how yellow daisies in a green pasture against a blue sky look to many Americans."
Bob Isherwood, a former worldwide creative director of Saatchi & Saatchi, called Mr. Sirowitz a "hero art director" for his flow of fresh ideas and different approaches.
"It was just an idea that he put on the page," he said in a phone interview. "When you see ads like that you think, 'Oh, God, I wish I had done that."'
Leonard Sirowitz was born on June 25, 1932, in Brooklyn. His father, Abraham Sirowitz, immigrated from Ukraine in 1905 and held various jobs, including taxi driver and jewelry polisher. His mother, Sadie (Schoenwetter) Sirowitz, ran the home.
Mr. Sirowitz's passion for drawing led to studies at the Art Students League of New York in Manhattan at age 12 and, two years later, his acceptance to the High School of Music and Art (now the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts). There, he met his future wife, Myrna Florman, a music student known as Mickey, when he was 17 and she was 14.
Mr. Sirowitz graduated in 1953 from the Pratt Institute, where he earned a bachelor's degree in advertising. He spent the next two years in the Army, mostly at Fort Dix in New Jersey, and he married Miss Florman during his service in January 1955. She survives him, along with his daughter; a son, Michael; and one grandson.
After his Army discharge, Mr. Sirowitz worked at the L.W. Frohlich pharmaceutical ad agency as well as Grey Advertising, CBS and Channel 13, the public TV station in New York.
In addition to working for DDB's commercial clients like Sony, where Mr. Sirowitz created a whimsical campaign based on the portability of its four-inch-wide TV, he also took on political causes as a volunteer.
A full-page newspaper ad in 1965 for the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy showed a cockroach against a white background with the headline: "The Winner of World War III."
Another ad in 1968, for the Coalition for a Democratic Alternative, carried, in giant letters, the headline "For what?" Below it, text by Dave Reider, a copywriter, described the hopelessness of the Vietnam War, demanded that President Lyndon B. Johnson step down and argued for Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota to be the Democratic nominee for president.
Mr. Sirowitz was DDB's senior vice president and associate creative director when he left in 1970 to form his own agency, Harper Rosenfeld Sirowitz as co-chairman and co-creative director. (It was renamed numerous times over the years.) By then he had been voted art director of the year for 1968 and 1970 in national polls by Ad Weekly. He was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1985.
His agency's clients included Swissair, McDonald's, Smith Corona and Royal Caribbean Cruises. Still, in 1995, the firm closed after losing several accounts, and Mr. Sirowitz joined the agency Ryan Drossman & Partners as vice chairman.
He soon retired and returned to the Art Students League, where he drew large-format, charcoal nude portraits four days a week until the start of the pandemic.
"I strive for bold, dramatic interpretations of the model's pose, drawn with spontaneous sweeping lines, and most importantly it should be part of a strong, well-designed composition," he told the institution's magazine, Lines from the League, in its 2012-13 issue.
His composition style came through clearly in his ad campaigns, including one in 1991 for America West Airlines, in which he cast the improvisational comedian Jonathan Winters -- looking tough and wearing camouflage -- in a parody of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who had recently commanded U.S. troops in the Gulf War.
The ad declared, "Announcing Air Superiority for Civilians," and offered airfares discounted by up to 40 percent.
The campaign, however, was rebuked by the organization Veterans of Foreign Wars for being in poor taste, and America West soon after filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
"To me, great advertising should make your palms sweat," Mr. Sirowitz told The Associated Press. "America West is the smallest of the major airlines. We wanted to do to the kind of advertising that would put them on the map in one fell swoop."

Altman Reasserts Control of OpenAI and Regains a Seat on Its Board: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Altman, whose sudden firing and rehiring in the fall shocked Silicon Valley, was among several new additions to the board announced on Friday.
The conclusion of an investigation into the chaotic firing of Sam Altman from OpenAI more than three months ago represented a resounding victory for the high-profile chief executive as he moves to reassert control of the artificial intelligence company he helped to create.
OpenAI, in a news conference on Friday, said that Mr. Altman, who returned to OpenAI just five days after he was pushed out in November, did not do anything that justified his removal and would regain the one role at the company that still eluded him: a seat on the company's board of directors.
Mr. Altman's ouster stunned Silicon Valley and imperiled the future of one of the tech industry's most influential start-ups. It also called into question whether OpenAI -- with or without Mr. Altman in charge -- was ready to carry the banner for the tech industry's rabid focus on artificial intelligence.
When he returned to OpenAI in November, Mr. Altman did not regain his board seat while agreeing to an investigation of his behavior and the board's actions. Two members who voted for his removal agreed to step down; their replacements, from outside the company, oversaw the investigation by the law firm, WilmerHale. Bret Taylor, chairman of OpenAI's board, said during the news conference that the highly anticipated report about the episode was finished, but the company did not release the report.
The company said that the law firm's report found that OpenAI's board acted within its broad discretion to terminate Mr. Altman, but also found that his conduct did not mandate removal.
"The special committee recommended and the full board expressed their full confidence in Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman," Mr. Taylor said, referring to Greg Brockman, the company president who quit in protest after Mr. Altman was removed. "We are excited and unanimous in our support for Sam and Greg."
OpenAI also moved to address concerns about a lack of diversity on the board by adding three women as directors: Sue Desmond-Hellmann, the former chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Nicole Seligman, the former general counsel of Sony; and Fidji Simo, the chief executive of Instacart.
Mr. Taylor, who was one of the replacements named to OpenAI's board in November, said the board would continue to expand.
With the report and the additions to the board, OpenAI's leadership hoped to move past the controversy of Mr. Altman's ouster. The incident raised myriad questions about his leadership and the San Francisco company's unusual structure -- a nonprofit board that oversees a for-profit company.
But because it has not released the report, OpenAI has left many questions unanswered about the company. Some insiders have asked whether Mr. Altman had too much control over how the investigation was handled.
"As we told the investigators, deception, manipulation, and resistance to thorough oversight should be unacceptable," Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley, the two OpenAI board members who left late last year, said in a statement. "We hope the new board does its job in governing OpenAI and holding it accountable to the mission."
Mr. Taylor appeared alongside Mr. Altman at the news conference on Friday. After announcing the new board members, he said the review found that the previous board acted in good faith in removing Mr. Altman but did not anticipate the challenges that would arise from his dismissal.
"The review determined the board's decision did not arise from concern regarding product safety or security," Mr. Taylor said. "It was simply a breakdown in trust between the board and Mr. Altman."
After Mr. Taylor completed his prepared remarks, Mr. Altman praised the resilience of the company and its partners during and after his removal. "I am pleased this whole thing is over," he said.
OpenAI provided a six-paragraph summary of the report. It said that WilmerHale reviewed 30,000 documents and conducted dozens of interviews, including with OpenAI's previous board members.
It found that the previous board was accurate in its rationale and public explanation for firing Mr. Altman for not being "consistently candid in his communications with the board." It also said that the board didn't anticipate that its action would destabilize the company.
The company said that WilmerHale gave oral briefings on the report, which will not be publicly released, to Mr. Taylor and Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary who was also added to the board in November.
Mr. Taylor said OpenAI had made several changes meant to improve the way the company was run, including new governance guidelines for the board, a new conflict of interest policy and a whistle-blower hotline.
OpenAI's summary of the report did not provide insight into the concerns that the company's senior leaders brought to the previous board about Mr. Altman. Before his dismissal, Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist, and Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer, expressed worries about Mr. Altman's management style, including what was characterized as his history of manipulative behavior, The New York Times has reported.
Dr. Sutskever, through a lawyer, has called those claims "false." Ms. Murati said in a company Slack post on Thursday that she shared the same feedback with the board that she had provided directly to Mr. Altman, but said she never reached out to the board to share those concerns.
"I am happy that the independent review has concluded and we can all move forward united," Ms. Murati said on Friday in a post on X, formerly called Twitter.
OpenAI is still being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission over the board's actions and the possibility that Mr. Altman misled investors. Companies that hire outside law firms often turn over the report to public investigators after completion. A spokeswoman for OpenAI's board declined to say whether it would provide the report to the S.E.C.
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
OpenAI, which was valued at more than $ 80 billion in its latest financing round, sits at the forefront of generative A.I., technologies that can generate text, images and sounds. Many believe that generative A.I. could transform the technology industry as thoroughly as the web browser did about three decades ago. Others worry that the technology could cause serious harm, helping to spread online disinformation, replacing countless jobs and maybe even threatening the future of humanity.
After OpenAI released the online chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022, Mr. Altman became the face of the industry's push toward generative A.I. About a year later, the board unexpectedly dismissed him, saying it no longer had confidence in his ability to run the company.
The board had shrunk to six people: three founders and three independent members. Along with the three outsiders, Dr. Sutskever, one of OpenAI's founders, voted to remove Mr. Altman as chief executive and chairman of the board, saying without providing specifics that he had not been "consistently candid in his communications."
Mr. Brockman, another founder, resigned from the company in protest. Days later, Dr. Sutskever said he regretted his decision to remove Mr. Altman and effectively stepped down from the board, leaving three independent members standing in opposition to Mr. Altman.
OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, before Mr. Altman created a for-profit subsidiary three years later and raised $ 1 billion from Microsoft. The board of the nonprofit, whose stated mission was to build A.I. for the benefit of humanity, maintained complete control over the new subsidiary. Investors, including Microsoft, had no legal say in who ran the company.
In an effort to resolve the turmoil and return Mr. Altman to the company, he and the board agreed to replace two members with Mr. Taylor, who is a former Salesforce executive. But Mr. Altman was not reinstated to the board. Mr. Taylor and Mr. Summers were charged with overseeing the investigation into Mr. Altman and his dismissal.
Microsoft, a close partner of OpenAI, has a board observer position, which is filled by Dee Templeton, the company's vice president, technology and research partnerships. Microsoft declined on Friday to comment on the board and report.
The new board faced criticism from corporate governance experts because of its lack of diversity. Mr. Taylor told The Times in November that he would fill out the board by adding "qualified, diverse candidates" who embodied "the fullness of what this mission represents, which is going to span technology, A.I. safety policy."

A Popular Video Game Lets Women Take the Field: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: MLB The Show 24 will feature a career mode that allows gamers to create a female player and steer her journey to the big leagues. The game draws on the experiences of female baseball players.
For the first time, women will don Major League Baseball jerseys in MLB The Show, the long-running popular video game.
MLB The Show 24 will debut the option to create and play a female player in a reinvented version of the game's career mode, Road to the Show, in which gamers direct a custom character's ascent from the minors to the big leagues. The game's developer, Sony San Diego Studio, announced the new mode Tuesday.
The game, which comes out March 19, calls the new career mode Road to the Show: Women Pave Their Way. It includes a story line that follows the rise of two women into the major leagues and touches on the unique challenges they face, according to Sony San Diego Studio.
MLB The Show joins other high-profile sports video game franchises that have moved to include women, such as FIFA (now EA Sports FC) and NBA 2K. But the gender dynamics in baseball are far more complicated, because most women and girls play softball instead.
Some hoped MLB The Show 24 would help change that.
"I think that in the United States especially, we're brainwashed to think that boys play baseball and girls play softball, when in reality both exist in both worlds," said Veronica Alvarez, manager of the U.S.A. Baseball Women's National Team, which will compete in this year's Women's Baseball World Cup.
Ms. Alvarez, a former national team player herself, and some of her players provided Sony with input for the game's development.
Women playing baseball is hardly new -- Toni Stone is credited with becoming the first woman to play alongside men in the Negro Leagues, and women's baseball leagues have come and gone in the United States over the years. The movie "A League of Their Own" popularized a professional women's league that sprang up during World War II.
Despite societal expectations to pursue softball, women are staking a greater claim in the male-dominated sport of baseball.
There are no women in the major leagues, but a growing number of girls are playing the sport, whether alongside boys or even on all-girl teams. A few have even gone on to play on men's teams in college.
Some, like Ms. Alvarez, have found careers in coaching minor league teams. In 2020, Kim Ng became the first general manager of a major league team.
The Atlantic League, an independent minor league that works with Major League Baseball, recently welcomed its first female player, Kelsie Whitmore, a 25-year-old pitcher. Her personal story is drawn upon in Road to the Show: Women Paving Their Way.
"It's becoming more common for women to make it farther and farther into the sport," said Olivia Pichardo, 20, who last year became the first woman to play N.C.A.A. Division I college baseball.
Ms. Pichardo, who grew up playing MLB The Show and shared her personal experience with the developers, hoped to see it empower young girls to see baseball as a viable option.
Lisa Fernandez, a U.C.L.A. coach and softball pitcher whose three gold medals earned her a place in the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Hall of Fame, said the representation of women in a baseball video game showed how far they had come since Title IX opened the doors for them in college sports in 1972.
"I think it just makes a statement," Ms. Fernandez said, though she noted that women still had a long way to go to have the same professional opportunities men do, whether they play baseball, softball or another sport.
Ms. Alvarez, 40, said the Colorado Silver Bullets, an all-women professional team that briefly competed against men in the 1990s, were the only example of women in baseball she could recall in her childhood.
"I saw one game on TV, and that was the only representation I ever saw when I was growing up of a girl or a woman playing baseball outside of obviously me and the only one girl in the Little League that I played in," Ms. Alvarez said.
She had not known that a women's national team existed until she was an adult, when by chance it popped up after she searched Google for the Silver Bullets. "And that led me to U.S.A. Baseball, which meant I got to play and extend my career for eight more years," Ms. Alvarez said, adding, "It shows you the importance of seeing someone that looks like you do it."
A more inclusive video game can carry that kind of power, too.
Jillian Albayati, 19, a baseball pitcher and a member of the national team, said MLB The Show was wildly popular among young players. It's one of the few video games she has played, she said.
"It lets me see how far I can really go," Ms. Albayati said, picturing her thoughts if she had seen women in the game as a child. "It gives me even bigger dreams that I already have.
"It makes me believe that they can come true."

Full text: "Oppenheimer" is the best picture favorite, but the best actress race is full of suspense. Our expert predicts which films and artists will get trophies on Sunday.
Best Picture
"American Fiction"
"Anatomy of a Fall"
"Barbie"
"The Holdovers"
"Killers of the Flower Moon"
"Maestro"
✓"Oppenheimer"
"Past Lives"
"Poor Things"
"The Zone of Interest"
Let's be real: The best picture race is locked up for "Oppenheimer." Christopher Nolan gave Oscar voters an IMAX-sized helping of their favorite genre -- the great-man-of-history biopic -- and after the movie made nearly a billion dollars worldwide, its path to the top Oscar was clear.
Still, why not add some stakes to the situation? See whether you can sabotage the people in your Oscar pool by convincing them that a dark-horse candidate can topple Nolan's mighty contender.
Suggest, for example, that "The Holdovers" may mirror the little-film-that-could trajectory of "CODA" (though you'd better leave out that "The Holdovers" didn't win the top prize at the Producers Guild Awards, as "CODA" so tellingly did). Note that the expansive international contingent of the academy could swing things toward "Anatomy of a Fall" (though if that were the case, we would have seen signs of it at last month's BAFTA ceremony). Or mention that the path to best picture tends to go through the screenplay categories, and since "Oppenheimer" is in danger of losing a writing trophy to "American Fiction" or "Barbie," maybe those movies are the real threats.
Say anything you want! Have fun causing a little chaos. Just be sure to mark down "Oppenheimer" on your own ballot, because it's winning.
Best Director
Jonathan Glazer, "The Zone of Interest"
Yorgos Lanthimos, "Poor Things"
✓Christopher Nolan, "Oppenheimer"
Martin Scorsese, "Killers of the Flower Moon"
Justine Triet, "Anatomy of a Fall"
Though the 53-year-old Nolan has come to be regarded as the premier blockbuster director of his generation, one feat he still hasn't managed is winning an Academy Award. That will finally change this weekend, completing a journey that started 15 years ago when the Oscars expanded the amount of best picture nominees after his film "The Dark Knight" was snubbed in the two top categories. Now, Nolan will win both.
Best Actor
Bradley Cooper, "Maestro"
Colman Domingo, "Rustin"
Paul Giamatti, "The Holdovers"
✓Cillian Murphy, "Oppenheimer"
Jeffrey Wright, "American Fiction"
Giamatti has a "he's due" veteran narrative, and Cooper gave the sort of transformative performance that voters often flip for. But it's the "Oppenheimer" star Murphy who is best positioned to take this Oscar for holding down the huge ensemble of the best picture front-runner. Contenders who have won the SAG and BAFTA awards, as Murphy has, don't tend to falter at the finish line.
Best Actress
Annette Bening, "Nyad"
✓Lily Gladstone, "Killers of the Flower Moon"
Sandra Hüller, "Anatomy of a Fall"
Carey Mulligan, "Maestro"
Emma Stone, "Poor Things"
With so many of the top races sewn up, this will be Oscar night's most suspenseful major category. Stone dominates every scene of "Poor Things," but she already won the Oscar for "La La Land" and voters do factor that into the decision to bestow another. Though Gladstone may be the only chance at a win for the fading "Killers of the Flower Moon," hers would be a historic victory for Native American performers and she just won the SAG Award, typically this race's best predictor. I'm leaning Gladstone in what looks to be a photo finish.
Best Supporting Actor
Sterling K. Brown, "American Fiction"
Robert De Niro, "Killers of the Flower Moon"
✓Robert Downey Jr., "Oppenheimer"
Ryan Gosling, "Barbie"
Mark Ruffalo, "Poor Things"
Oscar voters love to see a movie star stretch, and after a decade spent suiting up for Marvel, Downey proved how limber he could still be with this seething dramatic performance as Oppenheimer's political rival, Lewis Strauss. It helps, too, that though his "Oppenhomies" Nolan and Murphy operated at something of a remove during awards season, Downey is the consummate Hollywood smoothie, winning over ballroom after ballroom with his warm and witty acceptance speeches. Thrice-nominated, this is his time to finally bring home the gold.
Best Supporting Actress
Emily Blunt, "Oppenheimer"
Danielle Brooks, "The Color Purple"
America Ferrera, "Barbie"
Jodie Foster, "Nyad"
✓Da'Vine Joy Randolph, "The Holdovers"
Randolph has so firmly swept this awards season that I halfway expect her to repeat next year, simply out of habit. Her performance as a grieving cook in "The Holdovers" is finely felt and gives voters their best opportunity to recognize a film that many of them loved. Her win is so certain that this might as well be the free space on your bingo card.
Best Original Screenplay
✓"Anatomy of a Fall"
"The Holdovers"
"May December"
"Maestro"
"Past Lives"
We've got a solid three-way race here. "Anatomy of a Fall" was strong enough to snag a prized best director nomination, and though it's got no shot at beating Nolan in that category, voters could reward it here instead. I've also heard from many members who are voting with their heart for either "Past Lives" or "The Holdovers." In the end, I project that the late-season momentum of "Anatomy of a Fall" will put the film over the top.
Best Adapted Screenplay
✓"American Fiction"
"Barbie"
"Oppenheimer"
"Poor Things"
"The Zone of Interest"
This, too, is a three-way race. The best picture winner almost always takes a screenplay trophy first, though the "Oppenheimer" sweep so far hasn't extended to this category. Meanwhile, "Barbie" had hoped to qualify as an original screenplay until the academy ruled it was an adapted work and must therefore compete in a tougher category. I project the ultimate winner will be "American Fiction," a well-liked movie about writing (based on Percival Everett's 2001 novel, "Erasure") that even pulled off a surprise victory in this race at the BAFTAs.
Best Animated Feature
"The Boy and the Heron"
"Elemental"
"Nimona"
✓"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"
"Robot Dreams"
The inventive blockbuster "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" won the Producers Guild Award but may be dinged by voters as the middle installment of a planned trilogy. (Though the first "Spider-Verse" won in this category, the only sequels that have been victorious were stand-alone "Toy Story" films.) It's going up against Hayao Miyazaki's "The Boy and the Heron," a highbrow pick that will be popular with international voters and has picked up trophies from BAFTA and the Golden Globes. I truly believe this contest is coin-flip close, though I'm giving the edge to "Spider-Verse."
Best Documentary Feature
"Bobi Wine: The People's President"
"The Eternal Memory"
"Four Daughters"
"To Kill a Tiger"
✓"20 Days in Mariupol"
Though it's tough to watch, with multiple scenes of death and dismemberment, "20 Days in Mariupol," about the Russian siege of the Ukrainian city, feels all the more vital in a year so filled with war and atrocity.
Best International Feature
"The Teachers' Lounge," Germany
"Io Capitano," Italy
"Perfect Days," Japan
"Society of the Snow," Spain
✓"The Zone of Interest," United Kingdom
Simply put, you should never bet against the best picture nominee in this category. Had France submitted "Anatomy of a Fall," we'd have a real race. Without it, "The Zone of Interest" wins in a rout.
Best Cinematography
"El Conde"
"Killers of the Flower Moon"
"Maestro"
✓"Oppenheimer"
"Poor Things"
The push to see "Oppenheimer" on the biggest IMAX screen possible added hundreds of millions to its box office totals and made its Oscar win for cinematography a foregone conclusion.
Best Original Score
"American Fiction"
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"
"Killers of the Flower Moon"
✓"Oppenheimer"
"Poor Things"
"Oppenheimer" has more score than most movies have minutes. It's hard to imagine this three-hour drama flying by without the maelstrom of Ludwig Goransson's music providing wall-to-wall accompaniment.
Best Song
"The Fire Inside" ("Flamin' Hot")
"I'm Just Ken" ("Barbie")
"It Never Went Away" ("American Symphony")
"Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)" ("Killers of the Flower Moon")
✓"What Was I Made For?" ("Barbie")
Though Ryan Gosling's live rendition of "I'm Just Ken" will almost certainly be an Oscar-ceremony highlight, it competes in this category against Billie Eilish's "Barbie" tune "What Was I Made For?" -- and Oscar voters love Billie Eilish, who previously won in this category for her James Bond song "No Time to Die." And this song is even better than that one!
Best Sound
"The Creator"
"Maestro"
"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One"
✓"Oppenheimer"
"The Zone of Interest"
There's room for a surprise here, as "The Zone of Interest" pulled off a BAFTA victory in this category for its subtle, unnerving soundscapes. Still, the gale-force pummel of "Oppenheimer" ought to win the day.
Best Editing
"Anatomy of a Fall"
"The Holdovers"
"Killers of the Flower Moon"
✓"Oppenheimer"
"Poor Things"
Up against four well-edited but hardly flashy nominees, the florid timeline-mixing of "Oppenheimer" offers voters a standout choice.
Best Production Design
✓"Barbie"
"Killers of the Flower Moon"
"Napoleon"
"Oppenheimer"
"Poor Things"
With its plastic-fantastic world full of ingeniously assembled dream houses, "Barbie" has a strong shot at winning a second Oscar here. Can it fend off "Poor Things," which picked up a BAFTA trophy for its surreal sets? This race will be close.
Best Costume Design
"Barbie"
"Killers of the Flower Moon"
"Napoleon"
"Oppenheimer"
✓"Poor Things"
"Barbie" had audiences dressing up to go to the theater and utterly dominated last year's crop of Halloween costumes. Still, Oscar voters have proven time and time again that when it comes to this category, they prefer a period piece with plenty of dramatic gowns. Knowing that, the eccentrically costumed "Poor Things" should prevail.
Best Makeup and Hairstyling
"Golda"
"Maestro"
"Oppenheimer"
✓"Poor Things"
"Society of the Snow"
Which is the more powerful prosthetic: Bradley Cooper's fake nose or Willem Dafoe's Frankenstein chin? The quite literal face-off between "Maestro" and "Poor Things" has confounded me: Voters typically prefer the transformation and aging on display in "Maestro," but "Poor Things" is the stronger across-the-board contender. If you want to play it safe, pick "Maestro." If you're more inclined to follow a hunch, as I am, then "Poor Things" is the spoiler.
Best Visual Effects
"The Creator"
✓"Godzilla Minus One"
"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"
"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One"
"Napoleon"
Could the nominee with the lowest budget win the visual-effects Oscar? I suspect "Godzilla Minus One," which cost only $ 15 million, could pull off an upset here: Its director, Takashi Yamazaki, and his effects team have made an endearing press push stateside, toting a Godzilla figurine to awards shows and wowing voters with everything the film was able to accomplish with so little.
Best Animated Short
"Letter to a Pig"
"Ninety-Five Senses"
"Our Uniform"
"Pachyderme"
✓"War Is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko"
Well-animated and emotionally obvious, the antiwar short "War Is Over!" has everything it takes to win over Oscar voters, including a closing-credits song from John Lennon.
Best Documentary Short
"The ABCs of Book Banning"
"The Barber of Little Rock"
"Island in Between"
✓"The Last Repair Shop"
"Nai Nai & Wai Po"
I wouldn't count out "The ABCs of Book Banning," especially since the director Sheila Nevins is the well-connected former president of HBO Documentary Films. But "The Last Repair Shop," about craftspeople working to repair the musical instruments lent at public schools, has plenty of real-world resonance and is much more artfully made.
Best Live-Action Short
"The After"
"Invincible"
"Knight of Fortune"
"Red, White and Blue"
✓"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar"
Wes Anderson could win his first Oscar for the Roald Dahl adaptation "The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar," though the things voters usually gravitate to in this race -- political resonance, tear-jerking emotion and a clear-cut message -- are not qualities that the highbrow "Henry Sugar" has in abundance. By contrast, "Red, White and Blue," which stars Brittany Snow as a young mother contemplating abortion, ticks every single box of a typical live-action short winner. This race will ultimately depend on whether voters watch all five nominees or just default to the biggest name.

Sci-Fi Epic That Existed Only in the Imagination: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: 'Jodorowsky's Dune' chronicles a director's determination to film his vision of the saga, one that would have included Mick Jagger and Gloria Swanson.
This week sees the release of "Dune: Part Two," the second installment in Denis Villeneuve's eye-popping adaptation of the 1965 Frank Herbert novel. "Dune" was also adapted in 1984, by David Lynch, who hated his version (or the cut that made it to theaters, anyhow) so much that he disavowed it.
Perhaps you've seen the Lynch version, which I find kind of charming in its flawed state. (Nobody should be that sweaty on the planet Arrakis.) But if you're heading to "Dune: Part Two" this weekend, you owe it to yourself to be acquainted with another "Dune" adaptation that doesn't technically exist and, somehow, is also larger than life.
I'm speaking of the "Dune" we glimpse in Frank Pavich's 2014 documentary "Jodorowsky's Dune" (streaming on Max). It chronicles the "Dune" adaptation that never happened, the bright dream of the avant-garde filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky (who did make "El Topo" and "The Holy Mountain").
"Jodorowsky's Dune" is a chronicle of a man -- to mix my literary allusions -- on a quixotic quest for his personal white whale. Jodorowsky was hired in 1974 to direct the adaptation, and his vision was gargantuan. Over the next several years, he worked with the producer Michel Seydoux (grand-uncle of actress Léa Seydoux, who appears in "Dune: Part Two") to wrangle artists, musicians and actors for the project. Pink Floyd was set to record some of the music. He wanted Salvador Dalí to play the emperor. (Dalí asked for $ 100,000 per hour on set; I'd wager Christopher Walken, the emperor in the new film, did not quite reach those heights.) Jodorowsky also wanted Gloria Swanson, Mick Jagger, Udo Kier, David Carradine, Orson Welles and more to star. Jodorowsky cast his 12-year-old son to play Paul Atreides, the role filled in this version by Timothée Chalamet. To judge by his screenplay, the film would have lasted 14 hours.
All of this is wild, but what makes the documentary so fascinating is the storyboards, which Jodorowsky created with the artist Jean (Moebius) Giraud -- 3,000 images that covered the entire film and are just as psychedelic as you might expect. The production ran out of money and Jodorowsky's vision never came to fruition. Eventually the film rights lapsed and were scooped up by Dino De Laurentiis, who, after his own long and winding road, hired Lynch.
The documentary is almost certainly the only cinematic version of Jodorowsky's "Dune" we'll ever see. Through interviews with a bevy of people who were involved or who admired what it might have been, the documentary makes the case, pretty compellingly, that even the nonexistent movie had an outsize influence on science fiction. And the film is a great peek into how miraculous it is that any movie ever gets made -- a fitting frame of mind to enter before seeing Villeneuve's epic.

'This Is as Living as Opera Can Get': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: In his "Europeras," Cage dismantled centuries of tradition and expectations, for musicians and audiences alike. A rare revival is coming to Detroit.
The start was typical: Oper Frankfurt in Germany asked John Cage to write an opera.
But the premiere, in 1987, was unlike anything in opera up to that point. Cage, an American maverick whose philosophical, socially conscious works at the time were based on chance, mapped out an elaborate scheme for a show that would bring the entirety of European opera onto the same stage -- at the same time.
It was called "Europeras 1 & 2," an enormous undertaking of controlled chaos, engineered with an eye toward history and populist reclamation, hence the title that implies both "Euro operas" and "your operas." Each element, its rollout determined by the I Ching, unfolded independently from all others: Singers performed arias unrelated to the instrumental accompaniment, which was unrelated to the scenic and lighting design, as well as stage directions. (Audience members also received varied plot synopses that read like opera Mad Libs.)
The public wasn't exactly equipped to receive what Cage had served them. Laura Kuhn, who runs the John Cage Trust and worked with him as he prepared "Europeras 1 & 2," wrote in her dissertation on the piece that the reception in Frankfurt varied from "overt enthusiasm to no less overt bewilderment or disdain."
But Cage kept going. At the Almeida Festival in 1990, he premiered "Europeras 3 & 4," which will receive a rare revival this week at Detroit Opera, in a production directed by Yuval Sharon. In Cage's series of works, which concluded with "Europera 5" in 1991, the whole became greater than its parts, with affection alongside the anarchy, and the feeling, Sharon said, that "this is as living as opera can get."
In Cage's time, there were those who appreciated what Cage was doing. As "Europeras 1 & 2" was arriving in the United States, the artist and critic Richard Kostelanetz wrote that "by running innocently amok in European culture, Cage has come as close as anyone to writing the Great American Opera, which is to say, a great opera that only an American could make."
Those who come to the "Europeras" devoted to the operatic canon may struggle with it. The experience of them is slippery: The more connoisseurs try to recognize fleeting melodies, the harder it is to see the bigger picture.
The "Europeras," Sharon said, are really a "forest of impressions and sounds," assembled from the scraps of opera history. (The original production featured 64 arias, stripped of their original context and set against a collage of other materials in ways that could be harmonious or not; no two performances are the same.) And navigating that forest can be a challenge.
"We're not necessarily trained to appreciate that freedom," Sharon said. Reception, he added, is often determined by an artist's intent, which informs how audiences think about what they see and hear. "But Cage isn't trying to say anything. It's a liberating perspective, but it's really foreign to how we think of the performing arts."
Each installment opens up those possibilities, but in different ways. "Europeras 1 & 2" was conceived on a grand scale, because it was written for a grand opera house. But successive commissions were smaller: The cast of 19 singers became six in "Europera 3," then just two in "4" and "5." An orchestral ensemble later became two pianos, then a Victrola and a piano.
Kuhn said Cage hadn't planned a trajectory for the works. But Sharon said that in the progressive reduction of forces, "it very clearly feels like there is a gradual stripping away of artifice." It also feels, he added, that Cage wanted "to get to the singing human at the core of opera."
Important to Cage, Kuhn said, was that the "Europeras" be recycled, in the sense that they require no new materials. They are meant to be performed using sets and costumes from an opera house's archive; when Sharon staged "1 & 2" with his company, the Industry, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at Sony Pictures Studios in 2018, he mined the studio's collection of golden age costumes and backdrops.
"The power of the locality is a huge part of what Cage is doing," Sharon said. "'Your' operas -- there's a sense of where you are located." In Detroit, he will be using archive pieces that may be familiar, but will be seen "in an entirely new context." A familiar costume from a work by Wagner, for example, might accompany an aria by Mozart.
Also in a new context will be some of the performers. "Europera 4" is an intimate recital for two singers. In Detroit they will be singers new to the work: the bass-baritone Davóne Tines and the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham.
The show is a step outside the comfort zone of Graham, a star more accustomed to stages like the Metropolitan Opera. There will be no orchestra supporting her, so she will be responsible for the pitch with which she starts each aria. (She chose her excerpts, but their order and relationship to other elements are left to chance.) "To make it as easy on myself as possible, I picked things that were in my DNA," she said, like Didon's farewell in Berlioz's "Les Troyens" and music by Handel and Mahler. "I'm singing four pieces that I can sing in my sleep."
Tonally, rhythmically, even physically, singers have nothing to lean on in Cage's operas. "He told them to practice with all sorts of things going on around them," Kuhn said, "whether it was balloons or plastic knives, and see if you can do your aria without making mistakes. If you can do that, while also carrying out your actions, that's the biggest part of it."
Achieving that requires dismantling much of how singers are taught to approach opera. "We often use our critical faculties to weigh whether something is good or beautiful, or whether the lighting is strong or atmospheric enough," Sharon said. "But the exercise in the 'Europeras' is to silence that voice of judgment. Anything is potentially beautiful, and you have to embrace what you cannot control."
His job, in preparing "Europeras 3 & 4," has been to help artists get to that point, behaving like a coach as much as a director to cultivate a Cagean ethos of trusting in the experience, and in one another.
"This piece is all about process," Sharon said. "The normal way that we think about any opera is so teleological. It's all about the finish line. But with Cage, the process is more important, and opening night will just be part of that. There will be no such thing as perfection; there will just be paying attention to everything that happens along the way."

Full text: The tech giant and its partner OpenAI were accused of infringing on copyrights to train A.I. technologies like the online chatbot ChatGPT.
Microsoft filed a motion in federal court on Monday that seeks to dismiss parts of a lawsuit brought by The New York Times Company.
The Times sued Microsoft and its partner OpenAI on Dec. 27, accusing the two companies of infringing on its copyrights by using its articles to train A.I. technologies like the online chatbot ChatGPT. Chatbots compete with the news outlet as a source of reliable information, the lawsuit said.
In its motion, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Microsoft argued that large language models, or L.L.M.s -- the technologies that drive chatbots -- did not supplant the market for news articles and other materials they were trained on.
The tech giant compared L.L.M.s to videocassette recorders, arguing that both are allowed under the law. "Despite The Times's contentions, copyright law is no more an obstacle to the L.L.M. than it was to the VCR (or the player piano, copy machine, personal computer, internet or search engine)," the motion read.
In the late 1970s, movie studios sued Sony over its Betamax VCR, arguing that it would allow people to illegally copy movies and television shows. But the courts ultimately found that making these copies for personal viewing was fair use under the law.
Microsoft's motion was similar to one made by OpenAI last week. Microsoft said three parts of the suit should be dismissed in part because The Times did not show actual harm.
The Times had argued, for example, that if readers use Microsoft's chatbot to research recommendations from the review site Wirecutter, which The Times owns, it loses revenue from users who would have clicked on its referral links. Microsoft argued that the Times lawsuit offered "no real-world facts suggesting meaningful diversion of revenue from Wirecutter."
Ian Crosby, a Susman Godfrey partner who is lead counsel for The Times in the case, said in a statement on Monday: "Microsoft doesn't dispute that it worked with OpenAI to copy millions of The Times's works without its permission to build its tools. Instead, it oddly compares L.L.M.s to the VCR even though VCR makers never argued that it was necessary to engage in massive copyright infringement to build their products."
Microsoft did not have an immediate comment.
The Times was the first major American media company to sue Microsoft and OpenAI over copyright issues related to its written works. Writers, computer coders and other groups have also filed copyright suits against companies that build generative A.I., technologies that generate text, images and other media.
Like other A.I. companies, Microsoft and OpenAI built their technology by feeding it enormous amounts of digital data, some of which is likely copyrighted. A.I. companies have claimed that they can legally use such material to train their systems without paying for it because it is public and they are not reproducing the material in its entirety.
In its suit, The Times included examples of OpenAI technology's reproducing excerpts from its articles almost word for word. Microsoft said training the technology on such articles was "fair use" under the law because chatbots were a "transformative" technology that created something new with copyrighted material. It did not, however, seek to dismiss arguments against "fair use," saying it would address these issues at a later time.

Can Hollywood Bounce Back?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Academy Awards ceremony, which this year will take place on March 10, traditionally provides a reliable moment of optimism for a perennially anxious industry. The Oscars are the climax of an awards season that's a prolonged exercise in collective congratulation, and in early March the rest of the year still looks bright. The Sundance Film Festival and its attendant bidding wars have wrapped up, offering nothing but promise and excitement. At the box office, the biggest bets of the year have typically not yet opened and thus have not yet bombed. Every unreleased movie on the schedule might yet be a great one. Every year feels as if it just might be the biggest year ever.
But not this year.
For Hollywood, 2023 was not so much a disaster as a preview of disasters to come. Sure, one of the big stories last year was the Barbenheimer phenomenon -- two celebrated hits that marched arm in arm toward a combined 21 Oscar nominations -- but everywhere else you look, the prognosis is grim.
The industry, still staggering back from the pandemic shutdowns, was hit with twin strikes that brought production to a halt for six months. Writers, actors and virtually the rest of Hollywood's work force were united in animus against the studio bosses, who, in their refusal to cut necessary deals, blithely cast themselves in the role of supervillain. That fury persists: Each new headline about the huge compensation package for Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive, or decisions by David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, to shelve entire projects for tax write-offs undergirds a prevailing narrative that the people who finance the movies are becoming the enemies of the people who make them.
All of this is happening as the industry seems to be realizing in unison that streaming services -- those wondrous platforms that were going to carry the town into the future like magic carpets -- maybe aren't a panacea after all. And hanging over all this anger and anxiety is the menace of artificial intelligence, which threatens every human part of the creative food chain, from the writers who pen scripts to the actors whose faces fill the screens to, theoretically, the studio executives whose jobs are piloting hits.
The year 2023 was a time of downsizing, diminishment, shelving, sidelining, retrenching, retreating and bet-hedging. And 2024 is the year of consequences. The plain fact is that, thanks to the strikes, there simply aren't enough movies and new shows in the pipeline to give the business the boom year it badly needs. (This weekend's big opening, "Dune: Part Two," was delayed from its original 2023 premiere date because of the strikes' disruption.) For Hollywood, it will take at least a full year for the supply lines to start flowing at capacity again -- and there are fewer supply lines than there used to be. Only five of the legacy movie companies still operate as traditional studios, and one of those, Paramount, is up for sale.
As for new projects, the industry's current whispered motto seems to be: Just survive till '25. Writers and producers pitching projects are being warned to keep expectations at basement level: Nobody's buying, everybody's cutting costs, caution rules, and the boom times are over. To quote Tony Soprano -- the main character in a hit show back when a golden age seemed to be dawning, not dimming -- things are trending downward. He had no idea how prescient he was.
If "Hollywood" were a big summer movie, we'd be right at the end of Act II, at the always-darkest-before-the-dawn moment in the story, when all seems lost. Or, as one agent put it to me, "A lot of us are feeling like we're working in the aftermath of an industry, not in an industry." But as any fan of Hollywood screenplays knows, this is also when the beaten-down heroes look at the redrawn battlefield, assess the new, heightened stakes, regroup and eventually triumph. The movie business, since at least the 1940s, has always defined itself by perceived threats to its survival -- charges of Communist influence, the advent of television and the rise of the VCR, cable or streaming -- and it has always found a way to rebound.
In the mid-1960s, when studio culture was besieged and foundering and nobody who ran Hollywood could understand why the old ways were no longer working, "it wasn't just that we were sick of the system," the director Arthur Penn once told me. "The system was sick of itself." But that malaise, dejection and uncertainty led to a major upheaval -- and a decade of churning creative excitement. The New Hollywood movement of the late 1960s and 1970s happened because a bunch of great young filmmakers made a bunch of great new movies ("Bonnie and Clyde" and "The Graduate" and "Easy Rider" and "The Godfather" and "Jaws") that turned out to be huge hits. But it's worth noting that the people in charge at the time considered most of those movies exceptions, oddities and anomalies. The industry didn't realize that the world beneath its feet was changing.
That's where the movie business is right now: The system, it seems, is once again sick of itself. The industry has, for the past four years, been wondering when it can get back to normal, and it's becoming increasingly clear that there may be no such thing. There is only forward to something new. The industry is about to find out what that might look like.
In the ashes of last year, an outline of this new normal started to emerge. It's a landscape that consists not of just big studios (this isn't the 1950s) or big studios competing with upstart indies that steal their awards (this isn't the 1990s) but of a mix of new and old models: studios; indies; streamers like Apple, Amazon and Netflix; and the kind of out-of-nowhere hits, faith-based movies and red-state phenomena like "Sound of Freedom" that keep taking people on the coasts by surprise.
It's also a landscape that, like so many these days, involves Taylor Swift. In 2023 "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour" bypassed traditional distributors, went straight to theaters and outgrossed all but 10 of last year's biggest movies domestically. If theaters are going to survive, this kind of communal event -- the "you have to be there with 20 friends" movie/dance party -- is probably going to be integral to their future. One acknowledgment of the Swift effect came when the streaming rights to "The Eras Tour" went to Disney for reportedly more than $ 75 million. Hollywood finally stepped up with a tried-and-true old-school principle: If you can't beat 'em, eat 'em (even if it's a very expensive meal).
If the defining piece of good news for the studios in 2023 was Barbenheimer, the industry seems unwilling to learn from its success. Barbenheimer suggested that audiences might get excited when two huge, very different films open on the same day -- but studios, which used to compete head-to-head almost every weekend, now try desperately to avoid those scheduling clashes. Astonishingly, several weekends in 2024, as of now, have not even one big new movie, let alone two, set to open. That's a mistake. Studios need to chase this kind of collision, and Barbenheimer was a useful reminder that old-world studios (Universal released "Oppenheimer," and Warner Bros. released "Barbie") are among the few entities with the sheer marketing muscle to stoke a bona fide worldwide event.
The year 2023 provided two blockbusters that are going head-to-head for best picture, a Hollywood studio dream come true. But that can't erase the fact that superhero movies, the industry's cash cow for the past dozen years, showed ominous signs of collapse. All four of Warner's DC movies underperformed, including "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom," "Shazam! Fury of the Gods," "The Flash" and "Blue Beetle." Disney's "The Marvels" -- a sequel to "Captain Marvel," which grossed $ 427 million -- earned a woeful $ 85 million. It seems unkind even to mention Sony's disastrous attempt at building out a "Spider-Man" extended universe with "Madame Web."
Superhero movies aren't finished -- Disney and Warner Bros. have locked in multiyear, multimovie plans, and "Deadpool & Wolverine" is likely to be a hit this summer -- but what had been a bulletproof business plan is in tatters. The days when audiences would faithfully trot out for every interconnected chapter of a cinematic-universe saga are over. That's no longer entertainment. That's homework.
If there's a silver lining, perhaps it can be found in an earlier superhero film, one that premiered amid great doubts about the industry 35 years ago. In the summer of 1989, prestige Hollywood moviemaking was in a rut, and anxious executives fretted that maybe young people just wanted to stay home and watch MTV, much in the way they now worry that youth are addicted to bite-size TikToks. But in 1989, the success of the director Tim Burton's "Batman" and the unexpected breakout hits "The Little Mermaid," "Sex, Lies and Videotape" and "Do the Right Thing" opened up new vistas of possibility. Three genres that had been written off as marginal -- comic book movies, animation and indies -- became gold mines. Hollywood may not yet know what's going to replace superhero films as the next reliable blockbuster category, but this current crisis at least provides an incentive to start chasing a reset.
A reset, however, requires creative energy and imagination, and that's a part of the movie industry that legacy studios have spent much of the modern era trying to eliminate. Studios have moved into an age of brand stewardship and out of the business of generating ideas and developing scripts. They've redefined their business as curation rather than discovery. That has to change, too. This isn't a high-minded plea for the industry to become something it's never been; instead, it's a pitch for the studios (and now streamers) to reconnect with the enterprising, flexible, relatively quick-to-pivot business model under which they operated successfully for a vast majority of their existence.
Hollywood has a long history of toggling between spurts of irrational exuberance and deep valleys of clinical depression. Before the perils of streaming and A.I., the existential threat in the aughts came from peak TV, that siren luring away A-list talent and audience eyeballs. But not everything that looks like an industry killer turns out to be one. The e-book did not end books or bookstores. And streaming, a business that, for all its flaws, gives more people more access to more films, will not kill movies or moviegoing. It's possible that the bungled decisions that led to two prolonged strikes -- the most vigorous recent attempt by studio heads to shoot themselves in the foot -- created one unanticipated benefit, a green shoot of improbable hope: a serious delay in the completion of giant franchise movies. Given their recent disappointing box office numbers, a few of those decades-old franchises, like "The Fast and the Furious" and "Mission: Impossible," may have finally reached retirement age.
In light of this blockbuster shortage -- and out of sheer panicked supply chain necessity -- Hollywood is looking at and buying and even making plans to produce a bunch of scripts that can get off the ground fast and be cast, shot and edited reasonably quickly. They're the kinds of films that don't require a $ 250 million budget and a year of complicated postproduction work. They're films like "Hamnet," directed by the Oscar winner Chloé Zhao (whose last film was an underperforming Marvel movie, "Eternals"), and "Novocaine," a thriller acquired by Paramount starring Jack Quaid. Even Tom Cruise, who hasn't starred in a nonfranchise movie since 2017, is teaming with the Oscar-winning director Alejandro Iñárritu. These are self-contained films that don't demand moviegoers have a Ph.D. in previous installments or extended universes.
They're the kinds of films you might sometimes wish Hollywood made more of. Maybe you remember them. They're what used to be called movies.

Full text: This stirring film from Noora Niasari follows an Iranian woman and her daughter living in a women's shelter in Australia.
In Noora Niasari's deeply felt drama "Shayda," an Iranian mother finds sanctuary in culture and community while seeking liberation from an abusive marriage. The film unfolds during Nowruz, a regenerative Persian holiday set on the spring equinox. But in Australia, where Shayda (Zar Amir Ebrahimi) and her young daughter Mona (Selina Zahednia) are temporarily residing in a women's shelter, Nowruz falls in autumn. Like a deciduous tree, Shayda can only access renewal by shedding the life she once knew.
In her first narrative feature, Niasari, who based the story in part on her own experiences, demonstrates an astounding control of pacing and mood. Where other films about abuse insist on stakes through violence, "Shayda" conveys isolation or danger in small visual cues: images in silhouette, wordless long takes, strategically-placed jump cuts. And while the film shows that Shayda's ex, Hossein (Osamah Sami), poses a visceral threat, Niasari locates the heart of the film in the reinforced connections -- to heritage and other women in the shelter -- that enable the duo's survival.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Throughout, our protagonist faces pressure to return to Hossein, both from pervasive scorn in the Iranian diaspora community and from the many legal impediments to her independence. As Shayda weathers these storms, the film surrounding her evolves into an understated chronicle of female conviction. When all else fails, Shayda turns to Persian music and dance, where, side by side with Mona, she takes refuge from doubt in exuberant movement.
Shayda
Rated PG-13 for stories of domestic abuse. Running time: 1 hour 57 minutes.

Humanoid Robot Maker
Teams Up With OpenAI
OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is looking to fuse its artificial intelligence systems into humanoid robots as part of a new deal with a robotics start-up, Figure.
Figure, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., announced the partnership on Thursday along with $ 675 million in venture capital funding from a group that includes the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as well as Microsoft, the chipmaker Nvidia and the start-up-funding divisions of Intel and OpenAI.
Figure is less than two years old and doesn't have a commercial product but is persuading influential tech industry backers to support its vision of shipping billions of humanlike robots to the world's workplaces and homes.
OpenAI will build specialized A.I. models for Figure's humanoid robots, likely based on OpenAI's existing technology such as GPT language models, the image-generator DALL-E and the new video-generator Sora.

Anheuser-Busch InBev
Recovers From Backlash
Anheuser-Busch InBev, the maker of Budweiser, Bud Light, Stella Artois and Corona, reported better-than-expected net income in the fourth quarter despite lower beer volumes.
The beverage company said Thursday that its fourth-quarter operating earnings rose 7 percent to $ 19.98 billion, or 82 cents per share, more than the 76-cent profit analysts expected, according to FactSet.
Revenue in the United States declined 17.3 percent in the fourth quarter and 9.5 percent for the year. Bud Light, the company's best-selling U.S. brand, faced a conservative backlash last year after it sent a commemorative can to the transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney. Transgender rights supporters also deserted the brand, saying it didn't do enough to support Ms. Mulvaney.

LAYOFFS
Electronic Arts Cuts 5%
Of Work Force in Pullback
Electronic Arts is cutting about 5 percent of its work force, or approximately 670 employees, as layoffs in the technology and gaming sector continue after a surge of hiring in recent years.
The video game maker said in a regulatory filing that its board approved a restructuring plan that includes the layoffs, as well as closing some offices or facilities.
The Redwood City, Calif., company had 13,400 workers globally as of March, 31, 2023, according to a filing.
Electronic Arts estimates incurring about $ 125 million to $ 165 million in total charges related to the restructuring. The company anticipates approximately $ 50 million to $ 65 million in charges associated with office space reductions and about $ 40 million to $ 55 million related to severance and employee-related costs.
The announcement comes just days after Sony said that it would cut about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Disney Strikes Mega-Deal In India: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries will control what is left of Disney's grasp at India's burgeoning media market.
The Walt Disney Company announced on Wednesday a joint venture with India's biggest conglomerate, Reliance Industries, in an $ 8.5 billion deal that will create a media powerhouse in the world's most populous nation and end Disney's decades-long solo effort to gain a foothold in the market.
Reliance Industries, which is owned by Mukesh Ambani, India's richest person, will be Disney's senior partner in the deal. With $ 239 billion in market capitalization and rights to the wildly popular Indian Premier League cricket matches, Reliance is a juggernaut in the media landscape in India.
Disney and Reliance already had a combined market share of about 40 to 45 percent in advertising and about the same fraction of streaming, giving them a big edge over competitors, said Karan Taurani, a research analyst at Elara Capital.
"This will lead to better profitability because the content costs could come down" in both TV and streaming, Mr. Taurani said.
As part of the deal, Disney will merge its Indian operations with those of Viacom18, a part of Reliance Industries. Reliance and Viacom18 will hold 63 percent of the new venture, and Disney 37 percent, the companies said in a statement. Reliance will pay $ 1.4 billion to consolidate its control.
Nita M. Ambani, Mr. Ambani's wife, will be the chair of the joint venture; the vice chair will be Uday Shankar, the former chairman of Disney India.
"Reliance has a deep understanding of the Indian market and consumer," Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, said in a statement. "We're excited for the opportunities that this joint venture will provide to create long-term value."
Disney is one of the biggest of companies in the world, valued at $ 200 billion; in India, though, it proved no match for the homegrown hero.
Disney first came to India, now a country of 1.4 billion potential media consumers, in 1993, and found a distributor to broadcast some of its content.
Along with India's market, Disney's ambitions grew. Last year, the accounting and consulting firm EY estimated that India's media landscape would be worth $ 30 billion this year and $ 100 billion by 2030. And Disney banked on bringing hundreds of millions of subscribers to its own streaming services.
Disney's adventures in India were at their high point in 2019, when it bought 21st Century Fox from the Murdoch family's News Corp. Among Fox's assets, Disney won TV and streaming rights to the Indian Premier League cricket matches.
Big subscriber numbers followed, but at great cost. At its pandemic-fueled peak, Disney+ had 162 million subscribers in India, but it was losing almost $ 500 million worldwide in pursuit of viewers. By summer 2022, its global operations had bled more than $ 11 billion since the purchase of Fox and launch of Disney+.
That is when Disney ran into trouble. Reliance Industries snatched away the cricket rights in 2022 for nearly $ 3 billion. Disney lost 11.5 million Indian subscribers in short order, even as it gained 800,000 new ones in the rest of the world.
Still, Disney is not abandoning India.
"India remains a key market for the company and one of the strongest international growth markets of scale, and we are committed to ensuring a robust presence there," Disney executives said in an email to employees on Wednesday.
When Reliance was started by Mr. Ambani's father in 1958, it was a trading shop, mainly of polyester fiber. It grew into petrochemicals and now runs the world's largest oil refinery at the port in Jamnagar, on a remote bit of India's western coastline. Along the way, it got into telecommunications and other businesses, and in 2016 started a low-cost mobile network, Jio, which quickly became the world's third largest.
JioCinema, part of a growing family of Jio properties but a relatively small platform when India's streaming wars began, looks likely to become the new home for Disney's content in India. At one point another rival looked ready to emerge, as the Japanese media giant Sony was seeking to expand its operations in India by buying Zee Entertainment.
With Zee, India's first private cable-TV company, Sony would have been big enough to divide up the TV-and-digital market with Reliance and Disney. But Sony backed out of its deal with Zee on Jan. 22, frustrated by the founding family's insistence on maintaining control.
Sony's breakup with Zee seems to have made things even harder for Disney. For one thing, Zee still owes Disney for cricket licensing. Bloomberg reported that the estimated value of Disney's India unit sank to $ 4.5 billion from $ 10 billion. Sony's failed merger also made the eventual Disney deal look sweeter for Mr. Ambani: What would have been a landscape defined by two giants is instead looking likely to be dominated by just one.
Being such a sprawling conglomerate, Reliance has an advantage in the battles for media domination. It does not need content to pay for itself directly. When their subscribers are brought into their retail, telecom and credit operations, the cost of making shows looks small by comparison to combined revenue.

Lowe's Reports Sales Slower Than Expected
Lowe's on Tuesday joined larger rival Home Depot in signaling a slower recovery in the home-improvement market as consumers remain tightfisted against the backdrop of sticky inflation and uncertainty over the economy's prospects.
Investors were betting on a more normalized U.S. home improvement environment this year after 2023 was called a transition period as the industry digested the outsize gains from the pandemic.
Persistent inflation and a stagnant housing market were forcing consumers to hold out on big-ticket purchases, Marvin Ellison, the chief executive, said on a post-earnings call.
"Unfortunately, it's still very difficult to predict" when home improvement demand will inflect, Mr. Ellison said.
The company is particularly squeezed as do-it-yourself customers, who generate 75 percent of its total sales, are allocating fewer dollars to large-scale home remodeling and cutting back on discretionary items as they take up only necessary repair work.
Lowe's forecast sales to be down 2 percent to 3 percent in fiscal 2024, while analysts were expecting a 1.13 percent drop.
"We expect comp sales to improve (in the second half) ... To be clear, we are not forecasting an improvement in demand trends this year. Rather, the compares are easier in the second half," the chief financial officer, Brandon Sink, said.
The company is banking on its new DIY loyalty program, expected to roll out nationwide in March, to help draw demand from more value-sensitive customers.
The No. 2 U.S. home-improvement chain projected annual per-share earnings between $ 12.00 and $ 12.30. Reuters
LABOR
Sony to Slash 900 Jobs
In PlayStation Division
Sony will cut about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division, or about 8 percent of its global work force, becoming the latest company in the technology and gaming sector to announce layoffs.
Sony cited changes in the industry as a reason for the restructuring.
"The industry has changed immensely, and we need to future ready ourselves to set the business up for what lies ahead," Sony Interactive Entertainment's chief executive Jim Ryan said in a blog post on Tuesday. "We need to deliver on expectations from developers and gamers and continue to propel future technology in gaming, so we took a step back to ensure we are set up to continue bringing the best gaming experiences to the community."
The layoffs on Tuesday arrive one month after Microsoft said it would cut nearly 2,000 workers after its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. And Riot Games, the developer of the popular "League of Legends" multiplayer battle game, said in January that it was laying off 11 percent of its staff.
The job cuts will occur in the Americas, Japan, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region.
In London, the PlayStation Studio will shut. Cuts will also be made at Firesprite studio and across Sony Interactive Entertainment in the U.K., the company said. Associated Press

Full text: "The Notebook" and "Cabaret" land on Broadway. Olivia Rodrigo's tour stops in Manhattan. Plus: Herbie Hancock, Heartbeat Opera and Trisha Brown Dance Company.
Broadway
THE NOTEBOOK Nicholas Sparks's 1996 novel (adapted for the screen in 2004) is now a sweeping musical tale of romantic idealism and the decades-long love between Allie and Noah. The Chicago Tribune gave a glowing review to the 2022 Chicago Shakespeare Theater premiere, and several performers from the Chicago cast, including Maryann Plunkett as Older Allie, will reprise their roles. The show features a book by Bekah Brunstetter ("This Is Us") and music and lyrics by Ingrid Michaelson, with Michael Greif and Schele Williams directing. Now playing at the Schoenfeld Theater, Manhattan.
THE WHO'S TOMMY The show, with music and lyrics by Pete Townshend who wrote the book with Des McAnuff, was on Broadway 30 years ago, but this new take, which had its premiere at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, is very heavy on visual spectacle (and, egad, how theatrical effects have changed in three decades!). Tommy is a traumatized child who witnesses violence and loses his ability to see, hear and speak. He plays mean pinball, though, and in the strange spectacle becomes something of a messiah. The leads, including Ali Louis Bourzgui (Tommy), Alison Luff (Mrs. Walker) and Adam Jacobs (Captain Walker), are revisiting the roles they played at the Goodman. Choreography is by Lorin Latarro ("Waitress"), and McAnuff directs. Performances begin March 8 at the Nederlander Theater, Manhattan.
LEMPICKA The life of the Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka was not a screamingly obvious topic for a Broadway musical, but an impressive team has collaborated on this show. The Polish-born Lempicka (1898-1980), who was married, twice, to men, but had female lovers as well, lived through two world wars, surrounded by cultural and political change in Russia, Paris and California. Rachel Chavkin directs a cast led by Eden Espinosa as Lempicka, who returns to the role that wowed critics in productions at the Williamstown Theater Festival and La Jolla Playhouse. The show features music by Matt Gould and lyrics by Carson Kreitzer; they collaborated on the book. Performances begin March 19 at the Longacre Theater, Manhattan.
SUFFS The hard-fought passage of the 19th amendment, which codified women's right to vote in 1919, is the focus of this musical by Shaina Taub. In addition to the challenge of being book writer, lyricist and composer, Taub also stars as Alice Paul (1885-1977), a leader of the National Woman's Party. She and a group of like-minded women, including Ida B. Wells (Nikki M. James) and Carrie Chapman Catt (Jenn Colella), battle the patriarchy and, at times, one another. Directed by Leigh Silverman. Performances begin March 26 at the Music Box Theater, Manhattan.
HELL'S KITCHEN Alicia Keys makes her Broadway debut with this semi-autobiographical jukebox musical about a 17-year-old girl named Ali, raised in a small Manhattan apartment by her protective single mother alongside a community of artists. The show features music and lyrics by Keys, a mix of hits, including "Fallin"' and "Empire State of Mind," and new songs. The show's premiere last year at the Public Theater received decent, if not exceptional, reviews, but c'mon, this girl is on fire. The book is by Kristoffer Diaz and choreography by Camille A. Brown. Maleah Joi Moon, Shoshana Bean and Brandon Victor Dixon will reprise their roles. The busy Michael Greif (see also "The Notebook") directs. Performances begin March 28 at the Shubert Theater, Manhattan.
THE GREAT GATSBY Though the reviews from the Paper Mill Playhouse premiere this fall were not stellar, this new musical based on the 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is Broadway bound. Marc Bruni ("Beautiful: The Carole King Musical") directs the story of the nouveau riche Jay Gatsby (Jeremy Jordan, "Newsies") who schemes to win over the moneyed -- and married -- love of his life, Daisy Buchanan (Eva Noblezada, "Hadestown"). Book by Kait Kerrigan ("The Mad Ones"); songs by Nathan Tysen and Jason Howland ("Paradise Square"). Performances begin March 29 at the Broadway Theater, Manhattan.
CABARET Eddie Redmayne recreates his Olivier Award-winning turn as the Emcee in this innovative revival of the 1966 Kander and Ebb musical, which was a hot -- and expensive -- ticket in London when it premiered in 2021. The immersive design by Tom Scutt will transform the whole theater, even its lobby, into the Kit Kat Club of Weimar Berlin. (V.I.P. tickets include preshow drinks and dinner.) The cast includes Gayle Rankin, Ato Blankson-Wood, Bebe Neuwirth and Steven Skybell. Direction by Rebecca Frecknall. Performances begin April 1 at the August Wilson Theater, Manhattan.
PATRIOTS Vladimir V. Putin was a humble deputy mayor of St. Petersburg before the Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky jump-started his rise to power. This new play by Peter Morgan ("The Crown"), which had a well-received run in London, tracks their terrifying alliance and eventual falling out, including Berezovsky's political exile. Michael Stuhlbarg, back on Broadway for the first time since 2005, will star as Berezovsky, with the English actor Will Keen reprising his Olivier Award-winning role as Putin. Rupert Goold directs. Performances begin April 1 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, Manhattan. (S.M.)
UNCLE VANYA For the Chekhov-obsessed, nothing excites like a really good cast in one of his classics, and here it is Steve Carell playing the lovesick title character, toiling away at the family farm with his niece Sonya (Alison Pill). Their lonely lives are disrupted by the arrival of Sonya's famous father (Alfred Molina) with his new wife (Anika Noni Rose). The cast also includes William Jackson Harper ("The Good Place") and Jayne Houdyshell ("The Humans"), with Lila Neugebauer ("Appropriate") directing. This Lincoln Center Theater production features a new translation by Heidi Schreck ("What the Constitution Means to Me"), who worked for a time as a teacher and journalist in St. Petersburg. Performances begin April 2 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Manhattan.
MOTHER PLAY A mother with strong ideas about her children's futures supervises her two teenage kids as they prepare to move to a new apartment in this latest from the Pulitzer Prize winner Paula Vogel ("How I Learned to Drive"). What might they unpack? Set near Washington, D.C., in 1962, the play digs into the complexities and power of family bonds. Tina Landau directs a starry cast -- Jessica Lange, Celia Keenan-Bolger ("To Kill a Mockingbird") and Jim Parsons ("The Boys in the Band") -- in this premiere from Second Stage Theater. Performances begin April 2 at the Hayes Theater, Manhattan. (STEVEN McELROY )
Off Broadway
CORRUPTION In this new play, J.T. Rogers writes about the phone-hacking scandal in Britain that threatened to bring down the media mogul Rupert Murdoch more than a decade ago. Based on the book coauthored by Tom Watson, a member of Parliament who fought back against the unsavory tactics of Murdoch's newspapers, the show features a large cast, including Dylan Baker, K. Todd Freeman, Sepideh Moafi and Seth Numrich. Directed by Bartlett Sher, who also directed Rogers's "Oslo" and "Blood and Gifts." Through April 14 at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Manhattan.
THE ALLY and DEAD OUTLAW Itamar Moses ("The Band's Visit") has a busy spring coming up. His latest, "The Ally," has its world premiere at the Public Theater in a production directed by Lila Neugebauer (also busy; see "Uncle Vanya"). It stars Josh Radnor as a Jewish college professor whose identities as a progressive and an artist are challenged when a student asks him to sign a social justice manifesto. Through March 17 at the Public Theater, Manhattan. Nearby at the Minetta Lane Theater, Audible is mounting "Dead Outlaw," a crazy-sounding tale -- based on a true story -- of a dead Western robber whose mummified remains traveled all over the country as a sideshow attraction for decades. The book is by Moses and the songs by David Yazbek (also "The Band's Visit") and Erik Della Penna. David Cromer directs. Feb. 28-April 7, Minetta Lane Theater, Manhattan.
ILLINOISE This dance-theater hybrid, based on Sufjan Stevens's 2005 concept album "Illinois," comes to the Park Avenue Armory after a well-received run at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Justin Peck is the director and choreographer. With the playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury ("Fairview"), Peck also wrote the narrative adapted from the album's tales of people, places and events in Illinois, following a central character named Henry. March 2-23 at the Park Avenue Armory, Manhattan.
LIKE THEY DO IN THE MOVIES Not a lot of information is available about this world premiere solo show written by and starring Laurence Fishburne. He has described it as "the stories and lies people have told me. And that I have told myself." Given Fishburne's magnetism onscreen and in stage roles, from Morpheus in "The Matrix" series to his Tony Award-winning turn in August Wilson's "Two Trains Running," it's a solid bet he'll be well worth our time even based only on that flimsy description. March 10-31 at the Perelman Performing Arts Center, Manhattan.
STAFF MEAL While the world falls apart, a group of lonely city dwellers take refuge inside a restaurant in this new play by Abe Koogler, who has written effectively about people who work at difficult jobs in both "Kill Floor" and "Fulfillment Center." Morgan Green, a co-artistic director of the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia, directs. April 12-May 19 at Playwrights Horizons, Manhattan.
TEETH The Playwrights Horizons season also includes this irreverent and intriguing musical adaptation of the 2007 cult classic film about a young woman with toothed genitalia. The book is by Michael R. Jackson ("A Strange Loop") and Anna K. Jacobs, with music by Jacobs and lyrics by Jackson. Sarah Benson ("Blasted") directs. Through March 31 at Playwrights Horizons, Manhattan.
SALLY & TOM Suzan-Lori Parks's new play explores the relationship between the enslaved woman Sally Hemings and her enslaver, Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, by staging a play within it. When a contemporary playwright and a director (also an interracial couple) star in this fictional show, the experience naturally impacts their own relationship. This New York premiere arrives after a 2022 debut at Minnesota's Guthrie Theater. Steve H. Broadnax III directs. March 28-April 28 at the Public Theater, Manhattan.
GRENFELL: IN THE WORDS OF SURVIVORS This is a story about a terrible fire in a London high-rise that killed dozens of people in 2017, partly because of faulty construction. The text is by Gillian Slovo, who assembled transcripts of interviews with survivors and the bereaved, and the play's premiere at the National Theater in London last year and captivated audiences and critics. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd and Anthony Simpson-Pike, the show was not without controversy as some survivors found revisiting the event to be inappropriate. April 13-May 12 at St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn.
HERE THERE ARE BLUEBERRIES In late 2006, a former U.S. Army intelligence officer sent a letter to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, saying he had a collection of photographs from Auschwitz in the 1940s. The photos offer the cruel and chilling juxtaposition of Nazi officers and employees at leisure -- and a group of young women who worked in communications happily eating blueberries -- nearby the death camp. Conceived and directed by Moisés Kaufman, a founder of Tectonic Theater Project, and co-written with Amanda Gronich, the show comes to New York following well-received productions at La Jolla Playhouse and the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C. April 17-June 2 at New York Theater Workshop, Manhattan.
THE LONELY FEW Two lesbian rockers take a stab at love in the face of intolerance after meeting in small town Kentucky in this musical, featuring a book by Rachel Bonds ("Jonah") and music and lyrics by Zoe Sarnak. After several years of development, the show had its premiere at the Geffen Playhouse last year. Trip Cullman ("Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow") and Ellenore Scott co-direct a cast that includes Lauren Patten, Taylor Iman Jones and Thomas Silcott. April 27-June 2 at MCC Theater, Manhattan.
THREE HOUSES Despite the scant details available, this new musical by Dave Malloy ("Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812") is likely to be a spring highlight. Malloy writes about the link among three strangers -- Susan in Latvia, Sadie in New Mexico and Beckett in Ireland, all haunted by grandparents -- in an exploration of the post-pandemic world. Annie Tippe directs. April 30-June 9, Pershing Square Signature Center, Manhattan. (STEVEN McELROY )
Dance
BETH GILL: 'NAIL BITER' Beth Gill, an exacting choreographer, has a spare, seductive way of revealing a stage and the dancers who inhabit it. In her highly controlled settings, space folds into time just as time folds into space. It's slow, uncanny and gripping; even the title of her latest work, "Nail Biter," is a nod to her skill at building tension. Making its long-awaited New York City premiere at N.Y.U. Skirball, "Nail Biter" explores the unease of the present moment. Transformed by Baille Younkman's arresting costumes and accessories -- a tight trench, high white boots, wigs -- the dancers come together as something of a portrait of our collective unconscious. Framed by Jon Moniaci's eerie score, "Nail Biter" has a supernatural feel, but it's not just about sensation. Gill's composition is to die for, too: It's always there to hold her vision together. April 12-13, N.Y.U. Skirball, Manhattan. (GIA KOURLAS)
DANCING THE 92nd Street Y: A 150th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION Few institutions have had a greater impact on modern dance than the 92nd Street Y, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary. Agnes de Mille once called it "the veritable cradle of the modern-dance movement," and it was instrumental in the development of Martha Graham, José Limón, Paul Taylor and many others. Where was Alvin Ailey's "Revelations" first performed? At the Y. This spring, that history will be on display in an exhibition, "Dance to Belong," and several events. For an anniversary program on March 12, the companies of Graham and Limón, along with Ailey II, will perform classics by their namesake choreographers, paired with new pieces by contemporary artists like Jamar Roberts. Better yet, on May 13, the Taylor company will recreate the "7 New Dances" program that Taylor debuted at the Y in 1957, an evening famous for its avant-garde experiments and the puzzled or hostile reviews it received, including one that was four inches of blank space. March 12 and May 13 at the 92nd Street Y, Manhattan. (BRIAN SEIBERT)
MAX ROACH 100 The music of the jazz drummer, composer and civil-rights activist Max Roach, who was born 100 years ago (and died in 2007), is rich material for dancers and choreographers, replete with rhythms that goad and challenge, spiked with messages to supply meaning. A centenary program of newly commissioned pieces at the Joyce Theater boasts a lineup worthy of the jazz legend. The hip-hop master Rennie Harris leans into the message side, choosing a track of Roach drum-talking along to Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. Ronald K. Brown, in a work combining his company with dancers from the Cuban troupe Malpaso, stays in his comfort zone, riding the Afro-Cuban grooves of "Percussion Bitter Sweet." The tap dancer Ayodele Casel takes the prize for courage, launching herself into the maelstrom of duets between Roach and the way-out-there pianist Cecil Taylor. April 2-7 at the Joyce Theater, Manhattan. (B.S.)
BEHIND THE GROOVE The Guggenheim Museum hosts a special edition of this long-running dance party, organized by the break dancing pioneers and custodians of hip-hop culture Kwikstep (Gabriel Dionisio) and Rokafella (Ana Garcia). Behind the Groove first emerged in 2009, when street and club dancers found themselves increasingly unwelcome at New York City bars and clubs. Rokafella, in an interview, described it as "our response to this bottle-service lounge nightlife that was replacing the dance club heyday of New York City," a place for "just jamming." Over the years, the party has found a home at freestyle-friendly locations like Le Poisson Rouge, the Nuyorican Poets Café and, most recently, Bogart House. Its incarnation at the Guggenheim, presented by Works & Process, brings together dancers and DJs for a night of breaking, house, hustle, popping, locking and other styles. Come to dance or just to watch. March 18 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Manhattan. (SIOBHAN BURKE)
TRISHA BROWN DANCE COMPANY During Brown's lifetime, her company was a laboratory for her wild movement invention; after her death in 2017, it became devoted to preserving her legacy. But it's hard to sustain a company through preservation alone. In the past two years, the troupe has entered a promising new chapter of inviting outside choreographers in, commissioning new dances that converse with its founder's. The latest is by the French contemporary choreographer Noé Soulier -- a nod to Brown's connections with France, where she developed an ardent following. Soulier's "In the Fall" shares a program at the Joyce Theater with two Brown gems: "Working Title" (1985), an exploration of speed and taking flight; and "Glacial Decoy" (1979), her first work for the proscenium stage and a stealthy response to that traditional frame, with designs by Robert Rauschenberg. Traces of the old will surely find their way into the new. March 26-31 at the Joyce Theater, Manhattan. (S.B.)
Classical
'EUROPERAS 3 & 4' No two performances will be the same with this John Cage double bill, a collage taken from the European opera canon and determined by chance -- not only the music, but also the costumes and the lighting design. Cage's idea was to take a European tradition (Euro operas, get it?) and send it back (your operas, get it?) from an American composer (himself) with playful chaos. In 2018, Yuval Sharon grandly staged "Europeras 1 & 2" at Sony's film studios in Los Angeles, with the idea that Hollywood is an American analogue for European opera house. Now, as the artistic leader of the freshly innovative Detroit Opera, he will follow up that production with Cage's comparatively intimate sequels. For some star power, the great mezzo-soprano Susan Graham and the mighty bass-baritone Davóne Tines have been cast in "Europera 4." March 8-10 at the Gem Theater, Detroit. (JOSHUA BARONE)
DANISH STRING QUARTET So far, the artistic projects of this group have been all about juxtaposition. The Prism series drew a line from Bach fugues to late Beethoven quartets and their 20th-century successors -- all communicated with the Danish players' thoroughly considered, yet never mannered, interpretation, and a lithe, anti-Golden Age sound that can break your heart with its spareness. Even more satisfying has been the four-part Doppelgänger, which pairs late Schubert with world premieres. It reaches its conclusion with Schubert's String Quintet in C, some of the most moving and sublime music ever written, followed by a new string quintet by Thomas Adès, one of the few living composers whose works can hold their own against the standard repertoire. But that's not all. Because of pandemic delays, there will still be more Doppelgänger to come: Part One belatedly arrives at Carnegie Hall next year. April 18 at Zankel Hall, Manhattan. (J.B.)
'AN AMERICAN SOLDIER' It's a small miracle whenever a contemporary opera gets a revival, much less a second production. But this work, by Huang Ruo, with a libretto by David Henry Hwang, is about to get its third, at the Perelman Performing Arts Center. The earliest form of the opera -- the tragic true story of Pvt. Danny Chen, who grew up in Manhattan's Chinatown and enlisted in the Army, then was found dead at his base in Afghanistan -- premiered in Washington as a one-act in 2014. I saw an expanded, two-act version at Opera Theater of St. Louis in 2018. Even in rehearsal, I was immediately struck by its smartly controlled stylistic eclecticism, its underlying tension of anxiety and aspiration, and its libretto's ability to remain propulsive while jumping back and forth between a courtroom drama and flashbacks. This latest staging will be directed by Chay Yew, of "Cambodian Rock Band" and "Sweatshop Overlord." May 12-19 at the Perelman Performing Arts Center, Manhattan. (J.B.)
HEARTBEAT OPERA'S 'EUGENE ONEGIN' Among the most successful of the so-called indie opera companies to emerge over the past 20 or so years, Heartbeat Opera has carved out a niche with trimmed-down modernizations of canonical works. But beyond the ripped-from-the-headlines concepts -- a "Fidelio" for the Black Lives Matter generation, a "Der Freischütz" about gun culture and toxic masculinity -- stands the wizard of the operation: the music director and arranger Dan Schlosberg, whose imaginative chamber orchestrations have the capacity to reinvent opera's most beloved scores. Yes, Heartbeat's new "Eugene Onegin" has a timely topic, exploring Tchaikovsky's sexuality against a contemporary backdrop of the Russian government's hostility toward queer visibility. If you're like me, though, you will also want to hear what kind of ingenuity Schlosberg applies to the score, with nine musicians playing 15 instruments, including clarinet, French horn, harp, balalaika and some strings. April 2-13, Baruch Performing Arts Center, Manhattan. (OUSSAMA ZAHR)
'SHIFTING GROUND' The violinist Alexi Kenney wowed audiences in 2020 with a recital at the 92nd Street Y that paired the music of Bach with works by modern-day composers. Now he's back -- this time, with a new program, a slate of commissions for solo violin and a new collaborator: the visual artist Xuan, a classically trained pianist who uses animation, abstract scenery and videos to bring music to life. The 60-minute concert is presented as five chapters, each pairing Bach's works with modern pieces. The Allemande from Bach's Second Partita, for example, is performed alongside works by Rafiq Bhatia and Paul Wiancko. Other featured composers include Salina Fisher, Angélica Negrón and Kaija Saariaho. It's all a nod to the concept of the ground bass -- a recurring melodic pattern that underpins many compositions, from Bach's era to the present. April 25-27 at the Jerome Robbins Theater, Baryshnikov Arts Center, Manhattan. (JAVIER C. HERNÁNDEZ)
Pop and Jazz
HERBIE HANCOCK Acoustic or electric, in jazz or funk or electronic music, Herbie Hancock, 83, has been a titan of innovation and brainy exuberance. As pianist and composer on his own recordings, and with the Miles Davis Quintet in the 1960s, he stretched the harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary of jazz while staying grounded in the blues. Soon after synthesizers arrived, he mastered them and came up with indelible funk tunes. In concert -- solo, as a bandleader or in duets with peers like Chick Corea and Wayne Shorter -- he is constantly probing and heading out on a limb. But in recent decades he has released very few recordings. That makes his concert this spring at Lincoln Center -- leading a full band and revisiting compositions from across his career -- all the more essential. March 26, David Geffen Hall, Manhattan. (JON PARELES)
ZACH BRYAN In the last two years, Zach Bryan has released two studio albums (one of which was 34 songs long), two EPs and a live album, a prodigious level of output. Perhaps the live album tells Bryan's story best -- his concerts are raucous blood-lettings, onstage and in the crowd. His Springsteen-esque blue-collar rock makes for a rollicking show, and an emotionally expressive one. And even though he now has a No. 1 album ("Zach Bryan," released last year) and a No. 1 single ("I Remember Everything," a duet with Kacey Musgraves, which recently netted his first Grammy), Bryan's comfort zone remains onstage, on the road, with an ocean of voices shouting right back at him. March 14 and 15 at Prudential Center, Newark; March 27 and 28 at Barclays Center, Brooklyn; March 30 and 31 at UBS Arena, Elmont, N.Y. (JON CARAMANICA)
THE MAGNETIC FIELDS In 1999, the indie band the Magnetic Fields released "69 Love Songs," an ambitious but cheeky opus that considered the love song from every possible angle, and interpreted in nearly every musical genre imaginable. Even at its most irreverent -- "Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits," say -- the tracks were cleverly structured, melodically memorable and sharply penned by the group's principal songwriter, Stephin Merritt. To celebrate the triple-album's 25th anniversary, the band will perform "69 Love Songs" in its entirety over the course of two nights. The set list is guaranteed to be an eclectic embarrassment of riches, featuring the twinkling "Busby Berkeley Dreams," the effervescent "Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side" and the earnestly romantic "Book of Love" -- along with 66 others. April 3-10 at Town Hall, Manhattan. (LINDSAY ZOLADZ)
OLIVIA RODRIGO The pop dynamo Olivia Rodrigo's second album, "Guts," is full of spunky sonic allusions to mid-90s rock -- an era the 21-year-old singer-songwriter was not around to experience firsthand. Her four dates at Madison Square Garden -- the largest venue she's headlined yet in New York -- will serve as a kind of passing of the torch, since the eternally cool alternative legends the Breeders will be opening. Rodrigo's pair of 2022 performances at Radio City Music Hall showcased an exhilarating stage presence and a balladeer's ample vocal talent, but "Guts" highlights like "Bad Idea, Right?" and "Get Him Back!" provide even more opportunities for Rodrigo -- and the audience -- to rock out. April 5, 6, 8 and 9 at Madison Square Garden, Manhattan. (L.Z.)
PINKPANTHERESS She's a 2020s-style success story: A self-invented, self-guided English songwriter, producer and singer, PinkPantheress started out building songs on samples, went viral on TikTok and quickly conquered mainstream pop. Her megahit "Boy's a Liar Pt. 2," featuring the rapper Ice Spice, has been streamed hundreds of millions of times. With a piping soprano voice that Ice Spice has compared to a "mystical fairy," PinkPantheress sings about the ups and downs of romance and identity in the digital era; she's simultaneously self-conscious and breezily tuneful. Brooklyn Paramount, April 14-15. (J.P.)
TYLER CHILDERS Last year, the traditional country music reformist Tyler Childers released "In Your Love," a vivid ache about stumbling upon a love too good to leave behind. But it was the song's video, which told the story through a relationship between two men, that elevated Childers -- a nimble musician and stoic singer from Kentucky -- into a folk hero, particularly in the moment just after the singer Jason Aldean yanked the discourse about mainstream country hard to the right. But Childers has been waging not-so-quiet war on various establishments for some time now -- keeping myriad generations-old musical traditions vibrant, calling into question the meaning of "Americana" and singing about racism in a genre that ordinarily looks the other way. And yet a funny thing has happened: The more he speaks his truth, the bigger the stages become. May 29 and 30 at Madison Square Garden, Manhattan. (J.C.)

Full text: "The Notebook" and "Cabaret" land on Broadway. Olivia Rodrigo's tour stops in Manhattan. Plus: Herbie Hancock, Heartbeat Opera and Trisha Brown Dance Company.
Broadway
THE NOTEBOOK Nicholas Sparks's 1996 novel (adapted for the screen in 2004) is now a sweeping musical tale of romantic idealism and the decades-long love between Allie and Noah. The Chicago Tribune gave a glowing review to the 2022 Chicago Shakespeare Theater premiere, and several performers from the Chicago cast, including Maryann Plunkett as Older Allie, will reprise their roles. The show features a book by Bekah Brunstetter ("This Is Us") and music and lyrics by Ingrid Michaelson, with Michael Greif and Schele Williams directing. Now playing at the Schoenfeld Theater, Manhattan.
THE WHO'S TOMMY The show, with music and lyrics by Pete Townshend who wrote the book with Des McAnuff, was on Broadway 30 years ago, but this new take, which had its premiere at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, is very heavy on visual spectacle (and, egad, how theatrical effects have changed in three decades!). Tommy is a traumatized child who witnesses violence and loses his ability to see, hear and speak. He plays mean pinball, though, and in the strange spectacle becomes something of a messiah. The leads, including Ali Louis Bourzgui (Tommy), Alison Luff (Mrs. Walker) and Adam Jacobs (Captain Walker), are revisiting the roles they played at the Goodman. Choreography is by Lorin Latarro ("Waitress"), and McAnuff directs. Performances begin March 8 at the Nederlander Theater, Manhattan.
LEMPICKA The life of the Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka was not a screamingly obvious topic for a Broadway musical, but an impressive team has collaborated on this show. The Polish-born Lempicka (1898-1980), who was married, twice, to men, but had female lovers as well, lived through two world wars, surrounded by cultural and political change in Russia, Paris and California. Rachel Chavkin directs a cast led by Eden Espinosa as Lempicka, who returns to the role that wowed critics in productions at the Williamstown Theater Festival and La Jolla Playhouse. The show features music by Matt Gould and lyrics by Carson Kreitzer; they collaborated on the book. Performances begin March 19 at the Longacre Theater, Manhattan.
SUFFS The hard-fought passage of the 19th amendment, which codified women's right to vote in 1919, is the focus of this musical by Shaina Taub. In addition to the challenge of being book writer, lyricist and composer, Taub also stars as Alice Paul (1885-1977), a leader of the National Woman's Party. She and a group of like-minded women, including Ida B. Wells (Nikki M. James) and Carrie Chapman Catt (Jenn Colella), battle the patriarchy and, at times, one another. Directed by Leigh Silverman. Performances begin March 26 at the Music Box Theater, Manhattan.
HELL'S KITCHEN Alicia Keys makes her Broadway debut with this semi-autobiographical jukebox musical about a 17-year-old girl named Ali, raised in a small Manhattan apartment by her protective single mother alongside a community of artists. The show features music and lyrics by Keys, a mix of hits, including "Fallin"' and "Empire State of Mind," and new songs. The show's premiere last year at the Public Theater received decent, if not exceptional, reviews, but c'mon, this girl is on fire. The book is by Kristoffer Diaz and choreography by Camille A. Brown. Maleah Joi Moon, Shoshana Bean and Brandon Victor Dixon will reprise their roles. The busy Michael Greif (see also "The Notebook") directs. Performances begin March 28 at the Shubert Theater, Manhattan.
THE GREAT GATSBY Though the reviews from the Paper Mill Playhouse premiere this fall were not stellar, this new musical based on the 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is Broadway bound. Marc Bruni ("Beautiful: The Carole King Musical") directs the story of the nouveau riche Jay Gatsby (Jeremy Jordan, "Newsies") who schemes to win over the moneyed -- and married -- love of his life, Daisy Buchanan (Eva Noblezada, "Hadestown"). Book by Kait Kerrigan ("The Mad Ones"); songs by Nathan Tysen and Jason Howland ("Paradise Square"). Performances begin March 29 at the Broadway Theater, Manhattan.
CABARET Eddie Redmayne recreates his Olivier Award-winning turn as the Emcee in this innovative revival of the 1966 Kander and Ebb musical, which was a hot -- and expensive -- ticket in London when it premiered in 2021. The immersive design by Tom Scutt will transform the whole theater, even its lobby, into the Kit Kat Club of Weimar Berlin. (V.I.P. tickets include preshow drinks and dinner.) The cast includes Gayle Rankin, Ato Blankson-Wood, Bebe Neuwirth and Steven Skybell. Direction by Rebecca Frecknall. Performances begin April 1 at the August Wilson Theater, Manhattan.
PATRIOTS Vladimir V. Putin was a humble deputy mayor of St. Petersburg before the Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky jump-started his rise to power. This new play by Peter Morgan ("The Crown"), which had a well-received run in London, tracks their terrifying alliance and eventual falling out, including Berezovsky's political exile. Michael Stuhlbarg, back on Broadway for the first time since 2005, will star as Berezovsky, with the English actor Will Keen reprising his Olivier Award-winning role as Putin. Rupert Goold directs. Performances begin April 1 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, Manhattan. (S.M.)
UNCLE VANYA For the Chekhov-obsessed, nothing excites like a really good cast in one of his classics, and here it is Steve Carell playing the lovesick title character, toiling away at the family farm with his niece Sonya (Alison Pill). Their lonely lives are disrupted by the arrival of Sonya's famous father (Alfred Molina) with his new wife (Anika Noni Rose). The cast also includes William Jackson Harper ("The Good Place") and Jayne Houdyshell ("The Humans"), with Lila Neugebauer ("Appropriate") directing. This Lincoln Center Theater production features a new translation by Heidi Schreck ("What the Constitution Means to Me"), who worked for a time as a teacher and journalist in St. Petersburg. Performances begin April 2 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Manhattan.
MOTHER PLAY A mother with strong ideas about her children's futures supervises her two teenage kids as they prepare to move to a new apartment in this latest from the Pulitzer Prize winner Paula Vogel ("How I Learned to Drive"). What might they unpack? Set near Washington, D.C., in 1962, the play digs into the complexities and power of family bonds. Tina Landau directs a starry cast -- Jessica Lange, Celia Keenan-Bolger ("To Kill a Mockingbird") and Jim Parsons ("The Boys in the Band") -- in this premiere from Second Stage Theater. Performances begin April 2 at the Hayes Theater, Manhattan. (STEVEN McELROY )
Off Broadway
CORRUPTION In this new play, J.T. Rogers writes about the phone-hacking scandal in Britain that threatened to bring down the media mogul Rupert Murdoch more than a decade ago. Based on the book coauthored by Tom Watson, a member of Parliament who fought back against the unsavory tactics of Murdoch's newspapers, the show features a large cast, including Dylan Baker, K. Todd Freeman, Sepideh Moafi and Seth Numrich. Directed by Bartlett Sher, who also directed Rogers's "Oslo" and "Blood and Gifts." Through April 14 at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Manhattan.
THE ALLY and DEAD OUTLAW Itamar Moses ("The Band's Visit") has a busy spring coming up. His latest, "The Ally," has its world premiere at the Public Theater in a production directed by Lila Neugebauer (also busy; see "Uncle Vanya"). It stars Josh Radnor as a Jewish college professor whose identities as a progressive and an artist are challenged when a student asks him to sign a social justice manifesto. Through March 17 at the Public Theater, Manhattan. Nearby at the Minetta Lane Theater, Audible is mounting "Dead Outlaw," a crazy-sounding tale -- based on a true story -- of a dead Western robber whose mummified remains traveled all over the country as a sideshow attraction for decades. The book is by Moses and the songs by David Yazbek (also "The Band's Visit") and Erik Della Penna. David Cromer directs. Feb. 28-April 7, Minetta Lane Theater, Manhattan.
ILLINOISE This dance-theater hybrid, based on Sufjan Stevens's 2005 concept album "Illinois," comes to the Park Avenue Armory after a well-received run at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Justin Peck is the director and choreographer. With the playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury ("Fairview"), Peck also wrote the narrative adapted from the album's tales of people, places and events in Illinois, following a central character named Henry. March 2-23 at the Park Avenue Armory, Manhattan.
LIKE THEY DO IN THE MOVIES Not a lot of information is available about this world premiere solo show written by and starring Laurence Fishburne. He has described it as "the stories and lies people have told me. And that I have told myself." Given Fishburne's magnetism onscreen and in stage roles, from Morpheus in "The Matrix" series to his Tony Award-winning turn in August Wilson's "Two Trains Running," it's a solid bet he'll be well worth our time even based only on that flimsy description. March 10-31 at the Perelman Performing Arts Center, Manhattan.
STAFF MEAL While the world falls apart, a group of lonely city dwellers take refuge inside a restaurant in this new play by Abe Koogler, who has written effectively about people who work at difficult jobs in both "Kill Floor" and "Fulfillment Center." Morgan Green, a co-artistic director of the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia, directs. April 12-May 19 at Playwrights Horizons, Manhattan.
TEETH The Playwrights Horizons season also includes this irreverent and intriguing musical adaptation of the 2007 cult classic film about a young woman with toothed genitalia. The book is by Michael R. Jackson ("A Strange Loop") and Anna K. Jacobs, with music by Jacobs and lyrics by Jackson. Sarah Benson ("Blasted") directs. Through March 31 at Playwrights Horizons, Manhattan.
SALLY & TOM Suzan-Lori Parks's new play explores the relationship between the enslaved woman Sally Hemings and her enslaver, Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, by staging a play within it. When a contemporary playwright and a director (also an interracial couple) star in this fictional show, the experience naturally impacts their own relationship. This New York premiere arrives after a 2022 debut at Minnesota's Guthrie Theater. Steve H. Broadnax III directs. March 28-April 28 at the Public Theater, Manhattan.
GRENFELL: IN THE WORDS OF SURVIVORS This is a story about a terrible fire in a London high-rise that killed dozens of people in 2017, partly because of faulty construction. The text is by Gillian Slovo, who assembled transcripts of interviews with survivors and the bereaved, and the play's premiere at the National Theater in London last year and captivated audiences and critics. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd and Anthony Simpson-Pike, the show was not without controversy as some survivors found revisiting the event to be inappropriate. April 13-May 12 at St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn.
HERE THERE ARE BLUEBERRIES In late 2006, a former U.S. Army intelligence officer sent a letter to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, saying he had a collection of photographs from Auschwitz in the 1940s. The photos offer the cruel and chilling juxtaposition of Nazi officers and employees at leisure -- and a group of young women who worked in communications happily eating blueberries -- nearby the death camp. Conceived and directed by Moisés Kaufman, a founder of Tectonic Theater Project, and co-written with Amanda Gronich, the show comes to New York following well-received productions at La Jolla Playhouse and the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C. April 17-June 2 at New York Theater Workshop, Manhattan.
THE LONELY FEW Two lesbian rockers take a stab at love in the face of intolerance after meeting in small town Kentucky in this musical, featuring a book by Rachel Bonds ("Jonah") and music and lyrics by Zoe Sarnak. After several years of development, the show had its premiere at the Geffen Playhouse last year. Trip Cullman ("Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow") and Ellenore Scott co-direct a cast that includes Lauren Patten, Taylor Iman Jones and Thomas Silcott. April 27-June 2 at MCC Theater, Manhattan.
THREE HOUSES Despite the scant details available, this new musical by Dave Malloy ("Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812") is likely to be a spring highlight. Malloy writes about the link among three strangers -- Susan in Latvia, Sadie in New Mexico and Beckett in Ireland, all haunted by grandparents -- in an exploration of the post-pandemic world. Annie Tippe directs. April 30-June 9, Pershing Square Signature Center, Manhattan. (STEVEN McELROY )
Dance
BETH GILL: 'NAIL BITER' Beth Gill, an exacting choreographer, has a spare, seductive way of revealing a stage and the dancers who inhabit it. In her highly controlled settings, space folds into time just as time folds into space. It's slow, uncanny and gripping; even the title of her latest work, "Nail Biter," is a nod to her skill at building tension. Making its long-awaited New York City premiere at N.Y.U. Skirball, "Nail Biter" explores the unease of the present moment. Transformed by Baille Younkman's arresting costumes and accessories -- a tight trench, high white boots, wigs -- the dancers come together as something of a portrait of our collective unconscious. Framed by Jon Moniaci's eerie score, "Nail Biter" has a supernatural feel, but it's not just about sensation. Gill's composition is to die for, too: It's always there to hold her vision together. April 12-13, N.Y.U. Skirball, Manhattan. (GIA KOURLAS)
DANCING THE 92nd Street Y: A 150th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION Few institutions have had a greater impact on modern dance than the 92nd Street Y, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary. Agnes de Mille once called it "the veritable cradle of the modern-dance movement," and it was instrumental in the development of Martha Graham, José Limón, Paul Taylor and many others. Where was Alvin Ailey's "Revelations" first performed? At the Y. This spring, that history will be on display in an exhibition, "Dance to Belong," and several events. For an anniversary program on March 12, the companies of Graham and Limón, along with Ailey II, will perform classics by their namesake choreographers, paired with new pieces by contemporary artists like Jamar Roberts. Better yet, on May 13, the Taylor company will recreate the "7 New Dances" program that Taylor debuted at the Y in 1957, an evening famous for its avant-garde experiments and the puzzled or hostile reviews it received, including one that was four inches of blank space. March 12 and May 13 at the 92nd Street Y, Manhattan. (BRIAN SEIBERT)
MAX ROACH 100 The music of the jazz drummer, composer and civil-rights activist Max Roach, who was born 100 years ago (and died in 2007), is rich material for dancers and choreographers, replete with rhythms that goad and challenge, spiked with messages to supply meaning. A centenary program of newly commissioned pieces at the Joyce Theater boasts a lineup worthy of the jazz legend. The hip-hop master Rennie Harris leans into the message side, choosing a track of Roach drum-talking along to Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. Ronald K. Brown, in a work combining his company with dancers from the Cuban troupe Malpaso, stays in his comfort zone, riding the Afro-Cuban grooves of "Percussion Bitter Sweet." The tap dancer Ayodele Casel takes the prize for courage, launching herself into the maelstrom of duets between Roach and the way-out-there pianist Cecil Taylor. April 2-7 at the Joyce Theater, Manhattan. (B.S.)
BEHIND THE GROOVE The Guggenheim Museum hosts a special edition of this long-running dance party, organized by the break dancing pioneers and custodians of hip-hop culture Kwikstep (Gabriel Dionisio) and Rokafella (Ana Garcia). Behind the Groove first emerged in 2009, when street and club dancers found themselves increasingly unwelcome at New York City bars and clubs. Rokafella, in an interview, described it as "our response to this bottle-service lounge nightlife that was replacing the dance club heyday of New York City," a place for "just jamming." Over the years, the party has found a home at freestyle-friendly locations like Le Poisson Rouge, the Nuyorican Poets Café and, most recently, Bogart House. Its incarnation at the Guggenheim, presented by Works & Process, brings together dancers and DJs for a night of breaking, house, hustle, popping, locking and other styles. Come to dance or just to watch. March 18 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Manhattan. (SIOBHAN BURKE)
TRISHA BROWN DANCE COMPANY During Brown's lifetime, her company was a laboratory for her wild movement invention; after her death in 2017, it became devoted to preserving her legacy. But it's hard to sustain a company through preservation alone. In the past two years, the troupe has entered a promising new chapter of inviting outside choreographers in, commissioning new dances that converse with its founder's. The latest is by the French contemporary choreographer Noé Soulier -- a nod to Brown's connections with France, where she developed an ardent following. Soulier's "In the Fall" shares a program at the Joyce Theater with two Brown gems: "Working Title" (1985), an exploration of speed and taking flight; and "Glacial Decoy" (1979), her first work for the proscenium stage and a stealthy response to that traditional frame, with designs by Robert Rauschenberg. Traces of the old will surely find their way into the new. March 26-31 at the Joyce Theater, Manhattan. (S.B.)
Classical
'EUROPERAS 3 & 4' No two performances will be the same with this John Cage double bill, a collage taken from the European opera canon and determined by chance -- not only the music, but also the costumes and the lighting design. Cage's idea was to take a European tradition (Euro operas, get it?) and send it back (your operas, get it?) from an American composer (himself) with playful chaos. In 2018, Yuval Sharon grandly staged "Europeras 1 & 2" at Sony's film studios in Los Angeles, with the idea that Hollywood is an American analogue for European opera house. Now, as the artistic leader of the freshly innovative Detroit Opera, he will follow up that production with Cage's comparatively intimate sequels. For some star power, the great mezzo-soprano Susan Graham and the mighty bass-baritone Davóne Tines have been cast in "Europera 4." March 8-10 at the Gem Theater, Detroit. (JOSHUA BARONE)
DANISH STRING QUARTET So far, the artistic projects of this group have been all about juxtaposition. The Prism series drew a line from Bach fugues to late Beethoven quartets and their 20th-century successors -- all communicated with the Danish players' thoroughly considered, yet never mannered, interpretation, and a lithe, anti-Golden Age sound that can break your heart with its spareness. Even more satisfying has been the four-part Doppelgänger, which pairs late Schubert with world premieres. It reaches its conclusion with Schubert's String Quintet in C, some of the most moving and sublime music ever written, followed by a new string quintet by Thomas Adès, one of the few living composers whose works can hold their own against the standard repertoire. But that's not all. Because of pandemic delays, there will still be more Doppelgänger to come: Part One belatedly arrives at Carnegie Hall next year. April 18 at Zankel Hall, Manhattan. (J.B.)
'AN AMERICAN SOLDIER' It's a small miracle whenever a contemporary opera gets a revival, much less a second production. But this work, by Huang Ruo, with a libretto by David Henry Hwang, is about to get its third, at the Perelman Performing Arts Center. The earliest form of the opera -- the tragic true story of Pvt. Danny Chen, who grew up in Manhattan's Chinatown and enlisted in the Army, then was found dead at his base in Afghanistan -- premiered in Washington as a one-act in 2014. I saw an expanded, two-act version at Opera Theater of St. Louis in 2018. Even in rehearsal, I was immediately struck by its smartly controlled stylistic eclecticism, its underlying tension of anxiety and aspiration, and its libretto's ability to remain propulsive while jumping back and forth between a courtroom drama and flashbacks. This latest staging will be directed by Chay Yew, of "Cambodian Rock Band" and "Sweatshop Overlord." May 12-19 at the Perelman Performing Arts Center, Manhattan. (J.B.)
HEARTBEAT OPERA'S 'EUGENE ONEGIN' Among the most successful of the so-called indie opera companies to emerge over the past 20 or so years, Heartbeat Opera has carved out a niche with trimmed-down modernizations of canonical works. But beyond the ripped-from-the-headlines concepts -- a "Fidelio" for the Black Lives Matter generation, a "Der Freischütz" about gun culture and toxic masculinity -- stands the wizard of the operation: the music director and arranger Dan Schlosberg, whose imaginative chamber orchestrations have the capacity to reinvent opera's most beloved scores. Yes, Heartbeat's new "Eugene Onegin" has a timely topic, exploring Tchaikovsky's sexuality against a contemporary backdrop of the Russian government's hostility toward queer visibility. If you're like me, though, you will also want to hear what kind of ingenuity Schlosberg applies to the score, with nine musicians playing 15 instruments, including clarinet, French horn, harp, balalaika and some strings. April 2-13, Baruch Performing Arts Center, Manhattan. (OUSSAMA ZAHR)
'SHIFTING GROUND' The violinist Alexi Kenney wowed audiences in 2020 with a recital at the 92nd Street Y that paired the music of Bach with works by modern-day composers. Now he's back -- this time, with a new program, a slate of commissions for solo violin and a new collaborator: the visual artist Xuan, a classically trained pianist who uses animation, abstract scenery and videos to bring music to life. The 60-minute concert is presented as five chapters, each pairing Bach's works with modern pieces. The Allemande from Bach's Second Partita, for example, is performed alongside works by Rafiq Bhatia and Paul Wiancko. Other featured composers include Salina Fisher, Angélica Negrón and Kaija Saariaho. It's all a nod to the concept of the ground bass -- a recurring melodic pattern that underpins many compositions, from Bach's era to the present. April 25-27 at the Jerome Robbins Theater, Baryshnikov Arts Center, Manhattan. (JAVIER C. HERNÁNDEZ)
Pop and Jazz
HERBIE HANCOCK Acoustic or electric, in jazz or funk or electronic music, Herbie Hancock, 83, has been a titan of innovation and brainy exuberance. As pianist and composer on his own recordings, and with the Miles Davis Quintet in the 1960s, he stretched the harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary of jazz while staying grounded in the blues. Soon after synthesizers arrived, he mastered them and came up with indelible funk tunes. In concert -- solo, as a bandleader or in duets with peers like Chick Corea and Wayne Shorter -- he is constantly probing and heading out on a limb. But in recent decades he has released very few recordings. That makes his concert this spring at Lincoln Center -- leading a full band and revisiting compositions from across his career -- all the more essential. March 26, David Geffen Hall, Manhattan. (JON PARELES)
ZACH BRYAN In the last two years, Zach Bryan has released two studio albums (one of which was 34 songs long), two EPs and a live album, a prodigious level of output. Perhaps the live album tells Bryan's story best -- his concerts are raucous blood-lettings, onstage and in the crowd. His Springsteen-esque blue-collar rock makes for a rollicking show, and an emotionally expressive one. And even though he now has a No. 1 album ("Zach Bryan," released last year) and a No. 1 single ("I Remember Everything," a duet with Kacey Musgraves, which recently netted his first Grammy), Bryan's comfort zone remains onstage, on the road, with an ocean of voices shouting right back at him. March 14 and 15 at Prudential Center, Newark; March 27 and 28 at Barclays Center, Brooklyn; March 30 and 31 at UBS Arena, Elmont, N.Y. (JON CARAMANICA)
THE MAGNETIC FIELDS In 1999, the indie band the Magnetic Fields released "69 Love Songs," an ambitious but cheeky opus that considered the love song from every possible angle, and interpreted in nearly every musical genre imaginable. Even at its most irreverent -- "Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits," say -- the tracks were cleverly structured, melodically memorable and sharply penned by the group's principal songwriter, Stephin Merritt. To celebrate the triple-album's 25th anniversary, the band will perform "69 Love Songs" in its entirety over the course of two nights, two separate times. The set list is guaranteed to be an eclectic embarrassment of riches, featuring the twinkling "Busby Berkeley Dreams," the effervescent "Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side" and the earnestly romantic "Book of Love" -- along with 66 others. April 3, 4, 5 and 6 at Town Hall, Manhattan. (LINDSAY ZOLADZ)
OLIVIA RODRIGO The pop dynamo Olivia Rodrigo's second album, "Guts," is full of spunky sonic allusions to mid-90s rock -- an era the 21-year-old singer-songwriter was not around to experience firsthand. Her four dates at Madison Square Garden -- the largest venue she's headlined yet in New York -- will serve as a kind of passing of the torch, since the eternally cool alternative legends the Breeders will be opening. Rodrigo's pair of 2022 performances at Radio City Music Hall showcased an exhilarating stage presence and a balladeer's ample vocal talent, but "Guts" highlights like "Bad Idea, Right?" and "Get Him Back!" provide even more opportunities for Rodrigo -- and the audience -- to rock out. April 5, 6, 8 and 9 at Madison Square Garden, Manhattan. (L.Z.)
PINKPANTHERESS She's a 2020s-style success story: A self-invented, self-guided English songwriter, producer and singer, PinkPantheress started out building songs on samples, went viral on TikTok and quickly conquered mainstream pop. Her megahit "Boy's a Liar Pt. 2," featuring the rapper Ice Spice, has been streamed hundreds of millions of times. With a piping soprano voice that Ice Spice has compared to a "mystical fairy," PinkPantheress sings about the ups and downs of romance and identity in the digital era; she's simultaneously self-conscious and breezily tuneful. Brooklyn Paramount, April 14-15. (J.P.)
TYLER CHILDERS Last year, the traditional country music reformist Tyler Childers released "In Your Love," a vivid ache about stumbling upon a love too good to leave behind. But it was the song's video, which told the story through a relationship between two men, that elevated Childers -- a nimble musician and stoic singer from Kentucky -- into a folk hero, particularly in the moment just after the singer Jason Aldean yanked the discourse about mainstream country hard to the right. But Childers has been waging not-so-quiet war on various establishments for some time now -- keeping myriad generations-old musical traditions vibrant, calling into question the meaning of "Americana" and singing about racism in a genre that ordinarily looks the other way. And yet a funny thing has happened: The more he speaks his truth, the bigger the stages become. May 29 and 30 at Madison Square Garden, Manhattan. (J.C.)

Full text: "The Notebook" and "Cabaret" land on Broadway. Olivia Rodrigo's tour stops in Manhattan. Plus: Herbie Hancock, Heartbeat Opera and Trisha Brown Dance Company.
Broadway
THE NOTEBOOK Nicholas Sparks's 1996 novel (adapted for the screen in 2004) is now a sweeping musical tale of romantic idealism and the decades-long love between Allie and Noah. The Chicago Tribune gave a glowing review to the 2022 Chicago Shakespeare Theater premiere, and several performers from the Chicago cast, including Maryann Plunkett as Older Allie, will reprise their roles. The show features a book by Bekah Brunstetter ("This Is Us") and music and lyrics by Ingrid Michaelson, with Michael Greif and Schele Williams directing. Now playing at the Schoenfeld Theater, Manhattan.
THE WHO'S TOMMY The show, with music and lyrics by Pete Townshend who wrote the book with Des McAnuff, was on Broadway 30 years ago, but this new take, which had its premiere at the Goodman Theater in Chicago, is very heavy on visual spectacle (and, egad, how theatrical effects have changed in three decades!). Tommy is a traumatized child who witnesses violence and loses his ability to see, hear and speak. He plays mean pinball, though, and in the strange spectacle becomes something of a messiah. The leads, including Ali Louis Bourzgui (Tommy), Alison Luff (Mrs. Walker) and Adam Jacobs (Captain Walker), are revisiting the roles they played at the Goodman. Choreography is by Lorin Latarro ("Waitress"), and McAnuff directs. Performances begin March 8 at the Nederlander Theater, Manhattan.
LEMPICKA The life of the Art Deco painter Tamara de Lempicka was not a screamingly obvious topic for a Broadway musical, but an impressive team has collaborated on this show. The Polish-born Lempicka (1898-1980), who was married, twice, to men, but had female lovers as well, lived through two world wars, surrounded by cultural and political change in Russia, Paris and California. Rachel Chavkin directs a cast led by Eden Espinosa as Lempicka, who returns to the role that wowed critics in productions at the Williamstown Theater Festival and La Jolla Playhouse. The show features music by Matt Gould and lyrics by Carson Kreitzer; they collaborated on the book. Performances begin March 19 at the Longacre Theater, Manhattan.
SUFFS The hard-fought passage of the 19th amendment, which codified women's right to vote in 1919, is the focus of this musical by Shaina Taub. In addition to the challenge of being book writer, lyricist and composer, Taub also stars as Alice Paul (1885-1977), a leader of the National Woman's Party. She and a group of like-minded women, including Ida B. Wells (Nikki M. James) and Carrie Chapman Catt (Jenn Colella), battle the patriarchy and, at times, one another. Directed by Leigh Silverman. Performances begin March 26 at the Music Box Theater, Manhattan.
HELL'S KITCHEN Alicia Keys makes her Broadway debut with this semi-autobiographical jukebox musical about a 17-year-old girl named Ali, raised in a small Manhattan apartment by her protective single mother alongside a community of artists. The show features music and lyrics by Keys, a mix of hits, including "Fallin"' and "Empire State of Mind," and new songs. The show's premiere last year at the Public Theater received decent, if not exceptional, reviews, but c'mon, this girl is on fire. The book is by Kristoffer Diaz and choreography by Camille A. Brown. Maleah Joi Moon, Shoshana Bean and Brandon Victor Dixon will reprise their roles. The busy Michael Greif (see also "The Notebook") directs. Performances begin March 28 at the Shubert Theater, Manhattan.
THE GREAT GATSBY Though the reviews from the Paper Mill Playhouse premiere this fall were not stellar, this new musical based on the 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald is Broadway bound. Marc Bruni ("Beautiful: The Carole King Musical") directs the story of the nouveau riche Jay Gatsby (Jeremy Jordan, "Newsies") who schemes to win over the moneyed -- and married -- love of his life, Daisy Buchanan (Eva Noblezada, "Hadestown"). Book by Kait Kerrigan ("The Mad Ones"); songs by Nathan Tysen and Jason Howland ("Paradise Square"). Performances begin March 29 at the Broadway Theater, Manhattan.
CABARET Eddie Redmayne recreates his Olivier Award-winning turn as the Emcee in this innovative revival of the 1966 Kander and Ebb musical, which was a hot -- and expensive -- ticket in London when it premiered in 2021. The immersive design by Tom Scutt will transform the whole theater, even its lobby, into the Kit Kat Club of Weimar Berlin. (V.I.P. tickets include preshow drinks and dinner.) The cast includes Gayle Rankin, Ato Blankson-Wood, Bebe Neuwirth and Steven Skybell. Direction by Rebecca Frecknall. Performances begin April 1 at the August Wilson Theater, Manhattan.
PATRIOTS Vladimir V. Putin was a humble deputy mayor of St. Petersburg before the Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky jump-started his rise to power. This new play by Peter Morgan ("The Crown"), which had a well-received run in London, tracks their terrifying alliance and eventual falling out, including Berezovsky's political exile. Michael Stuhlbarg, back on Broadway for the first time since 2005, will star as Berezovsky, with the English actor Will Keen reprising his Olivier Award-winning role as Putin. Rupert Goold directs. Performances begin April 1 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, Manhattan. (S.M.)
UNCLE VANYA For the Chekhov-obsessed, nothing excites like a really good cast in one of his classics, and here it is Steve Carell playing the lovesick title character, toiling away at the family farm with his niece Sonya (Alison Pill). Their lonely lives are disrupted by the arrival of Sonya's famous father (Alfred Molina) with his new wife (Anika Noni Rose). The cast also includes William Jackson Harper ("The Good Place") and Jayne Houdyshell ("The Humans"), with Lila Neugebauer ("Appropriate") directing. This Lincoln Center Theater production features a new translation by Heidi Schreck ("What the Constitution Means to Me"), who worked for a time as a teacher and journalist in St. Petersburg. Performances begin April 2 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Manhattan.
MOTHER PLAY A mother with strong ideas about her children's futures supervises her two teenage kids as they prepare to move to a new apartment in this latest from the Pulitzer Prize winner Paula Vogel ("How I Learned to Drive"). What might they unpack? Set near Washington, D.C., in 1962, the play digs into the complexities and power of family bonds. Tina Landau directs a starry cast -- Jessica Lange, Celia Keenan-Bolger ("To Kill a Mockingbird") and Jim Parsons ("The Boys in the Band") -- in this premiere from Second Stage Theater. Performances begin April 2 at the Hayes Theater, Manhattan. (STEVEN McELROY )
Off Broadway
CORRUPTION In this new play, J.T. Rogers writes about the phone-hacking scandal in Britain that threatened to bring down the media mogul Rupert Murdoch more than a decade ago. Based on the book coauthored by Tom Watson, a member of Parliament who fought back against the unsavory tactics of Murdoch's newspapers, the show features a large cast, including Dylan Baker, K. Todd Freeman, Sepideh Moafi and Seth Numrich. Directed by Bartlett Sher, who also directed Rogers's "Oslo" and "Blood and Gifts." Through April 14 at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Manhattan.
THE ALLY and DEAD OUTLAW Itamar Moses ("The Band's Visit") has a busy spring coming up. His latest, "The Ally," has its world premiere at the Public Theater in a production directed by Lila Neugebauer (also busy; see "Uncle Vanya"). It stars Josh Radnor as a Jewish college professor whose identities as a progressive and an artist are challenged when a student asks him to sign a social justice manifesto. Through March 17 at the Public Theater, Manhattan. Nearby at the Minetta Lane Theater, Audible is mounting "Dead Outlaw," a crazy-sounding tale -- based on a true story -- of a dead Western robber whose mummified remains traveled all over the country as a sideshow attraction for decades. The book is by Moses and the songs by David Yazbek (also "The Band's Visit") and Erik Della Penna. David Cromer directs. Feb. 28-April 7, Minetta Lane Theater, Manhattan.
ILLINOISE This dance-theater hybrid, based on Sufjan Stevens's 2005 concept album "Illinois," comes to the Park Avenue Armory after a well-received run at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Justin Peck is the director and choreographer. With the playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury ("Fairview"), Peck also wrote the narrative adapted from the album's tales of people, places and events in Illinois, following a central character named Henry. March 2-23 at the Park Avenue Armory, Manhattan.
LIKE THEY DO IN THE MOVIES Not a lot of information is available about this world premiere solo show written by and starring Laurence Fishburne. He has described it as "the stories and lies people have told me. And that I have told myself." Given Fishburne's magnetism onscreen and in stage roles, from Morpheus in "The Matrix" series to his Tony Award-winning turn in August Wilson's "Two Trains Running," it's a solid bet he'll be well worth our time even based only on that flimsy description. March 10-31 at the Perelman Performing Arts Center, Manhattan.
STAFF MEAL While the world falls apart, a group of lonely city dwellers take refuge inside a restaurant in this new play by Abe Koogler, who has written effectively about people who work at difficult jobs in both "Kill Floor" and "Fulfillment Center." Morgan Green, a co-artistic director of the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia, directs. April 12-May 19 at Playwrights Horizons, Manhattan.
TEETH The Playwrights Horizons season also includes this irreverent and intriguing musical adaptation of the 2007 cult classic film about a young woman with toothed genitalia. The book is by Michael R. Jackson ("A Strange Loop") and Anna K. Jacobs, with music by Jacobs and lyrics by Jackson. Sarah Benson ("Blasted") directs. Through March 31 at Playwrights Horizons, Manhattan.
SALLY & TOM Suzan-Lori Parks's new play explores the relationship between the enslaved woman Sally Hemings and her enslaver, Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, by staging a play within it. When a contemporary playwright and a director (also an interracial couple) star in this fictional show, the experience naturally impacts their own relationship. This New York premiere arrives after a 2022 debut at Minnesota's Guthrie Theater. Steve H. Broadnax III directs. March 28-April 28 at the Public Theater, Manhattan.
GRENFELL: IN THE WORDS OF SURVIVORS This is a story about a terrible fire in a London high-rise that killed dozens of people in 2017, partly because of faulty construction. The text is by Gillian Slovo, who assembled transcripts of interviews with survivors and the bereaved, and the play's premiere at the National Theater in London last year and captivated audiences and critics. Directed by Phyllida Lloyd and Anthony Simpson-Pike, the show was not without controversy as some survivors found revisiting the event to be inappropriate. April 13-May 12 at St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn.
HERE THERE ARE BLUEBERRIES In late 2006, a former U.S. Army intelligence officer sent a letter to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, saying he had a collection of photographs from Auschwitz in the 1940s. The photos offer the cruel and chilling juxtaposition of Nazi officers and employees at leisure -- and a group of young women who worked in communications happily eating blueberries -- nearby the death camp. Conceived and directed by Moisés Kaufman, a founder of Tectonic Theater Project, and co-written with Amanda Gronich, the show comes to New York following well-received productions at La Jolla Playhouse and the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C. April 17-June 2 at New York Theater Workshop, Manhattan.
THE LONELY FEW Two lesbian rockers take a stab at love in the face of intolerance after meeting in small town Kentucky in this musical, featuring a book by Rachel Bonds ("Jonah") and music and lyrics by Zoe Sarnak. After several years of development, the show had its premiere at the Geffen Playhouse last year. Trip Cullman ("Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow") and Ellenore Scott co-direct a cast that includes Lauren Patten, Taylor Iman Jones and Thomas Silcott. April 27-June 2 at MCC Theater, Manhattan.
THREE HOUSES Despite the scant details available, this new musical by Dave Malloy ("Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812") is likely to be a spring highlight. Malloy writes about the link among three strangers -- Susan in Latvia, Sadie in New Mexico and Beckett in Ireland, all haunted by grandparents -- in an exploration of the post-pandemic world. Annie Tippe directs. April 30-June 9, Pershing Square Signature Center, Manhattan. (STEVEN McELROY )
Dance
BETH GILL: 'NAIL BITER' Beth Gill, an exacting choreographer, has a spare, seductive way of revealing a stage and the dancers who inhabit it. In her highly controlled settings, space folds into time just as time folds into space. It's slow, uncanny and gripping; even the title of her latest work, "Nail Biter," is a nod to her skill at building tension. Making its long-awaited New York City premiere at N.Y.U. Skirball, "Nail Biter" explores the unease of the present moment. Transformed by Baille Younkman's arresting costumes and accessories -- a tight trench, high white boots, wigs -- the dancers come together as something of a portrait of our collective unconscious. Framed by Jon Moniaci's eerie score, "Nail Biter" has a supernatural feel, but it's not just about sensation. Gill's composition is to die for, too: It's always there to hold her vision together. April 12-13, N.Y.U. Skirball, Manhattan. (GIA KOURLAS)
DANCING THE 92nd Street Y: A 150th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION Few institutions have had a greater impact on modern dance than the 92nd Street Y, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary. Agnes de Mille once called it "the veritable cradle of the modern-dance movement," and it was instrumental in the development of Martha Graham, José Limón, Paul Taylor and many others. Where was Alvin Ailey's "Revelations" first performed? At the Y. This spring, that history will be on display in an exhibition, "Dance to Belong," and several events. For an anniversary program on March 12, the companies of Graham and Limón, along with Ailey II, will perform classics by their namesake choreographers, paired with new pieces by contemporary artists like Jamar Roberts. Better yet, on May 13, the Taylor company will recreate the "7 New Dances" program that Taylor debuted at the Y in 1957, an evening famous for its avant-garde experiments and the puzzled or hostile reviews it received, including one that was four inches of blank space. March 12 and May 13 at the 92nd Street Y, Manhattan. (BRIAN SEIBERT)
MAX ROACH 100 The music of the jazz drummer, composer and civil-rights activist Max Roach, who was born 100 years ago (and died in 2007), is rich material for dancers and choreographers, replete with rhythms that goad and challenge, spiked with messages to supply meaning. A centenary program of newly commissioned pieces at the Joyce Theater boasts a lineup worthy of the jazz legend. The hip-hop master Rennie Harris leans into the message side, choosing a track of Roach drum-talking along to Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. Ronald K. Brown, in a work combining his company with dancers from the Cuban troupe Malpaso, stays in his comfort zone, riding the Afro-Cuban grooves of "Percussion Bitter Sweet." The tap dancer Ayodele Casel takes the prize for courage, launching herself into the maelstrom of duets between Roach and the way-out-there pianist Cecil Taylor. April 2-7 at the Joyce Theater, Manhattan. (B.S.)
BEHIND THE GROOVE The Guggenheim Museum hosts a special edition of this long-running dance party, organized by the break dancing pioneers and custodians of hip-hop culture Kwikstep (Gabriel Dionisio) and Rokafella (Ana Garcia). Behind the Groove first emerged in 2009, when street and club dancers found themselves increasingly unwelcome at New York City bars and clubs. Rokafella, in an interview, described it as "our response to this bottle-service lounge nightlife that was replacing the dance club heyday of New York City," a place for "just jamming." Over the years, the party has found a home at freestyle-friendly locations like Le Poisson Rouge, the Nuyorican Poets Café and, most recently, Bogart House. Its incarnation at the Guggenheim, presented by Works & Process, brings together dancers and DJs for a night of breaking, house, hustle, popping, locking and other styles. Come to dance or just to watch. March 18 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Manhattan. (SIOBHAN BURKE)
TRISHA BROWN DANCE COMPANY During Brown's lifetime, her company was a laboratory for her wild movement invention; after her death in 2017, it became devoted to preserving her legacy. But it's hard to sustain a company through preservation alone. In the past two years, the troupe has entered a promising new chapter of inviting outside choreographers in, commissioning new dances that converse with its founder's. The latest is by the French contemporary choreographer Noé Soulier -- a nod to Brown's connections with France, where she developed an ardent following. Soulier's "In the Fall" shares a program at the Joyce Theater with two Brown gems: "Working Title" (1985), an exploration of speed and taking flight; and "Glacial Decoy" (1979), her first work for the proscenium stage and a stealthy response to that traditional frame, with designs by Robert Rauschenberg. Traces of the old will surely find their way into the new. March 26-31 at the Joyce Theater, Manhattan. (S.B.)
Classical
'EUROPERAS 3 & 4' No two performances will be the same with this John Cage double bill, a collage taken from the European opera canon and determined by chance -- not only the music, but also the costumes and the lighting design. Cage's idea was to take a European tradition (Euro operas, get it?) and send it back (your operas, get it?) from an American composer (himself) with playful chaos. In 2018, Yuval Sharon grandly staged "Europeras 1 & 2" at Sony's film studios in Los Angeles, with the idea that Hollywood is an American analogue for European opera house. Now, as the artistic leader of the freshly innovative Detroit Opera, he will follow up that production with Cage's comparatively intimate sequels. For some star power, the great mezzo-soprano Susan Graham and the mighty bass-baritone Davóne Tines have been cast in "Europera 4." March 8-10 at the Gem Theater, Detroit. (JOSHUA BARONE)
DANISH STRING QUARTET So far, the artistic projects of this group have been all about juxtaposition. The Prism series drew a line from Bach fugues to late Beethoven quartets and their 20th-century successors -- all communicated with the Danish players' thoroughly considered, yet never mannered, interpretation, and a lithe, anti-Golden Age sound that can break your heart with its spareness. Even more satisfying has been the four-part Doppelgänger, which pairs late Schubert with world premieres. It reaches its conclusion with Schubert's String Quintet in C, some of the most moving and sublime music ever written, followed by a new string quintet by Thomas Adès, one of the few living composers whose works can hold their own against the standard repertoire. But that's not all. Because of pandemic delays, there will still be more Doppelgänger to come: Part One belatedly arrives at Carnegie Hall next year. April 18 at Zankel Hall, Manhattan. (J.B.)
'AN AMERICAN SOLDIER' It's a small miracle whenever a contemporary opera gets a revival, much less a second production. But this work, by Huang Ruo, with a libretto by David Henry Hwang, is about to get its third, at the Perelman Performing Arts Center. The earliest form of the opera -- the tragic true story of Pvt. Danny Chen, who grew up in Manhattan's Chinatown and enlisted in the Army, then was found dead at his base in Afghanistan -- premiered in Washington as a one-act in 2014. I saw an expanded, two-act version at Opera Theater of St. Louis in 2018. Even in rehearsal, I was immediately struck by its smartly controlled stylistic eclecticism, its underlying tension of anxiety and aspiration, and its libretto's ability to remain propulsive while jumping back and forth between a courtroom drama and flashbacks. This latest staging will be directed by Chay Yew, of "Cambodian Rock Band" and "Sweatshop Overlord." May 12-19 at the Perelman Performing Arts Center, Manhattan. (J.B.)
HEARTBEAT OPERA'S 'EUGENE ONEGIN' Among the most successful of the so-called indie opera companies to emerge over the past 20 or so years, Heartbeat Opera has carved out a niche with trimmed-down modernizations of canonical works. But beyond the ripped-from-the-headlines concepts -- a "Fidelio" for the Black Lives Matter generation, a "Der Freischütz" about gun culture and toxic masculinity -- stands the wizard of the operation: the music director and arranger Dan Schlosberg, whose imaginative chamber orchestrations have the capacity to reinvent opera's most beloved scores. Yes, Heartbeat's new "Eugene Onegin" has a timely topic, exploring Tchaikovsky's sexuality against a contemporary backdrop of the Russian government's hostility toward queer visibility. If you're like me, though, you will also want to hear what kind of ingenuity Schlosberg applies to the score, with nine musicians playing 15 instruments, including clarinet, French horn, harp, balalaika and some strings. April 2-13, Baruch Performing Arts Center, Manhattan. (OUSSAMA ZAHR)
'SHIFTING GROUND' The violinist Alexi Kenney wowed audiences in 2020 with a recital at the 92nd Street Y that paired the music of Bach with works by modern-day composers. Now he's back -- this time, with a new program, a slate of commissions for solo violin and a new collaborator: the visual artist Xuan, a classically trained pianist who uses animation, abstract scenery and videos to bring music to life. The 60-minute concert is presented as five chapters, each pairing Bach's works with modern pieces. The Allemande from Bach's Second Partita, for example, is performed alongside works by Rafiq Bhatia and Paul Wiancko. Other featured composers include Salina Fisher, Angélica Negrón and Kaija Saariaho. It's all a nod to the concept of the ground bass -- a recurring melodic pattern that underpins many compositions, from Bach's era to the present. April 25-27 at the Jerome Robbins Theater, Baryshnikov Arts Center, Manhattan. (JAVIER C. HERNÁNDEZ)
Pop and Jazz
HERBIE HANCOCK Acoustic or electric, in jazz or funk or electronic music, Herbie Hancock, 83, has been a titan of innovation and brainy exuberance. As pianist and composer on his own recordings, and with the Miles Davis Quintet in the 1960s, he stretched the harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary of jazz while staying grounded in the blues. Soon after synthesizers arrived, he mastered them and came up with indelible funk tunes. In concert -- solo, as a bandleader or in duets with peers like Chick Corea and Wayne Shorter -- he is constantly probing and heading out on a limb. But in recent decades he has released very few recordings. That makes his concert this spring at Lincoln Center -- leading a full band and revisiting compositions from across his career -- all the more essential. March 26, David Geffen Hall, Manhattan. (JON PARELES)
ZACH BRYAN In the last two years, Zach Bryan has released two studio albums (one of which was 34 songs long), two EPs and a live album, a prodigious level of output. Perhaps the live album tells Bryan's story best -- his concerts are raucous blood-lettings, onstage and in the crowd. His Springsteen-esque blue-collar rock makes for a rollicking show, and an emotionally expressive one. And even though he now has a No. 1 album ("Zach Bryan," released last year) and a No. 1 single ("I Remember Everything," a duet with Kacey Musgraves, which recently netted his first Grammy), Bryan's comfort zone remains onstage, on the road, with an ocean of voices shouting right back at him. March 14 and 15 at Prudential Center, Newark; March 27 and 28 at Barclays Center, Brooklyn; March 30 and 31 at UBS Arena, Elmont, N.Y. (JON CARAMANICA)
THE MAGNETIC FIELDS In 1999, the indie band the Magnetic Fields released "69 Love Songs," an ambitious but cheeky opus that considered the love song from every possible angle, and interpreted in nearly every musical genre imaginable. Even at its most irreverent -- "Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits," say -- the tracks were cleverly structured, melodically memorable and sharply penned by the group's principal songwriter, Stephin Merritt. To celebrate the triple-album's 25th anniversary, the band will perform "69 Love Songs" in its entirety over the course of two nights, two separate times. The set list is guaranteed to be an eclectic embarrassment of riches, featuring the twinkling "Busby Berkeley Dreams," the effervescent "Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side" and the earnestly romantic "Book of Love" -- along with 66 others. April 3, 4, 5 and 6 at Town Hall, Manhattan. (LINDSAY ZOLADZ)
OLIVIA RODRIGO The pop dynamo Olivia Rodrigo's second album, "Guts," is full of spunky sonic allusions to mid-90s rock -- an era the 21-year-old singer-songwriter was not around to experience firsthand. Her four dates at Madison Square Garden -- the largest venue she's headlined yet in New York -- will serve as a kind of passing of the torch, since the eternally cool alternative legends the Breeders will be opening. Rodrigo's pair of 2022 performances at Radio City Music Hall showcased an exhilarating stage presence and a balladeer's ample vocal talent, but "Guts" highlights like "Bad Idea, Right?" and "Get Him Back!" provide even more opportunities for Rodrigo -- and the audience -- to rock out. April 5, 6, 8 and 9 at Madison Square Garden, Manhattan. (L.Z.)
PINKPANTHERESS She's a 2020s-style success story: A self-invented, self-guided English songwriter, producer and singer, PinkPantheress started out building songs on samples, went viral on TikTok and quickly conquered mainstream pop. Her megahit "Boy's a Liar Pt. 2," featuring the rapper Ice Spice, has been streamed hundreds of millions of times. With a piping soprano voice that Ice Spice has compared to a "mystical fairy," PinkPantheress sings about the ups and downs of romance and identity in the digital era; she's simultaneously self-conscious and breezily tuneful. Brooklyn Paramount, April 14-15. (J.P.)
TYLER CHILDERS Last year, the traditional country music reformist Tyler Childers released "In Your Love," a vivid ache about stumbling upon a love too good to leave behind. But it was the song's video, which told the story through a relationship between two men, that elevated Childers -- a nimble musician and stoic singer from Kentucky -- into a folk hero, particularly in the moment just after the singer Jason Aldean yanked the discourse about mainstream country hard to the right. But Childers has been waging not-so-quiet war on various establishments for some time now -- keeping myriad generations-old musical traditions vibrant, calling into question the meaning of "Americana" and singing about racism in a genre that ordinarily looks the other way. And yet a funny thing has happened: The more he speaks his truth, the bigger the stages become. May 29 and 30 at Madison Square Garden, Manhattan. (J.C.)

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One of the most consequential scenes in video game history is being remade by the creators of Final Fantasy VII. Will they kill Aerith again?
There were early warnings in the 1997 role-playing game Final Fantasy VII that Cloud Strife harbored delusions of grandeur. An identity borrowed from an old war buddy. Genetics spliced from a parasitic alien. A toxic relationship with a super soldier.
But it was the moment Cloud unwillingly raised a sword toward Aerith Gainsborough, his affectionate companion, that it appeared he had lost all self-control. Not until his weapon lowered could players relax.
And then, a twist.
After the screen faded into an animated sequence, Sephiroth, the evil super soldier with silver hair and snake eyes, appeared from the skies without warning to plunge a sharp katana through Aerith's back.
Her death was permanent, an inconceivable notion when video games were known for giving characters extra lives. As Aerith collapsed, so did a narrative trope that had restricted the medium's dramatic potential.
"I felt it was imperative for us to show the gravity and rawness of loss," said Tetsuya Nomura, the Square Enix director responsible for developing the traumatizing scene.
"In many dramas, there is often this crescendo of conversation between characters before a loss occurs," he said through an interpreter. "But doing it this way, the loss would have felt too contrived. I wanted to express a loss where one felt there was so much more to talk about. You wanted to speak with her, but she is no longer there."
Nomura, who also created the Kingdom Hearts series, has returned as a creative director on a trilogy that is remaking Final Fantasy VII for a new generation. Its second installment, Rebirth, will be released for the PlayStation 5 on Feb. 29 and is expected to end with the climactic death -- or rescue? -- of Aerith.
"Everyone has a theory," said Briana White, who voices Aerith in the new game. "I can't say that I had orange juice for breakfast without people asking what it means."
The trilogy often seems like a commentary on the very concept of a remake: Can you change what has already happened? Can a creator ever satisfy devoted fans, many of whom have not stopped mourning Aerith's death? Its first installment, released in 2020, had unexpected departures from the original plot and an ending where characters seemed to defy fate.
Video games were just entering the third dimension when the Japanese studio then called Square started planning its seventh game in the Final Fantasy anthology series.
Developers attempted to circumvent technical challenges of the original PlayStation by layering complicated digital geometry with prerendered images. A fixed camera provided a cinematic flair through the techniques of filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, who used high-angle shots to convey anxiety and panic. Perspective shifts in cut scenes added to the tension.
"This was the most immersive experience that you could possibly have on your living room television at the time," said Wade Wallerstein, a digital anthropologist specializing in video games. "It showcased the storytelling potential of video games, that they could be more than puzzles but narratively rich worlds."
Role-playing games like Final Fantasy VII often take dozens of hours to complete, time spent learning characters' back stories while trying to keep them alive. (Fans of the original might know the slain character as Aeris, because of a mistranslation in the English version of the game.) Those relationships can outlast ones forged through television shows and novels, Wallerstein said, because players are implicated in the survival of their heroes.
"This is why I think Aerith's death is more impactful to me than Dumbledore's death in the Harry Potter books, for example," Wallerstein said. "And it set the standard for later games like The Last of Us, where these unexpected deaths feel personal."
Final Fantasy VII is largely a meditation on destructive cycles of life and death. The game begins with Cloud joining an eco-terrorist mission to destroy a reactor that is draining the planet's energy. The city where that sequence takes place is ruled by the Shinra Corporation, which holds its headquarters and wealthier neighborhoods on a system of metal plates cantilevered above the slums.
Eventually, Cloud and his companions embark on a tour of corporatocracy: military barracks built atop a fishing village, a glitzy casino stationed above a desert prison, a religious site transformed into a tourist trap.
Most R.P.G.s at the time were set in medieval fantasy worlds, but the development team wanted to create something iconoclastic. Capitalism and science run amok became central to the plot.
"We were thinking about taking the evil king and transitioning that into a more nefarious force," Yoshinori Kitase, a producer on the remakes who directed the original game, said through an interpreter.
The dark politics of Final Fantasy VII remain surprising because few games bite into allegory. It was produced during Japan's Lost Decade, when the country's postwar economic miracle ended in deflation and a collapsed real estate market.
Rachael Hutchinson, who teaches a course on Japanese culture through video games at the University of Delaware, said an agitated population was protesting nuclear energy and worried about human cloning. The country was also reeling from back-to-back tragedies in 1995, when the Great Hanshin earthquake killed about 6,400 people and doomsday cultists released sarin gas in the Tokyo subways.
"People were feeling powerless after these natural disasters and terrorist acts," Hutchinson said. "The bedrock of society was shaking."
Within the allegory of Final Fantasy VII, a woman like Aerith was supposed to be the solution. The last survivor of an ancient race with mystical powers that were indigenous to the planet, she was a white mage, responsible for using spells to heal allies in combat.
Aerith also served as a metaphor for Cloud's hope, said the game designer Thierry Boulanger, who first played Final Fantasy VII when he was 12. Fluent only in French at the time, he understood most of the story through the blocky movements of its characters. Until Aerith's demise, he had assumed she was a vision.
"That was my first experience with grief," he said.
Players distraught by Aerith's death have long wondered whether her fate could be altered. For an April Fool's Day prank several years ago, Randall Rigdon Jr. stitched together playground rumors that Aerith could be resurrected with some legitimate mysteries.
Why had developers left behind Aerith's flickering ghost inside the church where Cloud first meets her? And why did they program a version of Aerith who says, "Silly ... Didn't anyone tell you? This IS Hades," if there was no chance of rescuing her from that hell?
Rigdon said the outrage he received for his YouTube video, which now has 2.2 million views, was a testament to Final Fantasy VII's dramatic achievements.
"People are used to heroic deaths instead of tragic ones," Rigdon said. "Gamers are used to controlling the fates of their characters, but the developers took away the agency of players to decide."
The creators behind Final Fantasy VII Rebirth are keenly aware that they tampered with the social contract by killing Aerith decades ago. Rebirth draws players even deeper into the lives of its characters with segments where they can help Cloud learn piano or wander through a coastal resort on a scooter. Downtime humanizes the experience.
"When there are moments of peace and quiet -- seeing waterfalls, picking flowers or playing with children -- those moments tend to precipitate something else," said Lea Salonga, the Broadway actor, who has played the Final Fantasy series for years.
Within the remake trilogy, ghostly figures called "whispers" symbolize fate -- and the desire of some fans to keep the new games aligned with the original story. In trailers for Rebirth, whispers appear to swirl around Aerith before Sephiroth's arrival.
"The whispers are a vehicle to enact change," Naoki Hamaguchi, the new game's director, said through an interpreter. "If we were to deliver the exact same storyline for players to experience, this would be difficult in sustaining interest."
In the sequence leading to Aerith's death in the original game, Cloud and his companions enter a mythical city made of crystal and conch shells. The metallic echoes of synthesizers become the soft chimes of a music box as the player descends a floating staircase to find Aerith silently in prayer.
Cloud has been losing control of his body to Sephiroth, who is able to manipulate him like a puppet because of a genetic link they share. Cloud's last words before Aerith's death: "Ugh ... What are you making me do."
The animations are rough by today's standards, and there is an unfinished quality to the sequence; the scenery is inconsistent and a checkerboard appears just below Aerith's knees. But the results were effective at a time when most games were still flat, pixelated adventures.
"They did something so deep while using early technology that it shocked people into having a strong connection with the game," said Boulanger, the creative director on last year's Sea of Stars.
The character's death is punctuated by "Aerith's Theme," a motif by Nobuo Uematsu that has become a popular instrumental score. Arnie Roth, a conductor known for staging concerts of video game music, will play the song at Carnegie Hall in June.
"The melody is very compelling. Bah dah dee, bah dah dum," Roth hummed during an interview. "With 'Aerith's Theme,' you can hear Nobuo pulling on Impressionist and Romantic influences. People ask us if they can propose marriage at our concerts before we play it."
These emotions are allowed to linger in Rebirth, according to Cody Christian, who voices Cloud in the trilogy. "We do not shy away from injecting that scene with heartfelt sympathy for the characters," he said. "Our performance was meant to humanize it."
As players exited the cut scene in 1997, Sephiroth belittles Aerith's death, saying she soon will become part of the planet's energy. In the Japanese text (but not the flawed English translation), Sephiroth describes the assassination as nothing more than a "detour," taunting Cloud to follow him into the snowy fields where he intends to become a god.
Cloud then exhibits signs of a panic attack: "My fingers are tingling. My mouth is dry. My eyes are burning."
When Sephiroth finally leaves, Cloud is forced to confront the manifestation of a parasitic alien as "Aerith's Theme" continues to play in the background.
Nomura said he wanted the surviving characters to immediately achieve the threshold needed for an ultimate attack, as a way to signify their heightened emotions. But the era's technology impeded that vision.
The battle still forced players to reckon with Aerith's absence, Boulanger said. Suddenly, the character with the best healing abilities was gone.
For Nomura, those feelings were personal.
"The weight of loss is felt more deeply these days, certainly, now as I age and at times lose some people around me," he said, pausing.
"I certainly feel the weight and gravity of loss much more so now."

Marley Film Starts Strong, but Not 'Madame Web': [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "One Love" landed in what has become a box office sweet spot -- stories that feel both nostalgic and new -- while the Spider-Man spinoff is another sign that the comics-character boom is over.
The sleepy United States box office finally lifted its eyelids over the holiday weekend. "Bob Marley: One Love," a feel-good musical biopic, was on track to take in $ 33.2 million from Friday through Monday, for a strong total of roughly $ 51 million since opening on Valentine's Day, according to Paramount Pictures.
"Excuse me while I light my spliff," read a celebratory post on the official X account for Marley, who died in 1981.
"One Love," which cost about $ 70 million to make, landed in what has emerged over the last year as a box office sweet spot -- stories that feel both nostalgic and new -- allowing it to overcome weak reviews, box office analysts said. (Marley has never before been the subject of a big-screen musical biopic.)
But the movie business, for the most part, was anything but euphoric. The weekend's other new wide-release movie, "Madame Web," based on a minor character from the Spider-Man comics, added to what has recently been a clear message from ticket buyers: The comics-character boom is over. "Madame Web" was on track to sell $ 17.6 million in tickets from Friday through Monday, for a total of $ 25.8 million since arriving on Valentine's Day, according to Sony Pictures.
Ticket sales for "Madame Web" were among the lowest ever for a superhero movie -- a genre that, for decades, has been one of Hollywood's most reliable moneymakers. To compare, "Elektra," considered a hall-of-fame superhero misfire, collected $ 12.8 million over its first three days in 2005, or about $ 21 million in today's dollars.
It's not that superhero movies are finished. Rather, "the superhero universe is no longer expanding," said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. The most popular characters will continue to attract audiences, he said, pointing to early interest in "Deadpool & Wolverine," a coming superhero sequel from Marvel Studios. The first "Deadpool & Wolverine" trailer, released during the Super Bowl, generated more than 365 million views online in its first 24 hours, setting a record.
"Madame Web" received disastrous reviews; one critic called it the "Cats" of superhero movies. The film, directed by S.J. Clarkson, whose previous experience was mostly in television, and starring an all-female ensemble led by Dakota Johnson, was also undercut by some of the same misogyny that thwarted female-oriented films like "The Marvels" and "Ghostbusters" (2016). Social media users and some movie sites reveled in slashing apart "Madame Web" in general and Ms. Johnson in particular.
In financial terms, it was not a catastrophe for Sony -- not compared with "The Marvels," which cost Disney an estimated $ 220 million to make and collected only $ 200 million worldwide last year. (Studios receive about 50 percent of ticket sales, with theaters keeping the balance.) "Madame Web," intended as a thriller for young women, cost about $ 80 million to make, partly because it did not rely on lavish visual effects. (Her only superpower is clairvoyance.)
"Madame Web" collected an additional $ 26 million in partial international release over the weekend.
"Bob Marley: One Love," directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green ("King Richard") and starring Kingsley Ben-Adir, sold about $ 29 million in tickets overseas, where it was also playing in partial release.
Theaters have been ghost towns on some weekends this year, a result of big-budget movies like "Argyle" that failed to entice ticket buyers, Oscar-oriented art films that have not crossed over to the mainstream and fewer wide releases. For the year so far, theaters in the United States and Canada have sold about $ 764 million in tickets, down 15 percent from the same period last year, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data.
The slowdown was particularly pronounced on Super Bowl weekend, when domestic theaters collected just $ 38.9 million, the worst result for a Super Bowl weekend -- excluding the pandemic year of 2021 -- since at least the mid-1980s, when comprehensive box office records began to be compiled, according to Comscore.
Several big movies, including "Dune: Part Two," will arrive in the weeks ahead. But the box office is expected to continue to struggle, partly because studios pushed several films off the March release calendar as a result of the union strikes that shut down production for much of last year. "Disney's Snow White," for instance, was once set to arrive on March 22. Citing production delays, Disney bumped it to March 2025.
"This isn't another industry existential crisis -- we had those and we're past them," Mr. Gross said. "Moviegoing has proven itself during the last couple of years. This is a release schedule, product-driven problem that will take some time to fix."

Full text: The small distributor has outsize influence because it handles Studio Ghibli films in the United States. Its titles have earned 13 Oscar nods.
When the Irish animated film "The Secret of Kells" received a surprise Oscar nomination in 2010, GKids, the boutique distribution company that mounted a stealthy but mighty grass roots campaign on its behalf, had been around for only a little over a year.
Back then, the company's entire operation consisted of two full-time employees and one part-timer. But this year, Hayao Miyazaki's "The Boy and the Heron" became GKids's 13th release in their 15-year history to receive a nomination from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for best animated feature. The hand-drawn movie has a real shot at winning and becoming the first GKids release to do so.
How has a small outfit focused on animation managed to have such an outsized effect in Hollywood?
Eric Beckman, a former music industry executive, founded GKids with the intent of redefining American audiences' perception of animation as more than a children's medium. At the time, family-friendly, computer-generated and stylistically similar studio productions had an even tighter stronghold on animation in the United States than they do today.
GKids has since filled a precious gap by consistently releasing bold animated work from around the world. For more than a decade now, it has also been entrusted with the North American distribution of titles in the catalog of the revered Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli, maker of "The Boy and the Heron."
Beckman started in animation in a roundabout way. He co-founded the New York International Children's Film Festival in 1997 with Emily Shapiro, his wife at the time. While the festival was not strictly an animation showcase, it allowed Beckman to develop meaningful relationships with numerous animation companies, including Studio Ghibli.
"I felt young people needed more intelligent, thoughtful films, and because there was no big animation festival in the States, we became the entry point for a lot of amazing animation," Beckman explained during a recent video call. He wore a T-shirt adorned with the title character of the apocalyptic Spanish tale "Birdboy: The Forgotten Children," a 2017 GKids release.
GKids first emerged as an offshoot of the festival. The name was derived from Guerrilla Kids, the moniker for the event's presenter, shortened to GKids on the festival website. He soon hired David Jesteadt, an intern at the since-defunct indie distributor New Yorker Films. He is now the president of GKids.
"From the minute Dave came on board, we communicated by osmosis," Beckman said. The two had long nurtured a love of animation -- such as "Yellow Submarine" (1968), which Beckman saw in theaters multiple times as a boy, and the bootleg VHS tapes that introduced Jesteadt to anime.
Aside from Sony Pictures Classics, which had distributed a handful of art-house animated features over the years, there was a wide-open market for GKids to help develop.
"We were a small company, so there were no rules about what we could or couldn't acquire," Jesteadt said via video call from Los Angeles, where he is based.
GKids started pursuing animated titles like their first release, Michel Ocelot's "Azur & Asmar" (released in the United States in 2008), for which other distributors couldn't envision an American audience, meaning large sums weren't needed to bid against competitors. To overcome biases against animation, the fledgling executives' strategy was not to market to young fans, even if the material was for all ages. Instead, they aimed for art-house moviegoers.
"The messaging would be: 'This belongs next to all other beautiful French cinema. It just happens to be animated, and you can bring your family too,"' Jesteadt said.
For the first four years or so, Beckman and Jesteadt worked shoulder to shoulder in a minuscule office with one window. The first breakthrough came when they acquired rights to Tomm Moore's hand-drawn, Celtic mythology-inspired "The Secret of Kells" in 2009, just in time to qualify it for Oscar consideration. With limited resources and no experience, they put together an awards campaign. "Up" won that year, but just being nominated was, as the saying goes, a true honor.
From that unexpected triumph, a fruitful bond formed with Cartoon Saloon, the Irish studio behind the film. For "The Breadwinner," which is about an Afghan girl living under Taliban rule, GKids officially became a producing partner with the studio, providing feedback early in the development process.
Moore likened the executives to fellow travelers, explaining, "You don't feel like you're just another filler title in a huge slate. They feel like an extension of our studio."
After receiving an Oscar nomination in 2012 for "Chico & Rita," a Spanish-language, adult-themed romance (their film "A Cat in Paris" was also nominated that year), the GKids executives considered changing the company moniker. Ultimately, they decided against it to avoid legal complications.
"The 'Kids' has been a misaligned part of our name since the earliest day," Beckman said.
Without the resources for the expensive campaigns typical of awards-season contenders, GKids focuses on ensuring that the animation industry sees its gems and hopes that their quality generates word-of-mouth interest. There's often an awards-qualifying theatrical run, followed by a wider release after the Academy announces the nominations; the recognition provides a promotional boost.
France's "Ernest & Celestine" (2014), which maps the unlikely friendship between a bear and a mouse; Brazil's "Boy and the World" (2015), a wordless, kaleidoscopic indictment of capitalism; and Switzerland's "My Life as a Zucchini" (2017), a stop-motion dramedy set in an orphanage, are among GKids's other Oscar-nominated standouts.
Based on GKids's growing reputation, Studio Ghibli -- through the head of its international division at the time, Steven Alpert -- asked the distributor to handle its back catalog for theatrical releases after its deal with the Walt Disney Company lapsed.
"They're a small company, and we're a small company," Beckman said. "I'd like to think we've taken care of their films really well, but I don't fully know how we got blessed with that."
The Studio Ghibli co-founder Toshio Suzuki recalled that Alpert, who knew Beckman from his days at the festival, recommended GKids because he thought there weren't "any others who are as serious as they are among distribution companies."
Releasing "The Boy and the Heron" was the ultimate test of capabilities honed over 15 years since Studio Ghibli released the film without any advance publicity in Japan. GKids's marketing materials for the film were therefore the first to see the light.
"With their small staff, GKids is able to be agile in their process, and we really appreciate that they keep in close contact with the Japanese side," Suzuki said via email. "I feel included in the promotion activities with them. Their results have exceeded our expectations."
"The Boy and the Heron," Miyazaki's first movie in a decade, debuted in theaters in December and is already Studio Ghibli's highest grossing title in the United States, as well as GKids's biggest success ever. It opened at No. 1 at the North American box office and has grossed $ 44.9 million domestically to date.
"I'm still petrified about the whole thing. It's a huge honor and a huge responsibility," Beckman said. "I'm so overwhelmed with joy that it's gone as well as it has and that audiences have embraced this film."
In 2017, GKids returned to its roots in a way, starting one of its most profitable projects, Studio Ghibli Fest, which brings classics like "My Neighbor Totoro" or "Spirited Away" to theaters across North America for special screenings every year. In 2023 alone, the screening series grossed $ 15 million.
That same year, GKids held the first edition of the Animation Is Film Festival in Los Angeles, yet another enterprise to champion animation as a cinematic art form often left out at other film events. Over four days each fall, about 12 animated features debut.
Catering to both anime fans and general audiences, today GKids straddles many aspects of the animation ecosystem. Beckman thinks of GKids, which now has about 30 employees, less as an animation specialist and more as an innovative distributor of independent fare like A24 or Neon.
"It does feel like we're in a bit of a distinct place in the market for what we're doing," Beckman said. "Animation is a good business."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actress stars as a clairvoyant in the latest entry to the Spider-Man franchise, using her charm to rise above this flat, predictable movie.
The only real bummer about "Madame Web," the latest installment in the Spider-Man chronicles, isn't that it's bad, but that it never achieves memorably terrible status. The story is absurd, the dialogue snort-out-loud risible, the fights uninspired. Even so, there are glimmers of wit and competency. And then there's its star, Dakota Johnson, who has a fascinating, seemingly natural ability to appear wholly detached from the nonsense swirling around her. Most actors at least try to sell the shoddy goods; Johnson serenely floats above it all.
A misterioso clairvoyant, Madame Web is a secondary Spider-Man character who met the web-weaver in the comics in 1980 while regally parked on a life-support system shaped like a round-bottom flask. Blind and plagued by a debilitating autoimmune disease, she had a standard super-type get-up -- a black unitard veined with lines that converge in a web -- that was offset by a white-and-black hairdo that suggested she shared a stylist with Peter Parker's editor J. Jonah Jameson. She entered with "a smell of ozone and disinfectant and age," the classy intro explained, and with "a voice that crackles like ancient parchment."
Johnson's Cassandra Webb -- Cassie for short -- is far younger and seems more like a patchouli and cannabis kind of gal, despite the frenetic wheel skills she displays in her job as a New York paramedic. Her powers haven't yet emerged when, after a preamble in the Peruvian Amazon, she is speeding through the city in 2003. As with many superheroes, Cassie has a tragic back story and so on, a generic burden that Johnson's palpably awkward charm humanizes. If the actress at times seems understandably baffled by the movie she's in, it's because she hasn't been smoothed into plastic perfection by the star-making machinery. Johnson seems too real for the phoniness thrown at her, which is her own super power.
The British director S.J. Clarkson has multiple TV credits on her résumé, including a few episodes of the Netflix series "Jessica Jones," about the hard boozing, fighting and fornicating superhero. Johnson's Cassie is sadder and more naturally offbeat than Jones, and like most big-screen superheroes, Cassie doesn't seem to be getting any noncombative action. Yet she too doesn't fit easily in Normal World. One of the better scenes in "Madame Web" happens at a baby shower, where Cassie inadvertently wipes the smiles off the faces of a roomful of women by talking about her dead mother. It's squirmy, funny filler: the guest of honor is Mary Parker (Emma Roberts), Spidey's soon-to-be mom, who chats with his future uncle, Ben (Adam Scott).
Clarkson shares screenwriter credit with Claire Parker as well as with the writing team of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, whose collaborations include a string of critically maligned box-office fantasies: "Dracula Untold," "Gods of Egypt," "The Last Witch Hunter" and "Morbius." (That's entertainment!)
"Madame Web" hits the prerequisite genre marks, more or less, as Cassie starts developing her second-sight skills and begins shuffling into the near future and back. One of the character's more attractive attributes is that her powers are mental rather than physical, which seems to have flummoxed the filmmakers. The movie never coheres narratively, tonally or, really, any way; one problem is the people behind it don't know what to do with a woman who thinks her way out of trouble.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Nearly as annoying, the movie saddles Cassie with surrogate mom duties after she rescues three teens -- played by Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor and Sydney Sweeney -- a cute trio with absent parents, peekaboo midriffs and (surprise) special talents. Given the cultural conservatism of comic-book movies, it's no surprise that Cassie only briefly evades gender duties, and at least Johnson makes Cassie's flustering protective bit bearable. The teens are onboard to expand the Spider-world and presumably help seduce a new generation of true believers; yet while the performers are fine, these characters are as formulaic as the villain, Ezekiel Sims (a brutally miscast Tahar Rahim), who soon overstays his welcome.
Spider-Man has been a monster hitmaker for Sony, so it's obvious why it keeps squeezing the character for new material. (It bought the film rights to Spider-Man from Marvel in 1999.) That it's releasing "Madame Web" in the wake of last year's imaginatively animated "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" isn't surprising; when a company throws every desperate idea at the wall, failure is inevitable. The most interesting thing about this particular one is that Johnson's performance lightly complicates the oft-repeated belief that when it comes to superhero movies, the intellectual property matters more than any star (Tobey Maguire, etc.). "Madame Web" is a dud, but it's one that Johnson transcends long before the final credits roll.

Survey Shows 17 Percent of Gamers Identify as L.G.B.T.Q.: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In its first survey of the video game industry, the advocacy group GLAAD determined that few console games include queer characters.
Less than 2 percent of console video games include L.G.B.T.Q. characters or story lines even though 17 percent of gamers are queer, according to GLAAD's first survey on the industry.
The survey, whose results were released on Tuesday, said a majority of respondents had experienced some form of harassment when playing online. But it also found that many queer gamers saw virtual worlds as an escape in states where recent legislation has targeted L.G.B.T.Q. people. Seventy-five percent of queer respondents from those states said they could express themselves in games in a way they did not feel comfortable doing in reality.
"That is a statistic that should pull on everyone's heartstrings," said Blair Durkee, who led the advocacy group's survey alongside partners from Nielsen, the data and marketing firm. "The statistic is driven largely by young gamers. Gaming is a lifeline for them."
GLAAD has produced a similar breakdown of queer representation in television since 1996. Its latest report found that 10.6 percent of series regulars in prime-time scripted shows identified as L.G.B.T.Q., which researchers said helped put their video game study in perspective.
Tristan Marra, GLAAD's head of research and reports, said that there were nearly 1,500 participants in the video game survey and that researchers used public information to meticulously search for inclusive content in games that are available on the PlayStation, Xbox and Switch digital libraries.
"I am deep into gaming and still have a hard time naming" L.G.B.T.Q. characters, said Raffy Regulus, a founder of NYC Gaymers, which hosts game nights in the city. Regulus pointed to Ellie from The Last of Us and Venture from Overwatch 2 as some recent examples.
GLAAD said it reached out to major companies, including Sony and Nintendo, for its survey but did not receive a response.
"It helped validate what we know about the critically important role that gaming plays," Marra said. "We wanted to talk about the moral case and the business case."
The report cites data indicating that global revenue for gaming surpasses that of film and music combined, with younger generations spending nearly as much time playing games as watching television. It also indicates that many queer players want to see themselves represented in games.
"The findings of this report send a powerful message to the industry: It is time to move past the idea that L.G.B.T.Q.-inclusive games are a separate, niche category," Durkee said. "All games should strive to reflect the people who play them."
In recent years, GLAAD has consulted on efforts to improve queer representation in games like The Sims 4 and Tell Me Why, which the organization said included the first playable transgender character in a major studio game.
Some players have observed gradual improvements in the diversity of the gaming industry, though they say it can feel like progress happens at a snail's pace.
"I would like to see the gaming industry hire more gay people and give them the tools in order to better reflect our lived experiences," Regulus said.

Sony Makes a Deal for Michael Jackson's Catalog: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The richest music catalog deal to date would give Sony half of Jackson's recorded music and songwriting rights, valuing the total collection at $ 1.2 billion or more.
Sony has agreed to acquire half of Michael Jackson's catalog from the star's estate, in what is likely the richest transaction ever for a single musician's work, according to two people briefed on the agreement.
The deal, which has been gossiped about in the music industry for months, is said to involve Sony purchasing a 50 percent stake in Jackson's recorded music and songwriting catalogs. That includes not only the estate's share of megahits like "Beat It" and "Bad," but also the music publishing assets that are part of Jackson's Mijac catalog, among them songs written by Sly Stone and tracks made famous by artists like Ray Charles and Jerry Lee Lewis.
The deal is said to value Jackson's assets at $ 1.2 billion or more, according to the two people, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it. Even so, it leaves some of the estate's interests in other lucrative Jackson-related businesses off the table, like the Broadway musical "MJ," Cirque du Soleil's Jackson-themed shows, and a biopic in the works that is set to star Jaafar Jackson, a son of Jackson's brother Jermaine.
The transaction is said to leave the estate a significant degree of control over the catalog. That contrasts with many other blockbuster catalog deals in recent years, like those with Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon. While those sales sometimes include finely negotiated parameters over how an artist's work can be used in the future -- say, in commercials or political endorsements -- they generally hand over management of songs to a buyer.
Representatives of Sony and the Jackson estate declined to comment on the deal, which was first reported by Billboard. When asked about the news of the deal, John Branca, who was Jackson's entertainment lawyer in life and has been the co-executor of Jackson's estate, said: "As we have always maintained, we would never give up management or control of Michael Jackson's assets."
Primary Wave, a music company that owns a minority stake in Jackson's music publishing interests, was not a party to the transaction; a representative of Primary Wave declined to comment.
To a large extent, the deal is an endorsement of the continued star power of Jackson, and the enduring global appeal of his music, 15 years after his 2009 death at age 50, on the eve of a comeback concert series in London.
That appeal has not diminished even in the face of challenges like "Leaving Neverland," a two-part documentary broadcast by HBO in 2019 in which two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, recounted what they said was years of sexual abuse by Jackson when they were children. The Jackson estate called the film "tabloid character assassination" and said that Robson and Safechuck had previously denied under oath that any abuse happened; Robson was a star witness at Jackson's molestation trial in 2005, at which Jackson was acquitted.
After that film was released, Branca said that it had an impact on the estate's business. But Jackson remains immensely popular with audiences. Each Halloween, streams of the song "Thriller" spike. And "MJ," the musical based on Jackson's life, opened two years ago and has grossed $ 172 million in New York, according to the Broadway League; the show also has an American touring production on the road and three international versions coming.
Jackson was long associated with Sony and its Epic label, which released his megaselling solo albums like "Thriller" and "Bad," though Jackson later recovered the rights to his recordings.
In 2016, Sony paid $ 750 million to buy out the Jackson estate's half of Sony/ATV, the music publishing giant. In 1985, Jackson had purchased ATV, a predecessor of that company -- the jewel of which was control of most Beatles songs -- for $ 41.5 million.

Seiji Ozawa, 88, Who Helped Transform Classical Music, Dies: [Biography]

Author: Oestreich, James R

Publication info: Oestreich, James R.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra for 29 years, toured widely and helped dispel prejudices about East Asian classical musicians.
Seiji Ozawa, the high-spirited Japanese conductor who took the Western classical music world by storm in the 1960s and '70s and then led the Boston Symphony Orchestra for almost 30 years, died on Tuesday at his home in Tokyo. He was 88.
The cause was heart failure, according to an announcement released on Friday by Veroza, his management office.
Mr. Ozawa had experienced years of health problems beginning in early 2010, when he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. He never fully rebounded from cancer surgery or from back problems that were made worse during his recovery, and he was hospitalized with heart valve disease later in life.
Mr. Ozawa was the most prominent harbinger of a movement that has transformed the classical music world over the last half-century: a tremendous influx of East Asian musicians into the West, which has in turn helped spread the gospel of Western classical music to Korea, Japan and China.
For much of that time, a widespread prejudice even among knowledgeable critics held that although highly trained Asian musicians could develop consummate technical facility in Western music, they could never achieve a real understanding of its interpretive needs or a deep feeling for its emotional content. The irrepressible Mr. Ozawa surmounted this by dint of his outsize personality, thoroughgoing musicianship and sheer hard work.
With his mop of black hair, his boyish demeanor and his seemingly boundless energy, he captured the popular imagination early on.
He found himself near the top of the American orchestral world in 1973, when he was named music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He scored many successes over the years, proving especially adept at big, complex works that many others found unwieldy.
He toured widely and recorded extensively with the orchestra. But his 29-year tenure, ending in 2002, was, many thought, too long for anyone's good: his own, the orchestra's or the subscribers'.
"As a young man, Ozawa displayed the greatest physical gift for conducting of anyone in his generation, and a range and accuracy of musical memory that struck awe and envy into the hearts of most musicians who encountered it," Richard Dyer, the music critic of the Boston Globe, wrote upon Mr. Ozawa's departure from the orchestra. Mr. Ozawa, he added, was "leaving the orchestra and the institution better off than he found them."
Despite being a role model for Asian musicians, Mr. Ozawa did not often speak about the challenges he faced. But he once recalled feeling some bias after he was booed during performances of Puccini's "Tosca" at La Scala in Milan in 1980.
"The sound I gave to 'Tosca' was not the 'Tosca' that they were used to," he said in "Absolutely on Music," a 2016 book of conversations between Mr. Ozawa and the novelist Haruki Murakami. "I think that's what it was. And also, of course, to some extent, as Italians, they had a hard time accepting the fact that an Asian conductor could come and conduct 'Tosca."'
Though relatively inexperienced in opera, he left Boston to become music director of the august Vienna State Opera, where he stayed until 2010. The rest of his life was mainly consumed with health issues and with dreams of a major comeback on the concert stage, which he was never able to achieve.
Seiji Ozawa was born to Japanese parents, Kaisaku and Sakura Ozawa, in Japanese-occupied Shenyang, China, on Sept. 1, 1935. (The family returned to Japan in 1944.) He studied piano as a child but gave up thoughts of a pianistic career when he broke two fingers playing rugby. He studied conducting under Hideo Saito, the pre-eminent teacher of Western music in Japan, at the Toho School of Music in Tokyo.
In 1959, Mr. Ozawa traveled to Europe on a cargo ship, bringing a motor scooter and a guitar. He won a competition for orchestral conductors that year in Besançon, France, and was invited by one of the judges, Charles Munch, then the music director of the Boston Symphony, to study at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, the orchestra's summer home in western Massachusetts.
After winning the Koussevitzky Prize for outstanding student conductors there, he returned to Europe. He studied with Herbert von Karajan in Berlin and drew the interest of Leonard Bernstein, who appointed him an assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic in 1961. He held that position until 1964.
Two years later, not yet well known, Mr. Ozawa appeared on the television show "What's My Line?," on which celebrity panelists had to guess his occupation on the basis of yes-or-no answers. It took them a while. But his ascent had already begun.
In 1964, he became artistic director of the Ravinia Festival in Illinois, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 1965, Bernstein recommended him to Walter Homburger, the managing director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, who was looking for a music director to replace Walter Susskind. Mr. Ozawa took the job, and his career took off.
He left both those positions in 1969 and was named music director of the San Francisco Symphony the next year, a post he held until 1976. He was also artistic director of the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood from 1970 to 1973, sharing the position with the composer Gunther Schuller and solidifying his standing with the Boston Symphony.
Mr. Ozawa played a role in easing tensions between China and the United States in 1979, when the Boston Symphony led a tour in China, which was still emerging from the Cultural Revolution.
Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, who then worked as the Boston Symphony's director of publicity, said that Mr. Ozawa had been critical in making the tour happen; Chinese officials, he said, felt connected to Mr. Ozawa because he had spent part of his childhood in China.
Mr. Gelb called him one of the most influential conductors of the 20th century, one who had brought new audiences to classical music.
"He had the greatest technique," he added, "and with his long hair and beads, he was a symbol of male beauty on the podium that I don't think the world had seen before."
Apart from conducting Boston Symphony concerts, Mr. Ozawa's relationship with Tanglewood over the years was somewhat halting but occasionally eventful. In 1994, the orchestra built a magnificent 1,180-seat auditorium on the campus, in Lenox, Mass. Norio Ohga, the president of the Sony Corporation, donated $ 2 million of the nearly $ 10 million it cost on the condition that the structure be named Seiji Ozawa Hall.
Storm clouds gathered a few years later when Mr. Ozawa, after years of relative inactivity at the Tanglewood Music Center, as the school was now called, asserted his prerogatives as the orchestra's music director.
Complaining of a decline in the quality of the conducting program and insufficient representation of orchestra members on the faculty, he fired a key administrator in 1996. The next year, prominent faculty members -- including the pianists Leon Fleisher, the center's artistic director; and Gilbert Kalish, its faculty chairman -- left in protest, citing a lack of any clear vision from Mr. Ozawa.
Mr. Ozawa remained active in Japan during his Boston tenure. He became honorary artistic director of the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra (now the New Japan Philharmonic) in 1980. Four years later, he helped found the Saito Kinen Orchestra, a memorial to the beloved mentor of his youth. This spawned the Saito Kinen Festival in Matsumoto in 1992; the event was renamed the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival in 2015.
After leaving the Boston Symphony in 2002, he returned to Boston as its music director laureate in 2008 for two concerts at Symphony Hall, his final appearances with the orchestra.
He last performed at Tanglewood in 2006. Mr. Ozawa canceled a scheduled return in 2010 for health reasons and had to cancel again in 2016, saying he lacked the necessary physical strength after returning to Japan from a brief period conducting in Europe.
Mr. Ozawa's shift to opera came as a surprise, given his limited experience in the genre. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1992, conducting Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin," and returned only once, in 2008, to conduct Tchaikovsky's "The Queen of Spades."
At the Vienna State Opera, he was able to fill in many gaps left by a career spent almost entirely in concert halls. But he tended to avoid the standard repertory in favor of the fringes, as in his first big splash: a new production of Ernst Krenek's jazz-tinged, Weimar-era "Jonny spielt auf" in 2003.
He was also able to conduct and tour with the Vienna Philharmonic, an elite, self-governed contingent of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra. He led the orchestra in three concerts at Carnegie Hall in 2004.
Mr. Ozawa was to make a triumphal return to Carnegie in the 2010-11 season, but the event, though in some ways the culmination of his career, had to be severely curtailed. He had traveled to New York in December 2010 hoping to conduct the Saito Kinen Orchestra in three programs at Carnegie as part of its citywide festival JapanNYC. But, having suffered through the year with bouts of sciatica, he had to scale back his efforts in each of the first two concerts to a lone major work.
He retained just enough of his youthful vigor to finish with a huge effort, conducting Britten's sprawling, deeply emotional "War Requiem." It turned out to be Mr. Ozawa's last performance in New York.
As artistic director of JapanNYC, he was scheduled to return to Carnegie in April 2011 to conduct concerts by the Seiji Ozawa Ongaku-juku, a Japanese youth orchestra. But he had to cancel that and most subsequent engagements.
Mr. Ozawa made a modest international comeback in April 2016, leading the Berlin Philharmonic at the Berliner Philharmonie and the orchestra of the Seiji Ozawa International Academy Switzerland in Paris.
He last traveled to the United States in December 2015 to accept a Kennedy Center Honor, bestowed by President Barack Obama.
He is survived by two brothers, Mikio and Toshio Ozawa; his wife, Vera; their son, Yukiyoshi, an actor; their daughter, Seira, a writer; and a grandson.
In the waning years of his life, Mr. Ozawa came to recognize the wisdom that comes from years of music making.
"A musician's special flavor comes out with age," he told Mr. Murakami in the 2016 book of conversations. "His playing at that stage may have more interesting qualities than at the height of his career."

Seiji Ozawa, the high-spirited Japanese conductor who took the Western classical music world by storm in the 1960s and ’70s and then led the Boston Symphony Orchestra for almost 30 years, died Tuesday at his home in Tokyo. He was 88.
The cause was heart failure, according to an announcement released Friday by Veroza, his management office.
Ozawa had experienced years of health problems beginning in early 2010, when he was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. He never fully rebounded from cancer surgery or from back problems that were made worse during his recovery, and he was hospitalized with heart valve disease later in life.
Ozawa was the most prominent harbinger of a movement that has transformed the classical music world over the last half-century: a tremendous influx of East Asian musicians into the West, which has in turn helped spread the gospel of Western classical music to Korea, Japan and China.
For much of that time, a widespread prejudice even among knowledgeable critics held that although highly trained Asian musicians could develop consummate technical facility in Western music, they could never achieve a real understanding of its interpretive needs or a deep feeling for its emotional content. The irrepressible Ozawa surmounted this by dint of his outsize personality, thoroughgoing musicianship and sheer hard work.
With his mop of black hair, his boyish demeanor and his seemingly boundless energy, he captured the popular imagination early on.
He found himself near the top of the American orchestral world in 1973, when he was named music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He scored many successes over the years, proving especially adept at big, complex works that many others found unwieldy.
He toured widely and recorded extensively with the orchestra. But his 29-year tenure, ending in 2002, was, many thought, too long for anyone’s good: his own, the orchestra’s or the subscribers’.
“As a young man, Ozawa displayed the greatest physical gift for conducting of anyone in his generation, and a range and accuracy of musical memory that struck awe and envy into the hearts of most musicians who encountered it,” Richard Dyer, the music critic of the Boston Globe, wrote upon Ozawa’s departure from the orchestra. Ozawa, he added, was “leaving the orchestra and the institution better off than he found them.”
Despite being a role model for Asian musicians, Ozawa did not often speak about the challenges he faced. But he once recalled feeling some bias after he was booed during performances of Puccini’s “Tosca” at La Scala in Milan in 1980.
“The sound I gave to ‘Tosca’ was not the ‘Tosca’ that they were used to,” he said in “Absolutely on Music,” a 2016 book of conversations between Ozawa and novelist Haruki Murakami. “I think that’s what it was. And also, of course, to some extent, as Italians, they had a hard time accepting the fact that an Asian conductor could come and conduct ‘Tosca.’”
Although relatively inexperienced in opera, he left Boston to become music director of the august Vienna State Opera, where he stayed until 2010. The rest of his life was mainly consumed with health issues and with dreams of a major comeback on the concert stage, which he was never able to achieve.
Seiji Ozawa was born to Japanese parents, Kaisaku and Sakura Ozawa, in Japanese-occupied Shenyang, China, on Sept. 1, 1935. (The family returned to Japan in 1944.) He studied piano as a child but gave up thoughts of a pianistic career when he broke two fingers playing rugby. He studied conducting under Hideo Saito, the preeminent teacher of Western music in Japan, at the Toho School of Music in Tokyo.
In 1959, Ozawa traveled to Europe on a cargo ship, bringing a motor scooter and a guitar. He won a competition for orchestral conductors that year in Besançon, France, and was invited by one of the judges, Charles Munch, then the music director of the Boston Symphony, to study at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, the orchestra’s summer home in western Massachusetts.
After winning the Koussevitzky Prize for outstanding student conductors there, he returned to Europe. He studied with Herbert von Karajan in Berlin and drew the interest of Leonard Bernstein, who appointed him an assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic in 1961. He held that position until 1964.
Two years later, not yet well known, Ozawa appeared on the television show “What’s My Line?,” on which celebrity panelists had to guess his occupation on the basis of yes-or-no answers. It took them a while. But his ascent had already begun.
In 1964, he became artistic director of the Ravinia Festival in Illinois, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 1965, Bernstein recommended him to Walter Homburger, the managing director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, who was looking for a music director to replace Walter Susskind. Ozawa took the job, and his career took off.
He left both those positions in 1969 and was named music director of the San Francisco Symphony the next year, a post he held until 1976. He was also artistic director of the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood from 1970-73, sharing the position with composer Gunther Schuller and solidifying his standing with the Boston Symphony.
Ozawa played a role in easing tensions between China and the United States in 1979, when the Boston Symphony led a tour in China, which was still emerging from the Cultural Revolution.
Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, who then worked as the Boston Symphony’s director of publicity, said Ozawa had been critical in making the tour happen; Chinese officials, he said, felt connected to Ozawa because he had spent part of his childhood in China.
Gelb called him one of the most influential conductors of the 20th century, one who had brought new audiences to classical music.
“He had the greatest technique,” he added, “and with his long hair and beads, he was a symbol of male beauty on the podium that I don’t think the world had seen before.”
Apart from conducting Boston Symphony concerts, Ozawa’s relationship with Tanglewood over the years was somewhat halting but occasionally eventful. In 1994, the orchestra built a magnificent 1,180-seat auditorium on the campus in Lenox, Massachusetts. Norio Ohga, the president of the Sony Corp., donated $2 million of the nearly $10 million it cost on the condition that the structure be named Seiji Ozawa Hall.
Storm clouds gathered a few years later, when Ozawa, after years of relative inactivity at the Tanglewood Music Center, as the school was now called, asserted his prerogatives as the orchestra’s music director.
Complaining of a decline in the quality of the conducting program and insufficient representation of orchestra members on the faculty, he fired a key administrator in 1996. The next year prominent faculty members — including pianists Leon Fleisher, the center’s artistic director, and Gilbert Kalish, its faculty chair — left in protest, citing a lack of any clear vision from Ozawa.
Ozawa remained active in Japan during his Boston tenure. He became honorary artistic director of the Japan Philharmonic Orchestra (now the New Japan Philharmonic) in 1980. Four years later, he helped found the Saito Kinen Orchestra, a memorial to the beloved mentor of his youth. This spawned the Saito Kinen Festival in Matsumoto in 1992; the event was renamed the Seiji Ozawa Matsumoto Festival in 2015.
After leaving the Boston Symphony in 2002, he returned to Boston as its music director laureate in 2008 for two concerts at Symphony Hall, his final appearances with the orchestra.
He last performed at Tanglewood in 2006. Ozawa canceled a scheduled return in 2010 for health reasons and had to cancel again in 2016, saying he lacked the necessary physical strength after returning to Japan from a brief period conducting in Europe.
Ozawa’s shift to opera came as a surprise, given his limited experience in the genre. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1992, conducting Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin,” and returned only once, in 2008, to conduct Tchaikovsky’s “The Queen of Spades.”
At the Vienna State Opera, he was able to fill in many gaps left by a career spent almost entirely in concert halls. But he tended to avoid the standard repertory in favor of the fringes, as in his first big splash: a new production of Ernst Krenek’s jazz-tinged, Weimar-era “Jonny spielt auf” in 2003.
He was also able to conduct and tour with the Vienna Philharmonic, an elite, self-governed contingent of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra. He led the orchestra in three concerts at Carnegie Hall in 2004.
Ozawa was to make a triumphal return to Carnegie in the 2010-11 season, but the event, though in some ways the culmination of his career, had to be severely curtailed.
He had traveled to New York in December 2010 hoping to conduct the Saito Kinen Orchestra in three programs at Carnegie as part of its citywide festival JapanNYC. But, having suffered through the year with bouts of sciatica, he had to scale back his efforts in each of the first two concerts to a lone major work. He retained just enough of his youthful vigor to finish with a huge effort, conducting Benjamin Britten’s sprawling, deeply emotional “War Requiem.” It turned out to be his last performance in New York.
As artistic director of JapanNYC, he was scheduled to return to Carnegie in April 2011 to conduct concerts by the Seiji Ozawa Ongaku-juku, a Japanese youth orchestra. But he had to cancel that and most subsequent engagements.
Ozawa made a modest international comeback in April 2016, leading the Berlin Philharmonic at the Berliner Philharmonie and the orchestra of the Seiji Ozawa International Academy Switzerland in Paris.
He last traveled to the United States in December 2015 to accept a Kennedy Center Honor, bestowed by President Barack Obama.
He is survived by two brothers, Mikio and Toshio Ozawa; his wife, Vera; their son, Yukiyoshi, an actor; their daughter, Seira, a writer; and a grandson.
In the waning years of his life, Ozawa came to recognize the wisdom that comes from years of music making.
“A musician’s special flavor comes out with age,” he told Murakami in the 2016 book of conversations. “His playing at that stage may have more interesting qualities than at the height of his career.”

Google Joins Industry Effort To Monitor A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The tech company's plan is similar to one announced two days earlier by Meta, another Silicon Valley giant.
Google, whose work in artificial intelligence helped make A.I.-generated content far easier to create and spread, now wants to ensure that such content is traceable as well.
The tech giant said on Thursday that it was joining an effort to develop credentials for digital content, a sort of "nutrition label" that identifies when and how a photograph, a video, an audio clip or another file was produced or altered -- including with A.I. The company will collaborate with companies like Adobe, the BBC, Microsoft and Sony to fine-tune the technical standards.
The announcement follows a similar promise announced on Tuesday by Meta, which like Google has enabled the easy creation and distribution of artificially generated content. Meta said it would promote standardized labels that identified such material.
Google, which spent years pouring money into its artificial intelligence initiatives, said it would explore how to incorporate the digital certification into its own products and services, though it did not specify its timing or scope. Its Bard chatbot is connected to some of the company's most popular consumer services, such as Gmail and Docs. On YouTube, which Google owns and which will be included in the digital credential effort, users can quickly find videos featuring realistic digital avatars pontificating on current events in voices powered by text-to-speech services.
Recognizing where online content originates and how it changes is a high priority for lawmakers and tech watchdogs in 2024, when billions of people will vote in major elections around the world. After years of disinformation and polarization, realistic images and audio produced by artificial intelligence and unreliable A.I. detection tools caused people to further doubt the authenticity of things they saw and heard on the internet.
Configuring digital files to include a verified record of their history could make the digital ecosystem more trustworthy, according to those who back a universal certification standard. Google is joining the steering committee for one such group, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, or C2PA. The C2PA standards have been supported by news organizations such as The New York Times as well as by camera manufacturers, banks and advertising agencies.
Laurie Richardson, Google's vice president of trust and safety, said in a statement that the company hoped its work would "provide important context to people, helping them make more informed decisions." She noted Google's other endeavors to provide users with more information about the online content they encountered, including labeling A.I. material on YouTube and offering details about images in Search.
Efforts to attach credentials to metadata -- the underlying information embedded in digital files -- are not flawless.
OpenAI said this week that its A.I. image-generation tools would soon add watermarks to images according to the C2PA standards. Beginning on Monday, the company said, images generated by its online chatbot, ChatGPT, and the stand-alone image-generation technology, DALL-E, will include both a visual watermark and hidden metadata designed to identify them as created by artificial intelligence. The move, however, "is not a silver bullet to address issues of provenance," OpenAI said, adding that the tags "can easily be removed either accidentally or intentionally."
(The New York Times Company is suing OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement, accusing the tech companies of using Times articles to train A.I. systems.)
There is "a shared sense of urgency" to shore up trust in digital content, according to a blog post last month from Andy Parsons, the senior director of the Content Authenticity Initiative at Adobe. The company released artificial intelligence tools last year, including its A.I. art-generation software Adobe Firefly and a Photoshop tool known as generative fill, which uses A.I. to expand a photo beyond its borders.
"The stakes have never been higher," Mr. Parsons wrote.

Apple's Vision Pro Headset Lacks Polish and Purpose: [Correction]

Full text: Billed as the future of computing, the $ 3,500 goggles can't replace a laptop for work. At times, wearing them also made our columnist feel nauseated.
About 17 years ago, Steve Jobs took the stage at a San Francisco convention center and said he was introducing three products: an iPod, a phone and an internet browser.
"These are not three separate devices," he said. "This is one device, and we are calling it iPhone."
At $ 500, the first iPhone was relatively expensive, but I was eager to dump my mediocre Motorola flip phone and splurge. There were flaws -- including sluggish cellular internet speeds. But the iPhone delivered on its promises.
Over the last week, I've had a very different experience with a new first-generation product from Apple: the Vision Pro, a virtual reality headset that resembles a pair of ski goggles. The $ 3,500 wearable computer, which was released Friday, uses cameras so you can see the outside world while juggling apps and videos.
Apple calls it a "spatial computer" that blends together the physical and digital worlds for people to work, watch movies and play games.
Apple declined to provide an early review unit to The New York Times, so I bought a Vision Pro on Friday. (It costs much more than $ 3,500 with the add-ons that many people will want, including a $ 200 carrying case, $ 180 AirPods and $ 150 prescription lens inserts.) After using the headset for about five days, I'm unconvinced that people will get much value from it.
The device feels less polished than past first-generation Apple products I've used. It's not better for doing work than a computer, and the games I've tried so far aren't fun, which makes it difficult to recommend. An important feature -- the ability to place video calls with a humanlike digital avatar that resembles the wearer -- terrified children during a family FaceTime call.
The headset is superb at delivering on one of its promises: playing video, including high-definition movies and your own recordings in 3-D that let you immerse yourself in past memories, which is both eerie and cool.
In the last decade, companies like Meta, HTC and Sony have struggled mightily to sell headsets to mainstream consumers because their products were cumbersome to wear, their apps were limited and they looked uncool.
The Vision Pro has a superior user interface, better picture quality, more apps and higher computing power than other headsets. But it's slightly heavier than Meta's cheaper Quest headsets, and it plugs into an external battery pack that lasts only two hours.
The ski-goggle aesthetic of the Apple product looks better than the bulky plastic headset visors of the past. But the videos posted by early adopters walking around outside with the headset -- men I call Vision Bros -- confirm that people still look ridiculous wearing tech goggles, even when they are designed by Apple.
A Better Interface
The Vision Pro is miles ahead of other headsets I've tested in making an immersive 3-D interface simple for users to control with their eyes and hands. I let four colleagues wear the headset in the office and watched all of them learn to use it in seconds.
That's because it's familiar to anyone who owns an iPhone or a similar smartphone. You'll see a grid of app icons. Looking at an app is equivalent to hovering over it with a mouse cursor; to click on it, you tap your thumb and index finger together, making a quick pinch. The pinch gesture can also be used to move around and expand windows.
The Vision Pro includes a knob called the Digital Crown. Turning it counterclockwise lets you see the real world in the background while keeping digital windows of your apps in the foreground. Turning it clockwise hides the real world with an opaque background.
I preferred to see into physical reality most of the time, but I still felt isolated. The headset cuts off part of your periphery, creating a binoculars-like effect. I confess that it was hard at times to remember to walk my dogs because I didn't see them or hear their whining, and in another session, I tripped over a stool. An Apple spokeswoman referred to the Vision Pro's safety guidelines, which advise users to clear away obstacles.
Getting Work Done
When using the headset for work, you can surround yourself with multiple floating apps -- your spreadsheet can be in the center, a notes app to your right and a browser to your left, for example. It's the 3-D version of juggling windows on a computer screen. As neat as that sounds, pinching floating screens doesn't make working more efficient because you need to keep twisting your head to see them.
I could tolerate juggling a notes app, a browser and the Microsoft Word app for no longer than 15 minutes before feeling nauseated.
The least joyful part of the Vision Pro is typing with its floating keyboard, which requires poking one key at a time. I had planned to write this review with the headset before realizing I wouldn't make my deadline.
There's an option to connect a physical keyboard, but at that point I'd rather use a laptop that doesn't add weight to my face.
The Vision Pro can also work with Mac computers, where you can mirror the screen into the headset as a virtual window that can be expanded to look like a large display. In my tests, there was a consistent lag -- each keystroke took a fraction of a second to register virtually, and the mouse cursor moved sluggishly. I also instinctively wanted to control the Mac with pinches, even though it's not set up to work that way, which was frustrating.
Next I tried the headset in the kitchen, loading a pizza recipe in the web browser while I grabbed and measured ingredients. Moving around while looking through the camera, I became nauseated again and had to remove the headset. The Vision Pro is most comfortable to use while seated. Apple advises people to take breaks to reduce motion sickness.
Video calling is now an essential part of office life, and here the Vision Pro is especially inferior to a laptop with a camera. The headset uses its cameras to snap photos of your face that are stitched into a 3-D avatar called a Persona, which Apple has labeled a "beta" feature because it is unfinished.
Personas are so cringe that people will be embarrassed to use these in a work call. The Vision Pro produced an unflattering portrait of me with no cheekbones and blurred ears. In a FaceTime call with my in-laws, they said the blur conjured 1980s studio portrait vibes.
One of my nieces, a 3-year-old, turned around and walked away at the sight of virtual Uncle Brian. The other, a 7-year-old, hid behind her father, whispering in his ear, "He looks fake."
Are We Entertained?
Video is where the Vision Pro shines. When streaming movies through apps like Disney+ and Max, you can pinch the corner of a video and drag it to expand it into a jumbo high-resolution TV; some movies, like "Avengers: Endgame" and "Avatar 2," can be viewed in 3-D. The picture looks much brighter and clearer than the quality in Meta's Quest products. Audio quality on the Apple headset is excellent, but the speakers are loud, so you'll need AirPods if you want to use them in public spaces.
The headset's two-hour battery life is not long enough to last through most feature-length movies, but in my experience, this turned out to be moot because I couldn't watch movies for more than 20 to 30 minutes before needing to rest my neck and eyes from the heavy headset.
(A caveat: The Netflix and YouTube apps are not available on the Vision Pro, but their websites work OK for streaming content.)
I prefer watching movies on my flat-screen TV because it can be shared, but there are scenarios where a headset would be useful as a personal television, like in a small apartment or on a plane, or on the couch when someone else is watching a TV show that you'd like to tune out from.
Videos shot on an iPhone 15 Pro camera or with the Vision Pro's cameras can be viewed in 3-D on the headset, a feature called spatial videos. While watching a video of my dogs eating snacks at home, I could reach out and pretend to pet them. The videos looked grainy but were delightful.
Not many games have been made for the headset yet. I tried some new Vision Pro games such as Blackbox, which involves moving around a 3-D environment to pop bubbles and solve puzzles. It looked nice, but after the novelty wore off, my interest fizzled out. It's tough to recommend the Vision Pro for virtual-reality gaming when Meta's $ 250 Quest 2 and $ 500 Quest 3 headsets have a deeper library of games.
Bottom Line
The Vision Pro is the start of something -- of what, exactly, I'm not sure.
But the point of a product review is to evaluate the here and now. In its current state, the Vision Pro is an impressive but incomplete first-generation product with problems and big trade-offs. Other than being a fancy personal TV, it lacks purpose.
Most striking to me about the Vision Pro is, for such an expensive computer, how difficult it is to share the headset with others. There's a guest mode, but there's no ability to create profiles for different family members to load their own apps and videos.
So it's a computer for people to use alone, arriving at a time when we are seeking to reconnect after years of masked solitude. That may be the Vision Pro's biggest blind spot.
Photograph Good for watching videos, but not much else: That's Brian Chen's view after trying out the Vision Pro, which he decided did not deliver on most promises.

The $3,500 wearable computer, which was released Friday, uses cameras so you can see the outside world while juggling apps and videos.
Apple calls it a “spatial computer” that blends together the physical and digital worlds for people to work, watch movies and play games.
Apple declined to provide an early review unit to The New York Times, so I bought a Vision Pro on Friday. (It costs much more than $3,500 with the add-ons that many people will want, including a $200 carrying case, $180 AirPods and $100 prescription lens inserts for people who wear glasses.) After using the headset for about five days, I’m unconvinced that people will get much value from it.
The device feels less polished than past first-generation Apple products I’ve used. It’s not better for doing work than a computer, and the games I’ve tried so far aren’t fun, which makes it difficult to recommend. An important feature — the ability to place video calls with a humanlike digital avatar that resembles the wearer — terrified children during a family FaceTime call.
The headset is superb at delivering on one of its promises: playing video, including high-definition movies and your own recordings in 3D that let you immerse yourself in past memories, which is both eerie and cool.
In the past decade, companies such as Meta, HTC and Sony have struggled mightily to sell headsets to mainstream consumers because their products were cumbersome to wear, their apps were limited and they looked uncool.
The Vision Pro has a superior user interface, better picture quality, more apps and higher computing power than other headsets. But it’s slightly heavier than Meta’s cheaper Quest headsets, and it plugs into an external battery pack that lasts only two hours.
The ski-goggle aesthetic of the Apple product looks better than the bulky plastic headset visors of the past. But the videos posted by early adopters walking around outside with the headset — men I call Vision Bros — confirm that people still look ridiculous wearing tech goggles, even when they are designed by Apple.
A Better Interface
The Vision Pro is miles ahead of other headsets I’ve tested in making an immersive 3D interface simple for users to control with their eyes and hands. I let four colleagues wear the headset in the office and watched all of them learn to use it in seconds.
That’s because it’s familiar to anyone who owns an iPhone or a similar smartphone. You’ll see a grid of app icons. Looking at an app is equivalent to hovering over it with a mouse cursor; to click on it, you tap your thumb and index finger together, making a quick pinch. The pinch gesture can also be used to move around and expand windows.
The Vision Pro includes a knob called the Digital Crown. Turning it counterclockwise lets you see the real world in the background while keeping digital windows of your apps in the foreground. Turning it clockwise hides the real world with an opaque background.
I preferred to see into physical reality most of the time, but I still felt isolated. The headset cuts off part of your periphery, creating a binoculars-like effect. I confess that it was hard at times to remember to walk my dogs because I didn’t see them or hear their whining, and in another session, I tripped over a stool. An Apple spokesperson referred to the Vision Pro’s safety guidelines, which advise users to clear away obstacles.
Getting Work Done
When using the headset for work, you can surround yourself with multiple floating apps — your spreadsheet can be in the center, a notes app to your right and a browser to your left, for example. It’s the 3D version of juggling windows on a computer screen. As neat as that sounds, pinching floating screens doesn’t make working more efficient because you need to keep twisting your head to see them.
I could tolerate juggling a notes app, a browser and the Microsoft Word app for no longer than 15 minutes before feeling nauseated.
The least joyful part of the Vision Pro is typing with its floating keyboard, which requires poking one key at a time. I had planned to write this review with the headset before realizing I wouldn’t make my deadline.
There’s an option to connect a physical keyboard, but at that point I’d rather use a laptop that doesn’t add weight to my face.
The Vision Pro can also work with Mac computers, where you can mirror the screen into the headset as a virtual window that can be expanded to look like a large display. In my tests, there was a consistent lag — each keystroke took a fraction of a second to register virtually, and the mouse cursor moved sluggishly. I also instinctively wanted to control the Mac with pinches, even though it’s not set up to work that way, which was frustrating.
Next I tried the headset in the kitchen, loading a pizza recipe in the web browser while I grabbed and measured ingredients. Moving around while looking through the camera, I became nauseated again and had to remove the headset. The Vision Pro is most comfortable to use while seated. Apple advises people to take breaks to reduce motion sickness.
Video calling is now an essential part of office life, and here the Vision Pro is especially inferior to a laptop with a camera. The headset uses its cameras to snap photos of your face that are stitched into a 3D avatar called a Persona, which Apple has labeled a “beta” feature because it is unfinished.
Personas are so cringe that people will be embarrassed to use these in a work call. The Vision Pro produced an unflattering portrait of me with no cheekbones and blurred ears. In a FaceTime call with my in-laws, they said the blur conjured 1980s studio portrait vibes.
One of my nieces, a 3-year-old, turned around and walked away at the sight of virtual Uncle Brian. The other, a 7-year-old, hid behind her father, whispering in his ear, “He looks fake.”
Are We Entertained?
Video is where the Vision Pro shines. When streaming movies through apps such as Disney+ and Max, you can pinch the corner of a video and drag it to expand it into a jumbo high-resolution TV; some movies, such as “Avengers: Endgame” and “Avatar 2,” can be viewed in 3D. The picture looks much brighter and clearer than the quality in Meta’s Quest products. Audio quality on the Apple headset is excellent, but the speakers are loud, so you’ll need AirPods if you want to use them in public spaces.
The headset’s two-hour battery life is not long enough to last through most feature-length movies, but in my experience, this turned out to be moot because I couldn’t watch movies for more than 20 to 30 minutes before needing to rest my neck and eyes from the heavy headset.
(A caveat: The Netflix and YouTube apps are not available on the Vision Pro, but their websites work OK for streaming content.)
I prefer watching movies on my flat-screen TV because it can be shared, but there are scenarios where a headset would be useful as a personal television, such as in a small apartment or on a plane, or on the couch when someone else is watching a TV show that you’d like to tune out from.
Videos shot on an iPhone 15 Pro camera or with the Vision Pro’s cameras can be viewed in 3D on the headset, a feature called spatial videos. While watching a video of my dogs eating snacks at home, I could reach out and pretend to pet them. The videos looked grainy but were delightful.
Not many games have been made for the headset yet. I tried some new Vision Pro games such as Blackbox, which involves moving around a 3D environment to pop bubbles and solve puzzles. It looked nice, but after the novelty wore off, my interest fizzled out. It’s tough to recommend the Vision Pro for virtual-reality gaming when Meta’s $250 Quest 2 and $500 Quest 3 headsets have a deeper library of games.
Bottom Line
The Vision Pro is the start of something — of what, exactly, I’m not sure.
But the point of a product review is to evaluate the here and now. In its current state, the Vision Pro is an impressive but incomplete first-generation product with problems and big trade-offs. Other than being a fancy personal TV, it lacks purpose.
Most striking to me about the Vision Pro is, for such an expensive computer, how difficult it is to share the headset with others. There’s a guest mode, but there’s no ability to create profiles for different family members to load their own apps and videos.
So it’s a computer for people to use alone, arriving at a time when we are seeking to reconnect after years of masked solitude. That may be the Vision Pro’s biggest blind spot.

Full text: My boyfriend instilled in me a passion for movies. To heal, that's where I go.
Cam and I hadn't spoken in over a year when he texted: "Hey, did you just follow me on Letterboxd?"
I had.
Seeing his name on my phone electrified something below my sternum, a marquee flickering to life after years of disuse. "Yeah is that OK?" I replied. "I needed to know what you thought of Nolan's latest."
Letterboxd is a social platform for movie lovers, a place to log what you see (with options to rate, review and "heart"), stay abreast of what your friends are screening, and keep a running want-to-watch list.
I had followed Cam in a bout of optimism, thinking that despite our heart-wrenching breakup, here was a place we could stay connected -- a plane above the egotistical gravity of earth. On Letterboxd, there are no new photos, personal updates or relationship statuses. Minimal places for jealousy to snag, for heartbreak to rear.
"TikTok told me this would happen," he wrote. "Mercury is in retrograde and an ex would reach out from the ether."
"Well, I'd blame Christopher Nolan over astrology," I texted back.
"Christopher Nolan is astrology for boys."
I smiled as I typed. "High concept with details left to fall through the cracks."
"Broad enough to be about anything," he replied.
Falling in love with Cam was an experience punctuated by movies. We met, appropriately enough, on the Warner Bros. lot, where we were both interning. In our first months together, we went to the movies weekly, seeing "American Honey," "Arrival," "Moonlight" and "La La Land."
The first time we had sex, Cam had come over to watch "Queen of Earth" on my roommate's 24-inch TV. Halfway through, I rested my feet in his lap. This, he later told me, was when he knew we would be together.
I would soon learn that, for Cam, this small-scale viewing was like seeing a Van Gogh through cracked and grease-smeared plexiglass -- a disgrace. But he was doing what we all do when we're trying to win someone over: playing it cool, eliding essential parts of ourselves for fear of rejection.
What's ironic is that these prickly characteristics, given oxygen, are what make you fall in love with someone. Spoken word lists in rom-coms -- often delivered urgently and at holiday parties -- demonstrate this again and again, love lives in peculiarities.
Two weeks after watching "Queen of Earth," Cam took me to a rerelease screening of "Interstellar." As the movie started, I rested my head on his shoulder. Cam reached over and, gently, lifted my skull upright. "Christopher Nolan did not direct this movie sideways," he whispered. Three weeks and four movies later, I told him I loved him.
For the five years we were together, Cam and I were great partners. When we broke up two years ago, it was because our lives had veered dramatically apart, our personal and professional overlap disintegrating while we were busy finding ourselves.
We tried to make it work: couple's therapy, nonmonogamy, picturesque hotel rooms. Nothing helped.
When I look at Cam's social media now, the person I see is almost unrecognizable. His physical appearance has transformed, from the color of his hair to the cadence of his gait. He has a different wardrobe and a different job in a different state; the set pieces of our lives are no longer interchangeable.
But on Letterboxd, Cam is unchanged; I'm greeted by his diligent log of movies, same as ever. And the voice reviewing them is the one I shared my life with for five shimmering years.
"Oppenheimer" was the first Christopher Nolan movie released since Cam and I broke up, and my interest in seeing it was neutral. I watched my friends go in twos and threes, reporting back good, bad and boring experiences. With peer pressure mounting, I decided that my seeing "Oppenheimer" hinged on Cam's opinion. In the meantime, I saw "Barbie," "Theater Camp" and "Barbie" again.
Beginning on "Barbenheimer" weekend, I started checking Cam's Letterboxd. I watched as he logged "Barbie" (four-and-a-half stars out of five), "Transformers: Rise of the Beasts" (two stars), and "Talk to Me" (three-and-a-half stars). I read his reviews and felt comforted. On his page, I experienced a tablespoon of time travel -- Cam and I may not exist together presently, but the relationship we shared will never disappear.
Cam finally saw "Oppenheimer" almost a month after its release. He drove six hours, crossing state lines, because he wanted the perfect theater (IMAX), format (70 mm) and seat (H8). His patience for what he cared about deeply was immense. Cam rated "Oppenheimer" three stars, "technically incredible, but mostly hollow."
It was decided: I would not see it.
Falling in love is all about seeing how good something can be. And with Cam, I learned how to go to the movies: a large popcorn is nonnegotiable, the significance of a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine is exponential, and if there's an option to see something in a recliner, you take it. Under Cam's influence, my treatment of the movies transformed from pastime to worship.
As the curtains closed on our honeymoon phase, Cam's particular preferences became a litmus test for our relationship. A few years in, I found them grating and was desperate for variation. I wanted to go to the small, independent theaters nearby -- try new restaurants, make a date night of it. Instead, it was AMC Burbank, always AMC Burbank.
When "Dunkirk" came out, Cam insisted on seeing it in IMAX. I had no interest in war movies, but I was his perpetual plus one. The theater's steep stadium seating made me feel nauseated. All I remember about "Dunkirk" is feeling so, so cold. And worrying that if I tried to get up and leave, I might topple into the abyss.
I had my own crotchety preferences, most of which Cam accepted graciously. When we first moved in together, he adopted my 10 p.m. bedtime. When the world felt too overwhelming and I refused to see anything new, he stayed in bed with me and watched "Gilmore Girls" -- giving it the same attention as "Tree of Life." I trusted Cam to know when to push and when to retreat; letting him nudge me out of my comfort zone was undeniably good.
Three years into our relationship, we adopted a kitten who was found in the wheel well of a golf cart on the Sony lot. Cam had been campaigning for a cat since we moved in together; I wanted to wait until we had a bigger apartment. One day, without asking me, Cam drove to the lot and returned with that kitten curled in his lap. Then we had a 1.9-pound pet with black tufted ears, and it was bliss.
The same peculiarities that signify adoration are also the first to alert you when you're falling out of love. In our last month together, Cam and I watched a series of movies that he loved, and I hated: "Annette," "Malignant," and, on our five-year anniversary, "Titane." Aggressive stories with a cold worldview.
When the credits rolled, I was furious -- not the pleasurable ire of hating bad media, but a deeper indignation. I was appalled that my partner would waste my time -- or, even worse, misunderstand me so fundamentally as to believe I would get anything from these films. The proof was onscreen: We had grown apart.
When Cam and I first broke up, all I could watch were TV shows I had seen before; I could only stand narratives when I knew how they ended.
Months passed. I started small, with independent cinemas. I saw "Licorice Pizza" and "The Worst Person in the World." As I returned to the theater, a newfound muscle memory took over, coaxing me into the world. Thanks to Cam, going to the movies felt like second nature. I was equipped with training wheels for spending time alone -- endless dates to take myself on when nothing else felt doable.
A few minutes after asking if I had followed him on Letterboxd, Cam texted again, saying that he still cared about me and seeing my name pop up like that was painful. He politely requested that I unfollow him.
With that, the illuminated marquee in my chest shuddered off. For Cam, moving on requires severance. But I don't want to let go.
To heal, I go to the movies. In the cool dark, I reacquaint with myself and the relationships that shaped me.
In "Interstellar," the fifth dimension is where gravity can transcend time, enabling communication across eras. Cam doesn't want me in his life, but I want him in mine. So I enroll in AMC A-list. I arrive early and arm myself with a large popcorn. I sit in the center. I take sanctuary.
At AMC Burbank, Nicole Kidman looks down from her silver screen and says, "Heartbreak feels good in a place like this."
She's not wrong.

A Huge Catalog of Music Is Pulled. Here's What's at Stake.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Universal Music Group, the biggest of the three major conglomerates, pulled songs by Taylor Swift, Drake and other stars after failing to agree on a new contract. Here's what's at stake.
TikTok users woke up Thursday and discovered that many videos using songs by stars like Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey, Drake and Ariana Grande had gone silent, after a public brawl between TikTok and Universal Music Group, the world's largest music company.
It was a startling turn of events for the app's creators and users, as well as for the music business, where heated negotiations over copyright permissions and royalty terms sometimes boil over into public view but rarely reach what one industry publication called the "nuclear option" -- the full-scale removal of content from one of music's biggest and most influential online outlets.
Here is a look at what happened and why, and some thoughts about what may come next.
Why did Universal Music leave TikTok?
On Tuesday, Universal Music, the global giant that releases music by hundreds of major artists, published a forceful open letter to TikTok as the end of its contract with the social media platform neared. Universal said that TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, had not adequately addressed Universal's concerns over A.I.-generated music on the platform, and that it would not agree to what Universal considered a satisfactory royalty rate.
"Ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business," the label said, "without paying fair value for the music."
Universal noted that its existing deal with TikTok was set to expire on Wednesday, and the label said it would revoke its licenses -- the legal permissions to use its music -- if an agreement was not reached. The deadline came and went, and TikTok confirmed early Thursday that it had begun removing access to Universal's vast catalog of songs.
What is Universal and which artists are involved?
Universal is the biggest of the three major music conglomerates -- the others are Sony and Warner -- that have deals with thousands of music stars to release their music. Besides Swift and Drake, its labels' biggest names include Olivia Rodrigo, Morgan Wallen, Nicki Minaj, Billie Eilish, Noah Kahan, Post Malone and Lorde, and it has deals with K-pop giants like Stray Kids and NewJeans.
The company's labels include Interscope, Geffen, Island, Def Jam, Capitol, Motown, Blue Note and Republic, and it also has an extensive music publishing division for songwriters.
Universal's chief executive, Lucian Grainge, is a seasoned talent scout who, for more than a decade, has been one of the industry's dominant corporate leaders. Most years, he tends to take No. 1 on Billboard's annual "Power 100" list. This year, he is at No. 2 -- behind Swift, with whom Grainge is said to have a close working relationship.
Universal has been aggressive in defending its artists' rights and in pursuing the best deals it can get; last year, the company sued Triller, another social media app, saying it had not paid licensing fees. Recently, Grainge has been outspoken about the need for controls and industry standards regarding the use of artificial intelligence in music.
How will the takedowns work?
When the music industry has had issues in the past with streaming outlets like Spotify, it has had the ability -- theoretically, anyway; it's always complicated -- to simply yank its content. That is what happened when Warner Music fought with YouTube for nine months in 2008 and 2009.
But TikTok is different. On the app, users upload their own video clips, and can draw from an audio library -- much of it supplied by labels like Universal -- to add background sounds. Artists and record labels also add their own content.
To comply with Universal's withdrawals, TikTok removed the company's songs from its music library, which made those songs unavailable for new clips. For older videos that already had music from Universal in them, TikTok on Thursday began "muting" the clips -- deleting the audio entirely, leaving silent videos. That is what happened with videos from celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Dwayne Johnson (a.k.a. the Rock), as well as on countless others; many included explanatory notes like "This sound isn't available."
On the official profile pages for artists like Swift, the sections that usually carried dozens of songs for users to feature went largely blank. (In some cases, brief snippets or user-generated mixes remained.)
The full process of removal is expected to take at least several days. A TikTok representative on Thursday did not say how many videos would be affected by Universal's withdrawal, but it could conceivably be millions.
Why is it happening?
In some ways, this is an example of a conflict that has played out repeatedly in the media business over the last couple of decades, in which the innovations of tech companies -- and, sometimes, the creativity of rule-skirting users -- has run up against the music industry's demands for control and fair compensation. This tension has been a driving force in the music industry, from Napster and YouTube to Pandora and, now, TikTok.
Universal's concerns are real, and reflect some of the most urgent challenges in the music business today: artists' need to make a decent living, the parameters of modern licensing contracts, the role of artificial intelligence. And in recent years music companies have begun to adjust to the reality that music fans' attention is not solely focused on jukebox-type streaming outlets like Spotify or Apple Music, but also on an array of social platforms, like TikTok, where music may be just one attraction.
For TikTok, as with any social media company, the issue may involve how much leverage it is willing to relinquish to any single content partner. As important as music is on TikTok -- in the past the company has said "music is at the heart of the TikTok experience" -- it does not represent the entirety of the experience on the app; as any TikTok user knows, a song could simply be the audio wallpaper for a makeup tutorial or a plumbing how-to guide.
How might this affect musicians?
This is a key consideration for Universal, which says it is pursuing a better deal for its acts. At the same time, the longer the dispute drags on, the more it may hurt artists, at least in the short term. TikTok is a vital promotional outlet, and a generation of young fans now rely on the app to discover music, old and new.
Some of the most vital moments in music in recent years happened on TikTok, from the explosion of Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road" and Olivia Rodrigo's "Drivers License" to the revival of Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams." For many artists today, being absent from TikTok would be like Madonna having a video disappear from MTV in the 1980s.
At the same time, though, artists are keenly aware of the need to secure better deals for their music, and of the low rates they face across the streaming landscape. Talk to an artist for two minutes about the business, and they will tell you they should make more money from streaming. They just do not want to sacrifice promotion, or their connection to fans, in the process.
What happens now?
We wait to see who blinks.
Universal's roster of stars gives it leverage, and losing access to a library of thousands of the world's most popular songs is not good for TikTok. Apps with a music component rely on their licensing arrangements with entertainment companies, and users expect to have a broad selection.
On the other hand, TikTok has licensing deals with many other music companies, and users could soon figure out that if they lose access to a Lady Gaga song, they could pick one from, say, Dua Lipa (a Warner artist) instead.
The greatest power, though, may reside with Universal's artists, especially those who have new music to hype; if they feel that the conflict is starting to hurt them more than a new deal could help, they will make it known.

Full text: Igor Levit's response to tragedy, Ethan Iverson's first piano sonata and a personal recording by Gidon Kremer are among the highlights.
'Lieder Ohne Worte'
Igor Levit, piano (Sony)
Music doesn't have the power to end wars. Peace, said Daniel Barenboim, whose West-Eastern Divan Orchestra brings together Israeli and Palestinian artists, "needs something else."
But that doesn't mean musicians are powerless. On this album, recorded and released with white-heat urgency following the latest conflict in Israel and Gaza, Igor Levit documents a personal reaction while using his platform as a star pianist to support two organizations against antisemitism that are based in Berlin, where he lives.
In the past, Levit has been accused of opportunistic political posturing, but his philanthropic projects have been virtually apolitical -- and too substantial to dismiss. Early in the pandemic, he spun his "house concert" livestreams into a marathon of Satie's "Vexations" that raised money for artist relief. And this album's proceeds will go directly to the Berlin organizations.
Levit wanted to record selections from Mendelssohn's "Lieder Ohne Worte," or "Songs Without Words," because, he has said, "there is a certain melancholy about them which really helped me a bit." That doleful mood pervades these interpretations: a sadly beautiful tone; an emotional climax that evaporates rather than reaching a resolution; a heartbreakingly simple plunk of high keys.
Just as emotionally communicative is the cover art, a gray-scale photograph of Levit's hand holding his Star of David necklace. The background is black -- a void that emphasizes absence, the "without" of the music's title, and loss. This image doesn't necessarily pick sides in the war, but instead mourns its fundamental tragedy. JOSHUA BARONE
Ethan Iverson: 'Technically Acceptable'
Ethan Iverson, piano; Thomas Morgan and Simón Willson, basses; Kush Abadey and Vinnie Sperrazza, percussion; Rob Schwimmer, theremin (Blue Note)
One of the marketing hooks for this pianist and composer's latest release is that it contains the first piano sonata ever released on the storied jazz label Blue Note. Anyone in the mood for tuneful and ambitious formal composition should proceed directly to the end of this album.
The sonata, Ethan Iverson's first, reflects his diverse lodestars. Classical in conception -- right down to a repeat of the exposition material in the opening movement -- it also contains traces of crunchy harmonic modernism and the bumptious sounds of vintage American jazz styles. The protean first movement dictates that some syncopated figures should sound in the manner of the Harlem stride master James P. Johnson; the lyrical middle movement sports bluesy licks, marked forte, that Iverson likens to the style of Bobby Timmons. (To savor the notation, check out the score-scrolling videos that Blue Note has uploaded to YouTube. While you're there, check out the balance of the album, which features sterling jazz-trio work, not to mention a theremin solo on "'Round Midnight.")
In an interview last year, Iverson said: "I feel James P. with me; I feel Erroll Garner with me. And I feel Ralph Shapey." That final name-drop -- of a maverick American composer -- is another useful reference point. While the risk in a piece like Iverson's sonata usually involves accusations of pastiche, he steers well clear of that trap, thanks to a rigorous engagement with his chosen inspirations. The result, performed by him on this recording, is a work both high spirited and sturdy. I await his second effort in this vein. SETH COLTER WALLS
'Songs of Fate'
Gidon Kremer, violin; Vida Mikneviciute, soprano; Kremerata Baltica (ECM New Series)
Several years ago, Gidon Kremer told The New York Times that his roots go "deep in many directions." This moving if elusive new album plays like a nod to all, or at least to several, of them. There is the notion of Jewishness, something that the Latvian-born violinist was surprised by, according to his liner note. The album also reflects his Baltic heritage, with music by three composers hardly known outside the region: Raminta Serksnyte, Giedrius Kuprevicius, both Lithuanian, and Jekabs Jancevskis, who is Latvian. The inclusion of Mieczyslaw Weinberg speaks to his ardent championing of that Polish-born composer.
Hovering over everything, to my ears, is a starkly despondent tone that marks this project as being haunted by the ongoing horrors in Ukraine, something that would be fitting for a musician unafraid of linking art and politics.
One thing is certain: This is one of Kremer's most personal undertakings. His playing -- especially in Serksnyte's "This Too Shall Pass" and Weinberg's simple, sad "Nocturne" -- has the breath and rhythm of halting speech. Soprano Vida Mikneviciute imparts a similar tone to Kuprevicius's "Kaddish" and to excerpts from Weinberg's "Jewish Songs." Jancevskis's "Lignum" for string orchestra and chimes, played with deep sensitivity by the chamber orchestra Kremerata Baltica, progresses from dissonance to resounding affirmation to an open-ended conclusion. It sounds like Kremer's description of the album's purpose: "reminding us of tragic fates along the way and that we each have a 'voice' that deserves to be heard." DAVID WEININGER
'Éventail'
Heinz Holliger, oboe and oboe d'amore; Anton Kernjak, piano; Alice Belugou, harp (ECM New Series)
There's a dreamy, wistful quality to this album of French music from the oboist Heinz Holliger. At 84, his tone is less sweet and bright than it is mysterious and sinuous, amber-colored, with occasional passing clouds. His phrasing is sensitive, as in the romance at the center of the middle movement of Saint-Saëns's late sonata; this take on that sonata's finale is more easygoing and lyrical than some other accounts. The pianist Anton Kernjak is an eloquent partner, here and elsewhere on the recording.
Holliger makes some intriguing choices. He plays Charles Koechlin's pastoral "Le Repos de Tityre," written for the mellow oboe d'amore, and then also uses that instrument for two works by Debussy: the plaintive "Syrinx" (originally for flute) and the "Petite Pièce" (clarinet). Adaptations to oboe abound, including from wordless vocalises by Ravel, Messiaen and Saint-Saëns. Robert Casadesus's sonata -- by turns quietly noble, cheerful and elegantly driving -- receives a rare, pleasant performance.
It is all lovely, if a bit monochromatic. The highlight is André Jolivet's shrouded, skittish "Controversia," from 1968, which was dedicated to Holliger and the harpist Ursula Holliger, his wife. On the album, the harp part is taken up by Alice Belugou, who interacts with Holliger to impressively eerie effect. ZACHARY WOOLFE
Puccini: 'I Canti'
Charles Castronovo, tenor; Munich Radio Orchestra; Ivan Repušić, conductor (BR Klassik)
All but two of Puccini's operas are repertory staples. There isn't a lot of vocal music left to unearth from the well-loved composer of big, heart-on-your-sleeve melodies. So this album of Puccini songs, presented in new orchestrations by Johannes X. Schachtner, feels like stumbling upon a trove of undiscovered arias -- a minor trove, but a trove nevertheless. And some of the material was in fact recently rediscovered.
The songs' original piano parts, pro forma in the extreme, sound like a piano-vocal reduction of an opera score. Schachtner fills in the instrumental colors -- obbligato winds, vocal doublings, radiant strings -- that might have swirled in Puccini's mind. If Schachtner's orchestrations lack the confident stroke of the master's pen, they remain a pleasing simulacrum of his flamboyantly emotional style.
Robust, with only a touch of dryness in his tone, the tenor Charles Castronovo sings these songs as though they're proto-arias. And in some cases they are: Puccini, an inveterate self-borrower, repurposed melodies for his operas, and Castronovo's broad, stirring phrases, gregarious outbursts and linguistic relish bring to mind those reckless romantics Rodolfo, Ruggero and des Grieux.
This year is the centennial of Puccini's death, and Angela Gheorghiu is releasing her own recording of this repertoire on the Signum Classics label. Overmilked phrases and wayward pitch aside, the Romanian soprano's voice retains glints of its delicate, kaleidoscopic colors and a sense of interiority.
Whether these are art songs or arias in disguise, both singers express their character with an ardor that is unmistakably Puccinian. OUSSAMA ZAHR

Full text: The filmmakers DK and Hugh Welchman apply a painstaking oil painting technique to render this sweeping drama set in a 19th century Polish village.
The painstaking process behind "The Peasants," the new painted film exercise from DK and Hugh Welchman, is only laid out after the film ends. As the credits roll, the directors show clips of painters viewing reference footage and then reproducing the images in oil on canvas, sometimes frame by frame.
The filmmakers pioneered the inventive animation technique on their previous feature, the Oscar-nominated "Loving Vincent," and they apply it here to a story of sweeping scale. Based on Wladyslaw Reymont's novel, "The Peasants" follows Jagna (Kamila Urzedowska), a young woman in 19th century Poland who is driven into a loveless marriage with a wealthy widower (Miroslaw Baka) despite her ongoing flirtation with his strapping son, Antek (Robert Gulaczyk).
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The world of the film is insular and provincial, stacked with themes of family and faith and peopled with vulnerable girls, resentful wives and brooding men quick to trade punches over perceived affronts to their pride or dignity.
"The Peasants" is divided into four seasons, and its inventive visual style proves richest when rendering landscapes -- scenery that shifts in color and stroke with the climate. But as the story's melodrama grows repetitive, so do the visuals. The painted animation is especially deficient in close-up shots (of which there are many); the smudgy brushstrokes blunt facial expressions. In these moments, the technique seems to be working against the film's emotion rather than for it.

Rated R for sexual violence and nudity. In Polish, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 54 minutes. In theaters.

Vision Pro: We've Been Here Before: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Starting with Google Glass, all have been plagued with the same issues, even as Apple plunges into the market with its Vision Pro.
After years of anticipation, Apple's first major new product in nearly a decade has arrived. The $ 3,500 Vision Pro, a face computer that resembles ski goggles, will be released next week.
So, what can we expect?
The device, which includes high-resolution displays and sensors that track eye movements and hand gestures, is one of Apple's most ambitious products. It bills the headset as the beginning of an era of "spatial computing," which blends data with the physical world to make our lives better. Imagine giving a presentation with digital notes shown in the corner of your eye, for example.
I was among the first group of journalists to try the Vision Pro last year and walked away impressed with the quality of the picture but ultimately not sure that people would want to wear it. My skepticism was colored by my experience wearing more than a dozen headsets in the last 12 years from companies like Google, Meta, Snap, Samsung and Sony, including virtual reality goggles that plugged into bulky desktop computers and smart glasses that shot photos. The devices were intended to create immersive experiences for getting things done by moving the body instead of typing on keyboards.
Broadly speaking, the problem with headsets has less to do with technology and more to do with behavior: People quickly get tired of wearing a computer on their face, the devices end up in closets, and software developers lose interest in making apps. Sales of mixed reality and virtual reality headsets fell 8.3 percent last year, according to the research firm IDC, though they may rebound this year with Apple entering the market.
Even though Apple has a reputation for being late to the party with superior products, as it was with music players and smartphones, the Vision Pro is not guaranteed to be a breakthrough hit, especially with its breathtaking price.
"Is this Apple entering a market late but coming in with the best product and therefore will be successful?" asked Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst and former Apple marketing director. "Or is there not an existing market because there are no $ 3,500 headsets aimed for the mass market?"
To better understand how an Apple face computer may (or may not) fit into our lives in the future, it's worth taking this moment to look back at the many face computers I've worn that set the scene for the Vision Pro.
Smart glasses
In 2012, Google unveiled a mixed-reality headset, Google Glass. It was essentially a headband with a camera and a monocle, positioned above your right eye, that contained a transparent display showing calendar and maps software. To demonstrate its exciting potential, Google produced a video of people wearing the face computer while leaping out of an airplane.
When I tried an early prototype of Google Glass that year, the only working feature was a maps app that showed directions as I walked around a path. This could be useful, in theory, to keep my eyes on the road while driving or bicycling, but at a significant cost: I looked like a "Star Trek" character.
Sure enough, after Google Glass made its public debut, pandemonium ensued. A blogger in San Francisco was assaulted for wearing one. Memes emerged, including the term "Glasshole" for anyone who could potentially be recording video of people without their permission. Google eventually marketed the monocle as a business device, but finally killed the product in 2023.
After Google Glass flopped, the tech industry regrouped and tried to address the design and privacy issues. In 2016 and 2021, Snap and Meta released stylish glasses with cameras and tiny lights that indicated when a user was recording. Both products were unpopular. I recently tested the second-generation Meta glasses and concluded that while they looked satisfyingly hip, the privacy concerns remained because no one noticed when I was taking pictures of them.
Smartphone-powered virtual reality
The tech industry was also eager to sell people on a different type of headset for virtual reality. The headsets, which looked like plastic goggles, blocked out your view of the outside world to immerse yourself in a 3-D digital environment and experience something as if you were actually there -- by moving your head around to look at the Grand Canyon, for example.
To make virtual reality headsets an easier sell, tech companies like Google and Samsung tried relying on smartphones for their screens and computing power. In 2015, Samsung collaborated with the virtual reality company Oculus to design Gear VR, a headset into which the user could insert a smartphone to look at virtual reality content. In 2016, Google released Daydream VR, a similar product for Android phones.
While the products lowered the cost for people to try VR, I ran into problems with them. The smartphones running VR software became very hot, their batteries drained rapidly and the applications were gimmicky -- one simulation I tried involved staring at a virtual dinosaur. Google killed Daydream VR in 2019, and Samsung announced the end of its VR content services in 2020.
Plugged-in VR
In 2016, Oculus, which Meta had acquired for $ 2 billion two years earlier, released the Oculus Rift, a high-end VR system that plugged into a powerful desktop computer. The full bundle, which included the headset, a game controller and a computer, cost $ 1,500. With 30 games at launch, the product was marketed as a next-generation gaming device.
Virtual reality games were designed to let you move around as if you were inside the game. A shooting game could involve looking for guns and bending over and using motion controllers to pick them up and fire them at opponents.
Other similar products followed, including Sony's $ 400 PlayStation VR, a headset that plugged into PlayStation consoles. For years, the PlayStation headset dominated the high-powered virtual reality space because it lowered costs by eliminating the need to buy a separate computer. The second-generation PlayStation headset came out last year.
Nonetheless, a Sony executive recently called virtual reality a "challenging category" because VR had not changed much for the games industry. Most people still prefer to play video games on a television.
In my experience testing all of these products over the years, they shared the same flaws: The headsets felt heavy, the hardware and wires created clutter in a living room, and there weren't many compelling games to play.
Stand-alone headsets and mixed reality
Stand-alone headsets, which cram the computer, display and sensor technologies into one product, have become the most convenient VR products to date. Since 2019, Meta's Quest headsets, which range from $ 250 to $ 1,000, have used this approach, but the products are still not mainstream hits.
Last year, Meta released the $ 500 Quest 3, its first consumer headset with a focus on mixed reality, which uses cameras to see into the real world while using the headset. When firing a gun inside a shooting game, you can take cover behind the couch in your living room, for example. In my tests, I concluded that while the graphics had greatly improved, the headset felt too heavy on my neck after about 15 minutes. I also felt unimpressed with the games and the device's short battery life of two hours.
This brings us all to the product in question: the Vision Pro, which Apple is marketing as a productivity tool to replace your laptop with a virtual screen and digital keyboard, a 3-D movie player and a gaming device.
At 21 ounces, the Vision Pro is just as heavy as Meta's products, and my eyes and neck felt similarly fatigued after I wore it for half an hour.
The Apple headset's battery, a separate brick that connects to the goggles via a wire, delivers two hours of life like Meta's -- not enough to finish most feature-length movies, let alone get much work done.
As for games, no major game studio has yet announced any made specifically for the Vision Pro. The headset does include an app for looking at a 3-D dinosaur, though.

Memes and Goofiness Expand the Reach of a Japanese Franchise: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Like a Dragon role-playing games follow a gangster through facsimiles of Japanese cities. With earnest goofiness, they've found an international audience.
It all started with a chicken named Nugget.
For about a decade, American audiences had largely overlooked the Yakuza role-playing games that follow the exploits of Kazuma Kiryu, a gangster with a heart of gold, and a sprawling cast of characters through facsimiles of Japanese cities.
When the first Yakuza came to the United States in 2006, it was marketed as something like a Japanese Grand Theft Auto, leaning heavily on a gritty crime story and a celebrity voice cast. But it took until 2015, when the prequel Yakuza 0 was released, for the franchise's earnest goofiness -- the games unexpectedly switch between simulation, melodrama, satire and parody -- to break through in America.
One of the many side activities in Yakuza 0, which is set in the boom of '80s Tokyo, is a real estate management simulator in which Kiryu assigns employees to businesses based on their skills. After a GIF of Nugget working as a business manager went viral, the game became a word-of-mouth hit in the United States, drawing in new players and spurring interest in previous titles.
Since then, Sega has remade or remastered several of the franchise's games to run on modern hardware. The series dropped the Yakuza name last year, and new games are now released simultaneously worldwide. When its ninth main entry, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, is released on Friday, Kiryu will venture outside Japan for the first time on an adventure in Hawaii.
"I think that Sega is smelling blood here," said Serkan Toto, a video game industry consultant in Tokyo.
The Like a Dragon series has now sold more than 21 million copies. Its glut of content, severe tonal shifts and aversion to subtlety -- players fight a giant shark in Infinite Wealth -- make it a potent source of memes in an online ecosystem that rewards video clips presented without context. Access to the games has also expanded beyond the Sony PlayStation, with most available on the PC and Xbox via the Microsoft subscription service Game Pass.
But the increased interest might also have something to do with a gaping hole in the video game industry.
It has been more than a decade since Grand Theft Auto V was released, and fans of open-world games with cinematic narratives -- in which players find themselves ensnared in a criminal enterprise, exploring detailed cityscapes full of eccentric characters and engrossing minigames -- have had to turn elsewhere. (Grand Theft Auto Online's multiplayer shenanigans have kept many people invested in that franchise, whose next game is scheduled for 2025.)
Those who have discovered Like a Dragon can find its exaggerated portrayal of Japanese urban life an engrossing counterpoint to Grand Theft Auto's jaded, pessimistic parody of America. Grand Theft Auto has an understandable gun fetish, but Like a Dragon's fighting is through hand-to-hand combat, a reflection of Japan's nearly gun-free society.
The aspects of real life that developers include add to the texture of a video game's world. Some studios nab the likeness of global celebrities or reconstruct ancient cities. A trailer for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth featured an expertly rendered store sign for Dean & DeLuca, an upscale grocery chain founded in America.
The invocation of real brands and products, like BOSS Coffee, Yoshinoya ramen and arcade games by Sega, enhances the eccentricities of the long-running series developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. (In Japan, the series has always been called Ryu Ga Gotoku, Japanese for "like a dragon.")
A franchise that began in the barely fictional Tokyo district of Kamurocho, based on Kabukicho, has since expanded to reproductions of Osaka, Okinawa and Onomichi. For Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the studio considered visiting Guam before settling on Yokohama and Honolulu. It is a canny decision that allows the series to go abroad without losing its Japanese specificity.
"A lot of Japanese almost think of Hawaii as the 48th prefecture of Japan," Toto said. "So it's very, very clever of Sega."
Hiroyuki Sakamoto, the producer of Infinite Wealth, said the team conducted interviews and research in Honolulu to build the virtual city, one that features Hawaii-specific retailers like ABC Stores, Hilo Hattie and 88 Tees. But anything that does not suit the team's vision can be changed. The real Honolulu, as far as anyone is aware, does not feature a derelict "District 9"-like crime hub or an underground shopping mall for upscale black-market goods.
Players who have in recent years caught up with the Like a Dragon catalog have entered a universe where melodrama abounds as Kiryu navigates familial bonds, revenge plots and intricate political and financial schemes.
Consistently, to the point of comedy, Kiryu and his opponent dramatically throw off their shirts to reveal full back tattoos before a cinematic fistfight. When it is time for conflict in Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, where Kiryu is forced to explore a city while toting around a baby, he gently passes the infant to a passerby before wailing on hoodlums. All of these flourishes are done with an admirable straight face.
The expansive roster of available side activities -- running errands for store owners, practicing street photography, hunting in the wilderness, go-kart racing, exercising -- can also lean into the bizarre. In one minigame, the player must stay awake during a movie to avoid offending a companion. Infinite Wealth features Sicko Snap, a parody of the video game Pokémon Snap in which the player must give hip-gyrating pests the paparazzi treatment.
The Yakuza 0 meme of Nugget "saved the series," said a longtime fan who streams speedruns on Twitch under the name Froob. Social media was a large part of the gaming discourse at the time, helping to introduce the franchise to new fans. "They suddenly started thinking, 'Oh, this series has a really funny side to it,' which anyone who's played the games already knew," he said.
One perennial highlight for Like a Dragon fans is karaoke, where players tap along to songs during segments produced in the cheesy style of lyric videos. Even spinoffs set in feudal Japan or an alternate reality infested with zombies contain a version of the mode.
Another thrill is discovering gradual change to familiar places over time. Although the anchor hub of Kamurocho has remained present since the beginning of the series, its street layout unchanged, subsequent games offer fresh city districts to explore.
A derelict park used by the unhoused early in the series becomes a luxury development. The Millennium Tower -- a skyscraper that serves as a Mount Doom-type finish line for the climax of nearly every game -- is just a construction site in Yakuza 0. Phone booths that once served as save points have vanished; now an in-game smartphone lets players save their progress from anywhere.
Ryu Ga Gotoku experimented with enlarging Kamurocho's land mass for Yakuza 4 but determined that "just making it bigger isn't that interesting," said Masayoshi Yokoyama, the studio head and longtime series producer. The games have instead expanded vertically, revealing rooftops or new underground areas like sewers, allowing the cityscape to be at once familiar and surprising. Doors that were once flat textures open to reveal new haunts.
As Kiryu's story progresses, the list of names and faces to keep track of has also grown -- there are grizzled detectives, corrupt politicians, sleazy thugs, scrappy hustlers and distressed hostesses. Yakuza 5, the most wide-ranging installment, features four other playable characters, including a bruiser who has recently escaped from prison and Kiryu's adopted daughter, Haruka, an aspiring pop idol.
In Yakuza: Like a Dragon, the series demoted the stoic Kiryu to a supporting role and introduced a new protagonist, the annoyingly optimistic, puppylike Ichiban Kasuga. (The pair shares top billing in Infinite Wealth.)
It also switched from a real-time combat system to a turn-based one more likely to be found in a role-playing game, complete with homages to Square Enix's Dragon Quest series. Instead of summoning mythical creatures for powerful attacks, the character known as Ichiban can use his smartphone to reach regular dudes for help. An adult baby in a diaper whom he befriends will cry when called, which lowers the defense stats of all enemies.
The tale of the Like a Dragon series is so expansive that much of Infinite Wealth is devoted to reminiscing on Kiryu's past adventures. He has been diagnosed with cancer and is working on his bucket list, visiting the sites of pivotal scenes from the series.
For Yokoyama and Sakamoto, who have worked on the games for 19 years, this development also allowed them to look back on their own work.
"We really felt that Kiryu had a very, very good life," they said.

Aiming to Diversify, Sunoco to Buy NuStar
Sunoco said on Monday that it would acquire fuels storage and pipeline operator NuStar Energy in a deal valued at about $ 7.3 billion including debt, as it tries to diversify its core business beyond distribution of motor fuels.
The equity portion of the deal comes up to $ 2.99 billion, and NuStar's shareholders stand to receive 0.400 of a Sunoco share for each NuStar unit they hold, valuing Sunoco's shares at $ 23.78. That represents a premium of 31.9 percent to NuStar's last closing price.
"Having the fuel distribution business helps keep your midstream assets full, and often these assets provide a foundation for additional growth and supply synergies," Sunoco executives said in a call.
The deal, which has been approved by both boards, will give Sunoco access to NuStar's transportation and storage facilities, including about 9,500 miles of pipeline and 63 terminals. REUTERS
MERGERS
Sony Won't Merge
Indian Unit With Zee
Sony Group scrapped plans on Monday for a $ 10 billion merger of its Indian unit with Zee Entertainment, ending a deal that could have created one of the South Asian nation's biggest TV broadcasters.
The collapse of the deal in content-hungry India creates more uncertainty for the TV broadcaster Zee in particular as competition heats up, with Disney also seeking to merge its Indian businesses with the media assets of the billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance.
Zee told Indian stock exchanges that Sony was seeking $ 90 million in termination fees for alleged breaches of their merger agreement and emergency interim relief by "invoking arbitration."
Sony said in a statement certain "closing conditions" to the merger were not satisfied despite "good faith discussions" with Zee. REUTERS
LABOR
Southwest Pilots Ratify
A Big Boost in Pay
Pilots at Southwest Airlines have overwhelmingly approved a new contract that will raise their pay rates by nearly 50 percent by 2028, becoming the last group of pilots at the nation's four biggest airlines to score huge raises.
The Southwest Airlines Pilots Association said Monday that the agreement covering pay and other issues for about 11,000 pilots was ratified by a 93 percent to 7 percent margin.
Airline labor groups, and pilots in particular, have succeeded in negotiating pay raises over the last year as most carriers returned to solid profitability after the pandemic. Pilots have been helped by a shortage, particularly at smaller carriers that act as training grounds for American, Delta, United and Southwest.
The contract calls for an immediate 29.15 percent increase upon ratification, followed by 4 percent raises in 2025, 2026, and 2027 and a 3.25 percent increase in 2028. ASSOCIATED PRESS

A Futuristic Tokyo Building's Legacy Lives On: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Fifty years ago, the Nakagin Capsule Tower was hailed as a marvel of organic architecture. Now its legacy lives on through 23 orphaned capsules.
In 1972, residents of Tokyo looked up to see something extraordinary looming over downtown. It looked like something out of a science-fiction film -- a futuristic tower composed of 140 detachable capsules, each suitable for a single resident and with a porthole looking out, like a pile of eyes fixed on the city.
With its modular design and minimal aesthetics, the 13-story Nakagin Capsule Tower was a marvel of 20th-century design intended to express a postwar Japanese theory of architecture as a living organism. Metabolism, as explained by the architect Kisho Kurokawa, who designed the tower, envisioned cities and buildings with modular parts that could be attached and detached as needed, just as some organisms grow new appendages.
"If you replace the capsules every 25 years, it could last 200 years," Kurokawa said in an interview in 2007, the year he died. "It's recyclable. I designed it as sustainable architecture."
Each capsule measured eight by 13 feet and was affixed to one of two central towers of reinforced concrete. But over the years, many of them were abandoned and left to decay, and residents finally decided to let the building die rather than save it. Lamenting its fate, The New York Times called the Nakagin tower "an architectural tragedy."
After years of delays, the Nakagin Capsule Tower was dismantled in late 2022, its 140 prefabricated capsules plucked from their sockets one by one and discarded. Most were unsalvageable. But 23 pods managed to survive -- pieces with no puzzle.
Now, after some refurbishment, these orphan capsules are embarking on a surprising second life, pollinating new architectural ideas across Japan and the world, where they're being repurposed into art spaces, museum pieces and even holiday accommodations.
"Even though we couldn't save the building, Kisho Kurokawa's original idea of capsules as interchangeable, mobile elements gave us the impetus to preserve them," said Tatsuyuki Maeda, a former Nakagin resident and now the head of the Nakagin Capsule Tower Building Preservation and Regeneration Project.
Mr. Maeda, 56, fell in love with the tower when he first saw it as a boy, imagining it to be a base for the superhero of Japan's "Ultraman" science-fiction franchise. "I felt drawn to its unique exterior," he said. "I wanted to look out through one of those round windows someday."
Since the demolition, Mr. Maeda has fielded requests from wealthy people to buy the pods, but they're not for sale. Putting these Metabolist castaways in the care of museums and commercial facilities was the best solution.
"The concept was that when a capsule became old, it would be replaced with a new one," he said. "This meant that the capsule itself could be moved. By exhibiting capsules around the world, I want as many people as possible to understand this concept."
All 23 have been reborn -- their asbestos removed, their insides and outsides repaired and repainted, and in some cases new furnishings installed. Now they're finding a new purpose as messengers from a bygone design era. An Osaka steel company placed one on a trailer undercarriage and has been displaying it at trade shows in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka to promote its design brand. Another capsule was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, Wakayama, which Kurokawa's studio designed in 1990. Kurokawa's own capsule found its way to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
"It is hard to find Metabolist drawings available, so when we heard that the Nakagin Tower residents were unsuccessful in their bid to restore the towers and it was going to be demolished, we decided to go and see the demolition and the saved towers to begin a conversation," said Jennifer Dunlop Fletcher, the Helen Hilton Raiser Curator of Architecture and Design at SFMOMA.
Erected on the edge of the upscale Ginza district, Kurokawa's capsule tower reimagined minimal modern living. Each capsule was just large enough for a bed, closet, workstation, bathroom and a porthole window. Deluxe versions came with a built-in Sony stereo, tape deck, color TV and digital clock.
At first, the pods were aimed at busy salarymen looking for a pied-à-terre downtown rather than a long commute. "This 'capsule' will provide a good living space and a secluded environment in which to select and evaluate business data," proclaimed an early sales brochure, advertising features like housekeepers, typewriters and calculators.
And more than just a convenient place to stay, Nakagin was a living art installation -- an expression of the postwar Japanese philosophy mixing modern architecture with organic biological growth.
The Metabolist movement, said Ms. Fletcher, "emphasized proof of concept, light environmental footprint and an early interest in biotechnology."
But like many living bodies, Kurokawa's tower encountered unexpected maladies.
Upon its completion in 1972, all the units were sold and the building basked in critical acclaim. But second-generation owners who had inherited capsules weren't as interested in using them, much less in paying for replacements when the steel shells began to deteriorate. The capsules had to be removed for renewal, which was prohibitively expensive. Asbestos was another major problem. As the decades passed, many units became corroded, and netting was placed over the structure to prevent pieces from crashing to the street below. Units were left vacant or used for storage.
In 2018, a real estate company purchased the land, along with some of the capsules, with plans for redevelopment. But the pandemic infected those plans. Since the tower was now certain to be knocked down, preservationists agreed to pay part of the demolition cost to the real estate company in exchange for the transfer of the 23 capsules free of charge.
Despite its premature demise, the tower had become an icon of Tokyo, attracting design enthusiasts from around the world. Even though most owners decided to sell, Nakagin had developed a small community of residents. In place of the salarymen of old, it drew writers, architects, photographers and other creatives. They held drinking parties, hosted famous visitors (among them Francis Ford Coppola and Keanu Reeves) and dreamed of saving the structure from the proverbial wrecking ball.
Takayuki Sekine bought two capsules in 2005 while he was a manager at a regional chamber of commerce. He spent weekends there for the next 15 years, always welcoming curious visitors.
"Everyone was very happy and enjoyed the unique space, with many saying it was their favorite building in the world," said Mr. Sekine, 61.
Shojiro Okuyama, 46, a journalist, bought a unit in 2016 in a bid to help save the building.
"We had the preservation project going at the time, but even so it was heartbreaking to see my own capsule being scrapped," he said. "I was first drawn to it because of the architecture, but it was the community that I came to really love. I hope the preserved capsules can spread that sense of community across borders."
Refurbished capsules are now drawing fans in Ginza, Tokyo's upscale shopping and nightlife district. The entertainment company Shochiku, known for its Kabuki theater, has put two on permanent display. At a recent gathering in its purpose-built gallery, Wakana Nitta, a musician who goes by the name Cosplay DJ Koe-chan, set up her turntables between the pods and began spinning tunes from anime shows and sci-fi films.
A former resident, Ms. Nitta, now 44, meticulously documented the tower's dismantling. At the recent event, her photos of cranes carrying capsules out of the structure were on display in a capsule that had been stripped down to its frame; the other, refurbished, displayed images of her life in her own pod, gazing out its porthole at Tokyo.
"It felt like aliens had taken me aboard a spaceship," she laughed. "With the cranes lifting them, the capsules finally flew through the sky like UFOs."
The Nakagin tower also lives on digitally. The architecture and design firm Gluon took more than 20,000 photos with drones and single-lens reflex cameras to record the entire building with civil-engineering laser scanners. The result is a precise 3-D rendering of the structure, rust stains and all, which has been uploaded to the internet for posterity.
For those who want to experience the real thing, Mr. Maeda and his colleagues plan to open a seaside "capsule village" in Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, this year. Five refurbished Nakagin units will be set up along the coast, their portholes pointed toward the Pacific. The idea was inspired by a 1972 Kurokawa scheme outlined in a book that is on display at the only other place where you can sleep in one of his original pods: Capsule House K, the architect's own former cottage in the hills of Nagano Prefecture west of Tokyo. Now a $ 1,400-a-night Airbnb rental, it comprises four capsules, made at the same time as those for the Nakagin tower, attached to a concrete core. Two are identical to the Nakagin units, one is a kitchen, and one is a chashitsu, or traditional Japanese tearoom.
"He grew up in Aichi with a backyard tearoom where he and his siblings did their studies and played hide and seek," said Kurokawa's son, Mikio Kurokawa, 58, while showing a visitor the capsule on a recent afternoon. "It's said that a room this size allows Japanese to feel most relaxed."
Back in Tokyo, the Ginza Six shopping mall has unveiled another Nakagin homage: a mock-up of the Nakagin tower erected on a rooftop skating rink, with a capsule refurbished as a retro music room set up at a street-level entrance.
"How do the people of today, who live in the future, feel about the 'future ideas of the 1970s' that the Nakagin building held, and how will they connect these ideas to our own future?" asked Yoshiro Nishi, a spokesman for YAR, a design studio that did the interior. "We'll be happy if this exhibition can serve as a bridge from the past to the present and further into the future."
Thus far, 16 of the 23 rescued capsules have found new homes. As for Nakagin's legacy, it lives on in a variety of buildings: Kurokawa created the first capsule hotel, the Capsule Inn Osaka, which opened in 1979. Its units, stacked in twos, were only the width of a single mattress, but the concept was adopted in cities throughout Japan and even exported. It was an early example of how modular architecture, now seen in everything from residences to airports, can inspire.
"Under the Metabolism concept, the tower would remain and the capsules would be discarded like old cells," said Mikio Kurokawa. "The fact that due to the strong feelings of many people, some capsules have survived and been restored as new cells for new locations is perhaps even more interesting than Metabolism itself. Their architect would have been delighted."

Full text: The Vision Pro augmented reality device goes on sale Friday. Don't expect Apple to host a splashy event to promote it.
When Apple released the Apple Watch in 2015, it was business as usual for a company whose iPhone updates had become cultural touchstones. Before the watch went on sale, Apple gave early versions of it to celebrities like Beyoncé, featured it in fashion publications like Vogue and streamed a splashy event on the internet trumpeting its features.
But as Apple prepared to sell its next generation of wearable computing, the Vision Pro augmented reality device, it marched far more quietly into the consumer marketplace.
The company said in a news release this month that sales of the device would begin Friday. No big product event was scheduled, though Apple has created a catchy commercial about the device and offered individual demonstrations of it to tech reviewers. And in a departure for the secretive company, the Vision Pro has been tested with more developers than past Apple products were to see what they like and don't like about it.
The toning down of marketing tactics speaks to the challenges facing Apple, a company that has grown so large over the years that new product lines that could one day be worth billions are still a sliver of iPhone sales, which topped $ 200 billion last year.
Apple's low-key approach to the Vision Pro also speaks to the challenges associated with selling a device that could still be years away from appealing to mainstream consumers. In addition to explaining what the Vision Pro can do -- as it does with every new device -- Apple must overcome its high price of $ 3,500, as well as muted interest in augmented reality gadgets that blend the digital and physical worlds. Another challenge: The three-dimensional experience provided by the device can really be understood only through demonstrations.
Apple's solution is to take it slow and seed interest with developers who may build apps that work with the Vision Pro. The company is expected to pitch the device to more mainstream customers after it has lowered the price and improved the technology.
Analysts expect Apple to sell about 400,000 units of the Vision Pro this year. By contrast, the company sold an estimated 12 million Apple Watches in 2015, analysts said.
"Apple knows that this product is not ready for the masses," said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, a tech investment and research firm. "For them to put a big splash out would be off the mark."
Apple declined to comment.
The Vision Pro has been nearly a decade in the making and cost billions of dollars to develop. The device, which looks like ski goggles, uses cameras and sensors to track people's eyes and hand movements as they interact on the headset's display with three-dimensional digital objects like apps and computer screens. It can also record three-dimensional video and play films on screens that look as big as those in a movie theater.
"It's the first Apple product you look through and not at," Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, said in June during the product's introduction.
But augmented reality devices have struggled to catch on with consumers. Last year, the tech industry sold 8.1 million augmented reality headsets, an 8.3 percent decrease from the previous year, according to IDC, a market research firm. Since jumping into the market in 2014, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has been selling Oculus and Quest headsets for video games and virtual meetings. Sony, Microsoft and Varjo, a Finnish company, also have augmented reality devices.
Apple has tried to set its device apart from competitors that have described their products as gateways to the metaverse. Rather than use that term, which Neal Stephenson coined in the 1992 novel "Snow Crash," Apple has called its augmented reality experience "spatial computing."
In its headset guidelines, Apple asked developers not to refer to the apps that they create as virtual reality or augmented reality products but as spatial computing apps.
"They're maintaining complete control," said Grant Anderson, the chief executive of Mirrorscape, the maker of an augmented reality app for tabletop games.
Since the June unveiling, Apple has courted developers it hopes will build apps for the device. It created test labs around the world where developers could try the product.
In August, Cristian Díaz, an engineer at Monstarlab, went to a Vision Pro lab in Munich. After stepping through a secret door marked with an Apple logo, he joined several other developers who were each fitted with a headset and given six hours to test their apps and write code in the system.
Mr. Díaz said Apple's engineers had asked the developers for feedback on the device, including on how the software and development tools worked. They took notes. When Mr. Díaz returned for a second lab experience in London in September, he said, it was clear that Apple had made improvements based on the feedback.
Among the changes, Apple made it possible for its engineers to watch what developers were doing inside the headsets by connecting to them with Apple's wireless communication tool, AirPlay, Mr. Díaz said. That allowed the engineers to assist developers in solving problems as they worked on their apps.
"We were like animals in a lab," said Mr. Díaz, who called the Vision Pro "a great experience."
The approach was something of a departure for Apple. Under its co-founder Steve Jobs, the company largely avoided doing focus groups for its products because he believed that Apple's job was to figure out what customers wanted before they knew it.
Mr. Cook has been more open to seeking feedback, said Phillip Shoemaker, who worked at Apple for seven years, leading its App Store. Under both Mr. Jobs and Mr. Cook, Apple tested its iPad and Watch products with select developers in Cupertino, Calif. But with the Vision Pro, the company took an unreleased product to developers overseas for the first time.
"Of all products to do that with, a headset makes sense because a headset is fickle," said Mr. Shoemaker, the executive director of Identity.com, an identity-verification nonprofit. "They don't fit everyone well."
In addition to courting developers, Apple has worked with entertainment companies to outfit the Vision Pro with TV shows, movies, music and sports. Disney has made it possible to watch films from a theater in its streaming app on the device, and Alicia Keys recorded an intimate performance in an immersive, three-dimensional video.
Content experiences will be key to broadening the device's appeal, said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies. Because headsets close people off from the world, she said, Apple will have to give people reasons to spend time in one.
To raise consumer interest, Apple has been running a commercial on national television. The spot shows clips from famous films of people donning headsets, including Luke Skywalker of "Star Wars" and Doc Brown of "Back to the Future." It culminates with a woman pulling on a Vision Pro.
The ad is a reminder of the original iPhone commercial that showed TV and movie clips of people answering the phone, like Lucille Ball in "I Love Lucy."
Apple has been running the Vision Pro ad during National Football League games, according to iSpot.tv, which measures ad spending. Apple spent $ 6.4 million on the spot during the second week of January. By comparison, it spent $ 9.3 million on an iPhone ad in the first week after the release of the iPhone 15 last September.
"Is it a product that will be ubiquitous? No," Ms. Milanesi said. "It's going to be a product that takes time."

Among the changes, Apple made it possible for its engineers to watch what developers were doing inside the headsets by connecting to them with Apple’s wireless communication tool, AirPlay, Díaz said. That allowed the engineers to assist developers in solving problems as they worked on their apps.
“We were like animals in a lab,” said Díaz, who called the Vision Pro “a great experience.”
The approach was something of a departure for Apple. Under its co-founder Steve Jobs, the company largely avoided doing focus groups for its products because he believed that Apple’s job was to figure out what customers wanted before they knew it.
Cook has been more open to seeking feedback, said Phillip Shoemaker, who worked at Apple for seven years, leading its App Store. Under both Jobs and Cook, Apple tested its iPad and Watch products with select developers in Cupertino, California. But with the Vision Pro, the company took an unreleased product to developers overseas for the first time.
“Of all products to do that with, a headset makes sense because a headset is fickle,” said Shoemaker, the executive director of Identity.com, an identity verification nonprofit. “They don’t fit everyone well.”
In addition to courting developers, Apple has worked with entertainment companies to outfit the Vision Pro with TV shows, movies, music and sports. Disney has made it possible to watch films from a theater in its streaming app on the device, and Alicia Keys recorded an intimate performance in an immersive, 3D video.
Content experiences will be key to broadening the device’s appeal, said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies. Because headsets close people off from the world, she said, Apple will have to give people reasons to spend time in one.
To raise consumer interest, Apple has been running a commercial on national television. The spot shows clips from famous films of people donning headsets, including Luke Skywalker of “Star Wars” and Doc Brown of “Back to the Future.” It culminates with a woman pulling on a Vision Pro.
The ad is a reminder of the original iPhone commercial that showed TV and movie clips of people answering the phone, like Lucille Ball in “I Love Lucy.”
Apple has been running a Vision Pro ad during NFL games, according to iSpot.tv, which measures ad spending. Apple spent $6.4 million on the spot during the second week of January. By comparison, it spent $9.3 million on an iPhone ad in the first week after the release of the iPhone 15 last September.
“Is it a product that will be ubiquitous? No,” Milanesi said. “It’s going to be a product that takes time.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: To understand the role of the Broadway orchestrator, seek out the composer Stephen Sondheim's piano demo for the song "Losing My Mind" from the musical "Follies" and then compare it to the version on the original cast recording. The demo's tone is wistful and resigned, with a touch of the whiskey bar about it. In the finished version, the song sounds transformed: Ascending notes on the strings, interjections from the brass and crashing cymbals build to a powerful climax, evoking the heartache and inner turmoil contained in the lyric.
What happened? The short answer: Jonathan Tunick.
"I seem to have a nose for the theater, and it's really like that," Tunick, the prolific Broadway orchestrator, said during an interview in his book-lined study on the Upper West Side. "If something works, you can almost smell it."
Sondheim himself called Tunick the "best orchestrator in the history of the theater" during a 2011 video interview with Sony Masterworks. His work can be heard in three very different Sondheim musicals on New York stages right now: "Sweeney Todd," "Merrily We Roll Along" and Sondheim's posthumous musical, "Here We Are."
In fact, Tunick, 85, has orchestrated nearly every Sondheim musical since 1970, including "Company," "A Little Night Music," "Pacific Overtures," "Into the Woods" and "Passion." For other composers, he orchestrated "A Chorus Line," "Nine," "The Color Purple" and "A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder." An EGOT winner (that rare recipient of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards), Tunick won a Tony for his "Titanic" orchestrations in 1997 (the first year the award was presented) and an Academy Award for the film version of "A Little Night Music." Last fall he became the first orchestrator to have his portrait hung at Sardi's.
At the Sardi's event, at least a couple of guests could be heard wondering aloud: What does a Broadway orchestrator actually do?
Typically, for a Broadway show of the kind Tunick might orchestrate, the composer provides the vocal part along with some form of accompaniment. That accompaniment can be a basic chord sheet, a fully realized piano part or anything in between. It's the orchestrator's task -- a long and lonely one, Tunick said -- to turn that accompaniment into something an orchestra can perform.
There are, of course, more poetic descriptions. In Steven Suskin's book "The Sound of Broadway Music," the original "Carousel" orchestrator, Don Walker, likened orchestration to "the clothing of a musical thought"; Hans Spialek, who orchestrated "On Your Toes" and numerous other Rodgers and Hart shows, compared it to "painting a musical picture."
Tunick's preferred analogy is "lighting for the ears." He often confers with a show's lighting designer to determine which colors and shadings will be used onstage. The orchestra, he said, has the ability "to provide its own shadings of light, darkness, warmth and texture to the music and lyrics."
For the Broadway premiere of "Company" in 1970, Tunick fashioned a crisp, gleaming sound that was the aural equivalent of the chrome-and-glass set by Boris Aronson. Tunick conjured a hellacious soundscape for the macabre "Sweeney Todd": agitated strings, blazing horns and frantic xylophones that evoke the scurrying of rats. For "Merrily We Roll Along," he replicated the bold, brassy up-tempo sound of 1960s Broadway overtures.
Tunick sees to it that the instruments never get in the way of the words. "He is always aware of the lyric and the dramatic moment," said Joel Fram, the music director of the Broadway revival of "Merrily We Roll Along." He pointed to that show's "Our Time" as an example, with its twinkling piano, simple woodwind solos, gentle rhythmic figure on the bassoon and pizzicato cello -- a suitable soundtrack for the youthful optimism of the show's protagonists at that point. "It serves the song rather than overwhelms it."
Charlie Alterman pointed to a favorite orchestration in "Company," for which he serves as the music director of the recent national tour. "It's a bubbling up of emotion somewhere inside the character of Bobby," he said, referring to the moment in the final number, "Being Alive," when, unexpectedly, the melody of "Someone Is Waiting" -- an earlier song filled with a yearning for companionship -- sneaks in like a dawning realization.
"Deep down there's something that remembers the feeling of 'Someone Is Waiting' and wants to be heard," Alterman said. The choice is intriguing on an intellectual level, "but at a gut level, it does that incredible thing that good music does, where you can't quite explain it in your mind, but it's clear as day in your heart."
Tunick remembers sneaking those few notes into "Being Alive" -- and that Sondheim was pleased with the addition. "At least it showed him that I was paying attention," Tunick said.
More than merely making the music sound pretty or palatable, a great orchestrator "is also a playwright, telling the story and reflecting character in orchestral sound," said Michael Starobin, who orchestrated Sondheim's "Sunday in the Park With George" and "Assassins."
As the "Being Alive" example above demonstrates, orchestration "can hint at unspoken secrets," Tunick said. "Things that the characters don't say, or don't want to say, or don't even know."
ONE PIECE OF MUSIC made a big impression on the young Jonathan Tunick: "Tubby the Tuba," the 1945 children's song, centers on a forlorn tuba who longs to play the melody instead of just the bass line. Much like "Peter and the Wolf," the song highlighted the distinct characters of the individual instruments of the orchestra. "This idea penetrated my growing brain," he said. "It developed into a lifelong obsession."
Tunick had some perfunctory piano lessons as a youngster growing up in New York -- "I sailed through the Diller-Quaile book in a week" -- but it was a clarinet, a gift from his amateur clarinetist uncle, that kept his interest.
While a student at what is now Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, he started his own band and played in the school orchestra as well as in the All City High School Orchestra. He started writing music, majoring in composition at Bard College, before paying his way through Juilliard by performing with the school's orchestra.
He was considerably more interested in what was happening at Birdland than on Broadway. "Musicals at the time were a little stodgy," he said. "It was disposable popular entertainment. You'd throw it out like a used Kleenex. I was a little hipper than that."
While in college, a girlfriend introduced him to Frank Sinatra -- and the possibilities of orchestral arrangement. He was struck by the way Nelson Riddle's arrangements on Sinatra's breakup album "In the Wee Small Hours" provided commentary, color and context. "He was tone painting," Tunick said.
College was followed by 10 years of fitful work as an arranger and orchestrator before a big break: orchestrating "Promises, Promises," whose jazz-inflected score by Burt Bacharach brought a refreshingly contemporary sound to Broadway.
Emboldened by that show's success, Tunick called up Sondheim, whose originality and wit as a composer he had admired since hearing "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." Tunick offered Sondheim his services for his next project.
When he first heard the piano renditions of the songs that would become "Company," Tunick was taken aback. With a few exceptions -- "Barcelona" sounds like Erik Satie by way of Brazil, he observed -- the score had a sound entirely of its own. "If anything it was sort of like Stravinsky, but not quite," Tunick said, citing the peculiar melodies and rhythm of "The Little Things You Do Together" as an example of Sondheim's startling originality. "What is that? In every case I had to give it careful thought."
Initially, Tunick wasn't overly confident in his ability to do justice to the material. "I was terrified," he said. But, starting with "Company," Tunick helped define the characteristic Sondheim sound. In contrast to the sumptuous blare of an entire orchestra at full blast, this was a sound defined by crisper lines, purer colors, more instrumental solos, more variation and contrast of tonal effects.
That sound is certainly present in "Here We Are," the new musical about privileged urbanites trapped in an existential nightmare. Befitting the sinister surrealism of the source material -- the Luis Buñuel films "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" and "The Exterminating Angel" -- Tunick's underscoring at times resembles the effervescently weird music of a Looney Tunes cartoon. And, once again, the orchestra knows something the characters don't, greeting the happy exclamation "What a perfect day!" with notes that jar and thud.
Orchestrating that show after Sondheim's death in 2021 was "like going through the letters of a deceased friend," said Tunick, "editing them for publication." Tunick was happy with the result. "We went out on a high note," he added.
The musical collaboration will carry on, though.
Having already reorchestrated several Sondheim shows -- not just the ones he orchestrated originally -- Tunick is adapting the score of "A Little Night Music" for full orchestra, rendering it more suitable for performance by symphony orchestras and in opera houses. He will conduct a concert and recording of the new version this year.
In an even more profound and lasting way, of course, through cast albums and successive productions, the Sondheim-Tunick collaboration will continue to inspire generations of musical theater lovers -- and reward ever closer listening.
Tunick's last meeting with Sondheim turned out to be only weeks before the composer's death, at a concert of Tunick's work at Sharon Playhouse in Connecticut. Tunick took the opportunity to say a few words to his longtime collaborator: "I know you hate sentimentality. But I have to tell you how much it's meant to me, working with you all these years."
As Tunick tearily remembers it, Sondheim put his arm around him, saying, "Jonathan, we're lucky we met one another."

A Hint of Monty Python Amid a Messiah's Story: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: LaKeith Stanfield leads a predominantly Black cast in a retelling of the story of Jesus that's both irreverent and devoted.
The subject of a Jesus movie is technically Jesus. But every movie based on the biblical account of Jesus -- and there are many such movies, stretching back to 1898 -- says at least as much about the people who made it as it does about the man himself.
Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" paints a heavily Catholic, heavily bloody image of a suffering hero. Franco Zeffirelli's "Jesus of Nazareth" draws a romantic, Renaissance-derived portrait of a lush, otherworldly Christ. "The Jesus Film," produced for evangelistic purposes, takes its text entirely from the biblical account, attempting to render a literalist version of a savior. William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" functions almost like a Rosencrantz and Guildenstern version of the story, with the main character crossing paths with Jesus only occasionally while experiencing a more broadly appealing revelation about radical forgiveness and loving one's enemies. (And, yes, racing chariots.)
"The Book of Clarence" is something entirely different than these and dozens of other renderings. But it bears some passing resemblance to another contemporary Jesus hit: "The Chosen," a wildly popular television show that was crowdfunded and initially distributed by Angel Studios (distributor of last year's megahit "Sound of Freedom"), and was so popular on streamers that the CW bought the rights to broadcast the first three seasons in 2023. (The fourth season will premiere exclusively in theaters this February.) Its popularity owes as much to a broad appetite for faith-inflected content as to its central concept: This is Jesus and those around him as you've never seen them before. They're humans, with lives and dramas -- not flat figures on a stained-glass window, or storybook characters, or ethereal saints. (It helps that the Jesus of "The Chosen," unlike many other representations, actually looks like he's from the Middle East.)
As with that series, "The Book of Clarence" is a highly ambitious attempt at relatability, with an added reverence for the old-school "Ben-Hur"-era Hollywood biblical epics. Jeymes Samuel, who wrote and directed the film, clearly knows and loves the Bible story. He also doesn't feel particularly beholden to a literalist rendering of the text. Here, Jesus and the apostles and their neighbors and friends are played by Black actors from around the diaspora, mostly in their own accents. The white actors play the Romans, a colonizing force of oppression.
If I counted right, the words "Jew" and "Israel" aren't uttered in "The Book of Clarence," and "Palestine" only a couple of times. Instead, the film uses the blueprint of the biblical narrative and a gifted cast to build out an apocryphal tale of someone who's not in the story at all: Clarence (LaKeith Stanfield), the twin brother of Jesus' apostle Thomas (also played by Stanfield), who lives with his mother (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and is in a world of trouble. (The Bible does suggest Thomas has a twin, but that's the extent of it.) Clarence has debts to a guy named Jedediah the Terrible (Eric Kofi-Abrefa), who is ready to crucify him -- literally -- if he doesn't pay the money back by the deadline. Clarence is also in love with Jedediah's younger sister (Anna Diop) and trying, with the help of his best friend Elijah (RJ Cyler), to raise the money to stay alive and get her to take him seriously.
After some mishaps -- including a very funny scene with John the Baptist (David Oyelowo) and a fight-turned-friendship with a gladiator named Barabbas (Omar Sy) -- Clarence has an idea. There seems to be a lot of money in being a messiah, a guy who goes around preaching and collecting followers. Why not him?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
There's a hint of "Monty Python's Life of Brian" around "The Book of Clarence." I'm fairly confident that nobody in first-century Palestine was named Clarence, for one, which makes the character -- an atheist stoner who sells first-century weed and gambles -- stick out self-consciously, a guy from 2024 plunked down in ancient Jerusalem. There's also a looseness to "Life of Brian" that "The Book of Clarence" sometimes apes, an episodic nature that in this case feels more like unfocused narrative structure.
But something "Life of Brian" does that few Jesus movies have accomplished is give a sense of the proliferation of self-proclaimed messiahs in the era, as common as influencers and wellness gurus. "The Book of Clarence," too, stretches that premise out to a comic effect, though it eventually turns tragic. This film is considerably more serious and reverent about its topic than poor Brian's tale. (Nobody's singing about looking on the bright side of life at this Golgotha.)
Does it work? Sometimes! And it's also sort of a mess. Samuel is telling a contemporary spin on the tale, and focuses a great deal on both Roman oppression and Clarence's journey toward meaning and purpose -- to fully embody his potential, something that can only happen when he believes in God. Taking an occasional foray into magical realism, the movie is more concerned with the divinity inside Clarence than it is with Jesus' work, which makes it not entirely clear why Jesus is even in this one. It's an empowerment ballad, a plea with the audience to break free of their own chains. All of those themes muddle the mixture, and Samuel's stylistic flourishes and musical cues get repetitive and overbearing after a while.
But what's good about "The Book of Clarence" is what so many movies lack: taking really, really big swings. There are fights with gladiators and a chariot race. But there's flashy camerawork that quotes both music videos and old movies, with a lot of zooms and cuts and wipes and iris effects.
At one point the characters go to a sort of roadside hookah bar at which something very strong is in the bowl, and other patrons, caught in ecstasy, float in midair. When Clarence gets an idea, a lightbulb appears over his head. The crucifixion scene is startlingly graphic. There are a few swear words and sex jokes and, really, just a whole lot going on. "The Book of Clarence" is undeniably a faith-driven movie, despite its elements that would never show up in a release from the conventional Christian film industry. Mimicking and flouting genre conventions, it keeps the audience guessing, and it's better for it.
So, having seen a whole lot of Jesus content over the years, I have to admire what Samuel is after here. Retellings of the Jesus narrative are as ubiquitous as retellings of, say, Shakespeare, but are much less inventive on the whole. If "The Book of Clarence" doesn't totally work, its combination of the sacred and the irreverent is enchanting. It gets bogged down in its own mud, but it's certainly shooting for the stars.
The Book of Clarence
Rated PG-13 for crucifixion, crudeness and ancient weed. Running time: 2 hours 16 minutes. In theaters.

Not Your Average Lady of the House: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Todd Haynes and Julianne Moore take one of the most overlooked characters in Hollywood and peel back the layers to expose lonely souls and monsters.
Near the beginning of Todd Haynes's new film, "May December," there's a moment that has become the subject of fascination. Julianne Moore's Gracie Atherton-Yoo is preparing for a barbecue. She tells her teenage twins to be careful as they head to the rooftop with friends, and then she goes to the fridge. The music swells. A look of fear crosses her face: "I don't think we have enough hot dogs."
It's certainly a funny beat, but it's also one that taps into themes that Haynes has been exploring and subverting with Moore for nearly 30 years: the construct of the perfect American suburban housewife. Gracie's expression indicates something is indeed terribly wrong, but it's just the thin notion that her day might not go as planned. The worst thing that could happen is that there might not be enough hot dogs. (The next cut reveals there are plenty of hot dogs.)
But Gracie is, of course, no ordinary housewife. She's married to Joe (Charles Melton), who was just 13 when they began the relationship that would send her to prison, where she gave birth to their first child. And yet the life she has built for herself is, on the surface, idyllic. She has a house by the water. She bakes cakes and hosts parties. If not for the circumstances of how she and her husband got together, she would seem the ideal wife and mother. Or would she?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Since Haynes's first collaboration with Moore, on "Safe" (1995), the two have worked together to dig into his -- and America's -- preoccupation with the housewife archetype. But these women, as Haynes envisions them and as Moore portrays them, are never quite what they seem, and their movies chip away at notions of domestic femininity that the characters at first hold dear.
Each film -- "Safe," "Far From Heaven" (2002) and now "May December" -- opens with a Moore housewife living contentedly in carefully curated spaces. Then we watch as her views are challenged by outside forces that pollute the havens she has created. Together, Haynes and Moore probe the psyches of women who are so often dismissed as a sunny June Cleaver from "Leave It to Beaver" type, there to serve and do little else.
In different films, these characters might be treated as window dressing. Cinema history is littered with overlooked spouses, but Moore and Haynes instead analyze them. Moore's knack for playing fragility gives these ladies a disarmingly porcelain quality that we watch get shattered.
In "Safe," Moore is Carol, a wife and stepmother living in the San Fernando Valley in 1987. Her days are filled with little tasks -- gardening, going to the gym -- and initially the biggest disruption seems to involve the couch she and her husband have ordered arriving in the wrong color. The moment of that realization anticipates Moore's hot dog exclamation in "May December." She stops in her tracks and exclaims, "Oh my God!" with a look of utter dismay as if this were a terrible tragedy.
But then Carol grows sick, and she begins to suspect that it's the modern world that is poisoning her. Her illness means she can no longer go about her routine of easy socializing with other women in her sphere. At a baby shower full of minor pleasantries, a friend's child is sitting on her lap when she has an attack. The others at the party notice her gasping for air, but they are slow to go to her side. Haynes holds her in a frame all alone for a beat as the camera closes in on her face in a state of sheer distress and the ominous score by Ed Tomney hums.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Moore plays Carol with an almost babylike voice. And yet that innocence, also demonstrated by her penchant for drinking milk, cannot protect her from the toxicity that she claims her body rejects. By the end, she has left her home duties and husband behind and moved to a self-help retreat, where even the usual cabins are too exposed for her. The only way she can survive is contained inside a safe house. She looks in a small mirror and tells herself, "I love you."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Haynes once explained to The Film Stage that with the movie, he "wanted your own narrative expectations to first drive this woman out of a certain kind of oppression, and then ultimately drive her back into it." At the end, Carol is still sheltered, but not like she used to be; she's sheltered in a completely different, arguably even more unnerving way. She has broken free from her housewife existence; however, she has locked herself up. She loves herself, but at what cost?
The same can be said of Moore's Cathy Whitaker in "Far From Heaven," Haynes's homage to the melodramas of Douglas Sirk set in the 1950s. Cathy -- a demure presence who uses words like "jiminy" -- is so practiced at her role as a devoted housewife that in one of her early scenes she is being interviewed for a local gazette as a model for other women "with families and home to keep up." But as she's talking to the reporter she notices something that shakes her: a Black man walking through her yard. His presence is alien in the fall Connecticut foliage. She softens when she hears that he is Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert), the son of her late gardener.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Raymond's arrival coincides with another revelation for Cathy. Late one night she decides to bring dinner to her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid), in his office, dutifully fulfilling her role as a caretaker. She finds him kissing another man. As she wrestles with her husband's homosexuality, she starts to feel like an outlier among her crowd. That feeling becomes manifest when she starts to associate publicly with Raymond, breaking the neighborhood's taboo of friendship with a Black person. She speaks to him at an art exhibition, drawing sneering glances from her peers. It's a scene that in some ways echoes the baby shower in "Safe." We can see how Cathy becomes unusual to the other women around her, except in this case she finds human connection she never knew she needed.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Still, like Carol, Cathy gets no happy ending. She and Frank decide to divorce, and Raymond, after his daughter is injured in a racist attack, chooses to move away. Cathy tries to catch Raymond before his train leaves, and while they share a smile, he doesn't disembark. Cathy is alone. With both Carol and Cathy, we watch their worlds being broken open and root for that experience to push them into better places. Instead, both are abandoned. For as much as they may try to leave their societal roles behind, they are powerless to undo the decades of conditioning that boxed in women like them.
On the surface, Gracie from "May December" has much in common with Carol and Cathy: her desire for her home to be beautiful; her distinctive, childlike way of speaking. And yet Gracie differs from her fellow heroines and not simply because she's the only one of the Moore heroines not written by Haynes; the movie's screenplay is by Samy Burch. From the outset we know there's a rot inside Gracie. It's not her environment that's a plague: It's Gracie herself.
The plot is set in motion by the arrival of an actress, Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), who wants to study Gracie to play her in an independent film. But while Elizabeth stirs up latent emotions in Joe, Gracie resolutely maintains the blinders she has put on that allow her to live an ostensibly normal, guilt-free life despite her crimes. In the middle of an awkward family dinner at a restaurant, after Gracie's older children from her previous marriage arrive, she encounters Elizabeth in the bathroom. Elizabeth asks her what her expectations were for the evening.
"That tonight would go well, that my children would love me and my life would be perfect," Gracie explains. Elizabeth suggests that perspective is naïve, to which Gracie responds, without irony, "I am naïve. I always have been. In a way, it's been a gift."
Carol and Cathy are tempted to venture beyond their confines, but Gracie takes solace in hers. She's an American monster who uses the stereotype of the good housewife to live with the evil she has committed. While her compatriots end their stories in isolation, Gracie gets to go back to worrying about hot dogs. Domesticity isn't a prison for her. It's a safe house.

Societal Struggles Play Out in the Classroom: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An idealistic teacher in a German school meets reality, and it's messier than she could have imagined.
Teaching, like parenting or skiing or governing or making a souffle, is an activity you can learn about from books and classes and movies, but only really understand on the job. Carla Nowak (Leonie Benesch), a new teacher in a German school, seems to have arrived in her sixth-grade classroom armed with theories and techniques for gaining the trust and respect of her students. But she's about to discover, as many a teacher has before, that actually managing a classroom is not as easy as they make it seem on TV.
In some ways, Ilker Catak's "The Teachers' Lounge" (which is Germany's international feature film entry to the Academy Awards) feels like a direct rebuttal to the glut of so-called magical teacher movies, which abound throughout cinema. In that genre (think of "Freedom Writers," "Mona Lisa Smile" or "Dead Poets Society"), an idealistic teacher encounters reticence and struggle but manages to break through to her students and make a difference in their lives. Teachers do this, of course, but if you only watched Hollywood's rendering of the classroom you might think stirring success is inevitable.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But Ms. Nowak's good intentions are thwarted at every turn. (Everyone uses honorifics in this school, including faculty.) Her students are a typical bunch, a mix of high achievers, do-gooders, slackers and cut-ups. Someone in the school, however, is stealing from others, and nobody can pin down who the perpetrator might be. Ms. Nowak is horrified when another teacher asks student council representatives to snitch, or at least say who they think might be doing it, especially when Ali (Can Rodenbostel) is the one they accuse. He's the son of Turkish immigrants, and when his parents arrive to explain to the administrators why it wasn't him, unsubtle racism pervades the room.
This is where it becomes clear that "The Teachers' Lounge," despite its realism, is strongest on the allegorical level. The modern classroom has been described by philosophers and theorists as carceral, an institution in which children are indoctrinated into disciplinary systems that will govern their whole lives: in the workplace, in the justice system, in the public square. You must arrive on time, follow rules and schedules, respond to the buzzer, submit to evaluations and repeat it all tomorrow. This school -- or at least Ms. Nowak's part of it -- prides itself on its democratic fairness, its freedom of speech and the press, its attitude of self-governance.
But of course, it's really the teachers who are in charge here, and elements of contemporary society seep in from all sides. Misinformation flies around, helped along by slanted journalism. Teachers demand students open their wallets in a random inspection, telling them that "if you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear." Phones and parents' group chats create a surveillance society that Ms. Nowak detests, but cannot escape; eventually, suspecting the theft may be coming from somewhere other than the classroom, she sets up her own form of surveillance, with catastrophic results.
Taking on the uneasy complexity of a progressive modern society, and the friction produced when pluralism and an insistence on order and obedience collide, is a bold move, and "The Teachers' Lounge" pulls it off with a sense of tension that makes the whole thing play like a thriller. There's a level on which it's darkly funny, especially if you've spent time around preteens. Every time Ms. Nowak thinks she has a solution, it goes sideways, in part because you cannot count on sixth-graders to just go along with suggestions from adults. Trying to build classroom solidarity after an outburst, she selects six students to complete a familiar team-building exercise of the kind that might delight 8-year-olds and mildly irritate adults on a company retreat. Here, though, it ends in predictable bedlam.
A society is not very easy to keep in harmony, and a fully democratic attempt to keep the peace in any group is bound to result in a tug of war between authoritarian and even fascist principles on the one hand and unfettered chaos on the other. Catak places that struggle in a classroom, but it's clear that like other European directors (including Michael Haneke and the brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne), he's slyly telling a story about a society much, much larger than the kind found on a campus.
Meanwhile, the students -- who are Zoomers, after all -- are tuned into the issues around them and ready to fight back. They organize. They refuse to comply. They denounce censorship. They talk about practicing solidarity against "measures otherwise found in rogue regimes" and the "structural racisms that our school, like others, can't escape." Their power is limited, but they know how to talk about it. They have learned well from their teachers. But have their teachers learned the lesson, too?
The Teachers' Lounge

Moviegoers Tuned Out Spectacle in 2023: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Movie audiences flocked to Taylor Swift, "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" but were cooler toward returning superheroes like the Flash, Captain Marvel and Aquaman.
Hollywood's movie factories run on conventional wisdom -- entrenched notions, based on experience, about what types of films are likely to pop at the global box office.
This year, audiences turned many of those so-called rules on their heads.
Superheroes have long been seen as the most reliable way to fill seats. But characters like Captain Marvel, the Flash, Ant-Man, Shazam and Blue Beetle failed to excite moviegoers. Over the weekend, "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom," which cost more than $ 200 million to make and tens of millions more to market, arrived to a disastrous $ 28 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada. Overseas moviegoers chipped in another $ 80 million.
In the meantime, the biggest movie of the year at the box office, "Barbie," with $ 1.44 billion in worldwide ticket sales, was directed by a woman, based on a very female toy and spray-painted pink -- ingredients that most studios have long seen as limiting audience appeal. An old movie-industry maxim holds that women will go to a "guy" movie but not vice versa.
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie" collected $ 1.36 billion, a second-place result that also stunned Hollywood; studios have a troubled history with game adaptations. "Oppenheimer," a three-hour period drama about a physicist, rounded out the top three, taking in $ 952 million and contradicting the prevailing belief that, in the streaming era, films for grown-ups are not viable in theaters.
"Without question, change is afoot -- audiences are in a different mood," said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. "The country and the world are not in the same place. We've had seven years of divisive politics, a severe pandemic, two serious wars, climate change and inflation. Moviegoers seem less interested in being overwhelmed with spectacle and saving the universe than being spoken to, entertained and inspired."
The biggest box office surprises of the year fell into the "spoken to" category. "Sound of Freedom," a crime drama that cost $ 15 million to make, catered to the far right, an audience largely ignored by Hollywood, and generated $ 248 million in ticket sales, on a par with "The Eras Tour," which targeted Taylor Swift fans and also cost about $ 15 million.
"Sound of Freedom" came from Angel Studios, an independent company in Provo, Utah, that supported the film with an unorthodox "Pay It Forward" program, which let supporters buy tickets online for those who otherwise might not see it. In a big break from Hollywood norms, Ms. Swift cut out the middle company (a studio) and made a distribution deal directly with AMC Entertainment, the world's largest theater operator.
"Our phone has been dancing off the hooks since the day we announced the 'Eras Tour' project," Adam Aron, AMC's chief executive, told investors on a conference call in November, referring to "alternative content" opportunities.
Comscore, which compiles box office data, projected on Sunday that North American ticket sales for the year would reach about $ 9 billion, a 20 percent increase from 2022. (Before the pandemic, North American theaters reliably sold about $ 11 billion in tickets annually.) The average price for an adult general admission ticket in the United States was $ 12.14, up from $ 11.75, according to EntTelligence, a research firm.
Worldwide ticket sales are expected to exceed $ 33 billion, an increase of 27 percent, partly because of a surge in Latin America. (Before the pandemic, worldwide ticket sales easily exceeded $ 40 billion annually.)
Hollywood's climb back from the pandemic is expected to stall in 2024. With fewer movies scheduled for release -- studio pipelines were disrupted by the recent strikes -- ticket sales will decline 5 to 11 percent next year, depending on the market, according to projections from Gower Street Analytics, a box office research firm.
Reading box-office tea leaves is like pontificating about symbolism in works of fiction: Any halfway plausible theory works. But studio bosses need something, anything, to guide them as they make billion-dollar judgment calls for the seasons ahead.
Here are five takeaways from this year:
Moviegoers want comfort.
People reach for nostalgia in times of stress, and movies that reminded audiences of the past -- while also managing to feel fresh -- have been succeeding. "Barbie," "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," "The Little Mermaid," "Wonka" and the retro-feeling "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem" allowed people to revisit their childhoods. "Insidious: The Red Door" hit pay dirt by bringing back the franchise's original stars.
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" could have tapped into nostalgia to become a hit. Instead, a huffing and puffing Harrison Ford, 81, simply reminded Indy fans that they, too, are getting old. "Dial of Destiny" cost Disney $ 295 million to make and took in a flaccid $ 384 million. (Theaters keep roughly 50 percent of ticket sales.)
Art film has a pulse.
Sophisticated dramas with modest budgets and aimed at older audiences have been showing signs of life after two years in the box office I.C.U.
The streaming era has forever shifted the bulk of prestige film viewing to the home, analysts say. But theaters found a modicum of success in 2023 with offerings like "Past Lives," a wistful drama with some Korean dialogue, and Hayao Miyazaki's animated "The Boy and the Heron." The bespoke "Asteroid City" managed $ 54 million.
Early box office results have also been promising for Oscar-oriented films like "Poor Things," a surreal science-fiction romance, and "American Fiction," a satire about a writer who puts together a fake memoir that turns on racial stereotypes.
Bigger is not better.
For the past decade, Hollywood has kept audiences interested in sequels by making each installment more bloated and often nonsensical than the last. Bigger! Faster! More!
That strategy may need rethinking -- it's just too expensive, analysts say, especially with Chinese moviegoers souring on American blockbusters. "Fast X," the 10th movie in the "Fast and Furious" series, cost an estimated $ 340 million and took in $ 705 million worldwide, including $ 140 million in China. By comparison, "Furious 7" in 2015 cost $ 190 million and collected $ 1.5 billion, including $ 391 million in China.
Tom Cruise's seventh "Mission: Impossible" spectacle, released in July in the wake of "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer," cost roughly $ 290 million to make and collected $ 568 million, including $ 49 million in China. The sixth "Mission: Impossible" in 2018 cost $ 178 million and generated $ 792 million, with Chinese ticket buyers chipping in $ 181 million.
Increasingly, franchise sequels and spinoffs need to feel fresh to succeed. Lionsgate, for instance, delved deeper into the High Table underground crime organization in "John Wick: Chapter 4" and introduced "Hunger Games" fans to a new story line (and cast) in the prequel "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes." Both movies were hits. Lionsgate even revived its "Saw" horror franchise by shifting the narrative back in time.
"Each of those movies did something different than the prior," said Adam Fogelson, vice chair of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group. "It wasn't just 'spend more, make it bigger, make it louder and cram in more action."'
Some audience patterns remain intact.
Horror continued to be a reliable performer, with "Five Nights at Freddy's" and "M3gan" starting new franchises for Universal and its Blumhouse affiliate. Together, the two films cost $ 32 million. They collected a combined $ 469 million. Also notable was "The Nun II," which cost Warner Bros. about $ 38 million and took in $ 268 million.
Superheroes may be down, but they're not out. Marvel's rollicking, well-established "Guardians of the Galaxy" series returned for a third chapter and generated $ 846 million against a $ 250 million budget. Sony's bold, anime-influenced "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" cost an estimated $ 150 million and collected $ 691 million.
Stars matter.
The conventional wisdom in Hollywood has been that movie stars are essentially part of the past. A celebrity name above the title no longer carries that much weight with ticket buyers. The underlying "intellectual property" is what fills seats.
People pay to see Barbie, not Margot Robbie.
Except that Mattel and various studios tried for at least 20 years to turn the toy into a live-action movie star. It took Ms. Robbie in the role (and Ryan Gosling as Ken) to finally make it happen. Other movies that benefited from star power in 2023 included "Wonka," with Timothée Chalamet, and "Creed III," anchored by Michael B. Jordan.
Stars don't have heft? Try telling that to the producers of "Gran Turismo," "Haunted Mansion," "Dumb Money" and "Strays," all of which disappointed at the box office and arrived when their casts were barred from promoting their work because of the SAG-AFTRA strike.

From the Land of Narnia To 'Interpretation of Dreams': [Review]

Full text: Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis probably never met. What the stage-based film presupposes is: Maybe they did?
In "Freud's Last Session," when the Oxford academic C.S. Lewis (Matthew Goode) arrives late to the London home of Sigmund Freud (Anthony Hopkins), Freud's chow chow, Jofi, brushes him off. The dog, Freud explains, values punctuality.
The men's encounter -- concocted for Mark St. Germain's 2009 play of the same title -- is imaginary, but the timing is not. The setting is September 1939, and Hitler has invaded Poland. The atheist Freud has sought out Lewis, whom he has never met, to learn how such a sterling intellect could believe in God. Given the historical backdrop (we hear radio of Neville Chamberlain announcing Britain's entry into the war), that hardly seems like the most pressing topic. That's true even if Freud, who has oral cancer, would be dead before the end of that month.
But the war context gives the director, Matthew Brown, who shares screenwriting credit with St. Germain, license to wage a futile campaign against the material's stage-bound origins. An air raid siren sends Lewis and Freud out of the house and to a nearby church, where Freud helps Lewis through a triggered recollection of his service in World War I. Freud shows off his surprising expertise in Christian iconography, after dismissing his interest as simple art appreciation.
The men return to Freud's den, but the movie, already diffuse with flashbacks, is hardly content to stay put. Before the tête-à-tête is over, the film will have shown us Lewis in the trenches (Freud is fascinated by Lewis's fixation on the mother of a fallen friend); the Gestapo's arrest and improbable release of Freud's youngest daughter, Anna, before the family's flight from Vienna; and Freud's father chiding young Sigmund after seeing the boy cross himself.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Expanding what was a two-character play, the film adds a major part for Anna (Liv Lisa Fries), a pioneer in the field of child psychoanalysis. Her devotion to her father is depicted as so intense that a colleague diagnoses an attachment disorder. But her dad refuses to accept that she is in a relationship with a woman, Dorothy Tiffany Burlingham (Jodi Balfour). And his professional curiosity about her mind may have monstrously overpowered his compassion as a father.
What a viewer (or a therapist) should take from their queasily etched codependency is unclear, and it's not certain that the script made sense of it, either. But the Sigmund-Anna muddle has more juice than the genteel intellectual parrying between Sigmund and C.S. (or Jack, as he was known to familiars), which has been carefully written to a draw. Lewis argues that the Gospels can't be myths because they are too disorganized. Freud scoffs that "bad storytelling" doesn't prove Christ was a divine figure. Lewis pounces when Freud unthinkingly says, "Thank God." Later, Freud asks how God could let him lose a daughter to the flu and a grandson to tuberculosis.
Eventually they bridge their differences, in a détente made grotesquely literal (and Freudian?) when Lewis reaches into Freud's mouth to help with a dental prosthesis. Hopkins already argued the other side of this case when he played an older, Narnia-era Lewis in "Shadowlands" (1993) -- a Lewis who, oddly, gave a near-identical speech to this film's Freud about humanity's need to "grow up." In any case, Hopkins parlayed Lewis's propriety, airs and implied discomfort around sex into a more compelling character than Goode has been given, and one who -- faced with his wife's death -- urgently considered the absence of God.
The look of "Freud's Last Session" could make one doubt the presence of a cinematographer. Shot after shot is so gray, shadowy and colorless that it's hard not to wonder why Brown didn't shoot in black-and-white, whose contrast and timelessness would suit the stakes. The filmmakers might argue that black-and-white is no longer commercially viable. But Freud would say that nobody wanted anyone to see this movie.

Full text: Our favorites include premiere recordings of works by Thomas Adès and Anna Thorvaldsdottir, as well as portraits of Missy Mazzoli and Kaija Saariaho.
Thomas Adès: 'Dante'
Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra; Gustavo Dudamel, conductor (Nonesuch)
This recording has so much to applaud: the achievement of Thomas Adès in writing such a clever, vivid, effective work; the ambition of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in performing its hour and a half of music in a single evening and taping it live; the wisdom of Nonesuch in releasing the audio. Essential listening. DAVID ALLEN
Bach: 'Goldberg' Variations
Vikingur Olafsson, piano (Deutsche Grammophon)
The finest interpreters of the "Goldberg" Variations balance the individuality of each section with a sense of shape over the work's 75 minutes. Vikingur Olafsson does that -- achieving unity while avoiding flatness -- and more, from a beautifully simple Aria to a life-affirming Quodlibet and back, with nostalgic sweetness, to the Aria again. JOSHUA BARONE
'Broken Branches'
Karim Sulayman, tenor; Sean Shibe, guitar (Pentatone)
This year, there wasn't anything in classical music quite like this thoughtful program of songs, arranged for Karim Sulayman's alluring voice and Sean Shibe's expressive guitar, that create dialogues across cultures and centuries -- raising complicated questions about identity, exoticization and exchange along the way -- while providing an absolutely beautiful listening experience. JOSHUA BARONE
Byrd: 'The Golden Renaissance'
Stile Antico (Decca)
William Byrd died 400 years ago this July, and the anniversary celebrations offered no finer tribute than this typically imaginative, immaculate record from Stile Antico. At its heart is the Mass for Four Voices; I could listen to the exquisitely tender "Agnus Dei" all day, and for a week or two last winter, I think I actually did. DAVID ALLEN
Christopher Cerrone: 'In a Grove'
Metropolis Ensemble; Andrew Cyr, conductor (In a Circle)
Christopher Cerrone and Stephanie Fleischmann's "In a Grove," an operatic retelling of the short story that also inspired the film "Rashomon," is a vividly immersive thriller about the nature of truth and memory. Not a word or note is without dramaturgical purpose, and both are captured, if not enhanced, in this richly produced recording. JOSHUA BARONE
'Contra-Tenor'
Michael Spyres, tenor; Il Pomo d'Oro; Francesco Corti, conductor (Erato)
With a juicy, chesnut-colored timbre, a stupefying three-octave range and a keen instinct for showmanship, Michael Spyres flies through virtuoso arias from the Baroque and early Classical eras. It's 70 minutes of gobsmacking singing. The effervescent playing of Il Pomo d'Oro contributes to the album's heady effect. OUSSAMA ZAHR
'Julius Eastman, Vol. 3: If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?'
Wild Up; Devonté Hynes and Adam Tendler, pianos (New Amsterdam)
This latest in Wild Up's series of recordings of works by Julius Eastman takes on three stormy, swiftly shifting, open-ended scores, rendered in new arrangements for a large and varied ensemble with passion, richness and complexity -- a forest of details -- and a controlled chaos inspired by free jazz. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Fantasia'
Igor Levit, piano (Sony Classical)
Refulgent Bach, poetically precise Liszt, twilit Berg, artfully brooding Busoni -- the pianist Igor Levit is aware of style but more beholden to affect. He works methodically, his mind on not just the next bar but the next page, as he proves the coherence and the imagination of this album's expansive, fantasy-like pieces. OUSSAMA ZAHR
Fauré: 'Nocturnes & Barcarolles'
Marc-André Hamelin (Hyperion)
Fauré's 13 nocturnes and 13 barcarolles -- two and a half hours in all -- are not the kind of dizzyingly virtuosic works that are the fire-fingered Marc-André Hamelin's stock in trade. But his clarity and sensitivity confirm that this is music of tender poignancy and subtle experimentation. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Gradus ad Parnassum'
Jean Rondeau, harpsichord (Erato)
Taking on works for piano by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Debussy on this quietly audacious album -- a reflection on influence, transcription and re-creation -- the harpsichordist Jean Rondeau also shows his gift for in-the-moment artfulness in pieces originally for his instrument by Palestrina, Clementi and Johann Joseph Fux. ZACHARY WOOLFE
Johnson: 'De Organizer' and 'The Dreamy Kid'
University of Michigan Symphony Orchestra; Kenneth Kiesler, conductor (Naxos)
Here, James P. Johnson, the composer of "The Charleston," sets texts by Langston Hughes and Eugene O'Neill in two short stage works. Aside from scholars, who knew? Well, now everyone can experience this Harlem Stride pianist's talent for orchestration, shaping narrative -- and, on occasion, weaving the feel of spirituals into the fabric of American opera. SETH COLTER WALLS
Liszt: 'Transcendental Études'
Yunchan Lim, piano (Steinway & Sons)
Yunchan Lim was just 18 when he played this formidable Liszt collection during the semifinals of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition last year. He is already so mind-bogglingly accomplished technically, and so refined musically, that these formidable works sound easy. "I'd like to be a musician with infinite possibilities," he has said. And so he would appear to be. DAVID ALLEN
Wynton Marsalis: Symphony No. 4, 'The Jungle'
Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra; Nicholas Buc, conductor (Blue Engine Records)
Wynton Marsalis's best symphony draws from his familiar lodestars. Duke Ellington looms large, as ever and as he ought. But other affinities also bloom: post-Minimalist orchestral riffing, pastoral melody and noir ambience all have their say. Plus, Marsalis's climactic trumpet exclamations summon Cootie Williams from the grave. SETH COLTER WALLS
Missy Mazzoli: 'Dark With Excessive Bright'
Peter Herresthal, violin; Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra; Arctic Philharmonic; Tim Weiss, James Gaffigan, conductors (Bis)
Missy Mazzoli is a master of chiaroscuro. Her first full-length album of orchestral music opens with a bold statement of blinding light and warmly inviting darkness. Her compositions have a signature sound and a sense of movement, as in the enlarging circles of "Sinfonia (for Orbiting Spheres)" and the plunging explorations of "These Worlds in Us." OUSSAMA ZAHR
Mendelssohn: 'Quartets Vol. 2'
Quatuor Van Kuijk (Alpha)
It can be difficult, throughout this survey of Mendelssohn's string quartets, to tell whether one or four instruments are being played, so unified are the Quatuor Van Kuijk players in their interpretation and delivery. At their most impressive, as in their excellent Schubert album, they are capable of shattering expressivity without a hint of sentimentality. JOSHUA BARONE
Monteverdi: 'Vespro della Beata Vergine'
Pygmalion; Raphaël Pichon, conductor (Harmonia Mundi)
There was good reason to think a little more deeply about the future of the period-instrument movement this year, but in Raphaël Pichon and his Pygmalion ensemble, the future may already be here. They already have a strong list of recordings to their name, but this is one of their most daring, fervent and joyous and free. DAVID ALLEN
Ravel: 'L'Oeuvre Pour Piano'
Philippe Bianconi, piano (La Dolce Volta)
The French pianist Philippe Bianconi traces his pedagogical lineage back to Ravel's circle, and the result is an album that is magical and transporting, lean and precise. There is no wallowing, no schmaltz. The melancholy he finds in "Sonatine" is as sharply observed as the jerky flight of moths in "Noctuelles." OUSSAMA ZAHR
Saariaho: 'Reconnaissance'
Helsinki Chamber Choir; Nils Schweckendiek, conductor (Bis)
The painful loss of Kaija Saariaho this year makes this album particularly precious. Saariaho's choral music -- including the title work, from 2020, to a text about encounters with Mars -- looks back to medieval chant and Renaissance madrigals, and forward to a future of eerie cyborg combinations of the acoustic and electronic. ZACHARY WOOLFE
'Rising'
Lawrence Brownlee, tenor; Kevin J. Miller, piano (Warner Classics)
This beautifully curated album has the sound of an artist who went into the recording studio with something urgent and personal to say. Lawrence Brownlee, Rossini tenor extraordinaire, stretches his vibrato-dense instrument to register subtle feelings aroused in him by songs of the African American experience. Captivating in his commitment, he doesn't waste a note. OUSSAMA ZAHR
Henry Threadgill: 'The Other One'
Henry Threadgill Ensemble (Pi Recordings)
This is where the Second Viennese School meets American second line parade music. Recorded live at Roulette in Brooklyn, and conducted by Henry Threadgill, the blend of strings, woodwinds, tuba, piano and percussion on this recording of "Of Valence" conjures jazz combo and chamber music ecstasies alike. SETH COLTER WALLS
'Weather Systems II: Soundlines'
Steven Schick, percussion (Islandia Music Records)
Ever ambitious, the percussionist Steven Schick fills this set with three hours of self-challenges, including Xenakis's benchmark "Psappha"; Vivian Fung's "The Ice Is Talking," played on a block of the frozen stuff; Roger Reynolds's "Here and There," incorporating a Beckett text; and the hourlong sparseness of Sarah Hennies's "Thought Sectors." ZACHARY WOOLFE
Tchaikovsky: Symphony No. 5
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; Manfred Honeck, conductor (Reference Recordings)
Manfred Honeck and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra have a habit of recording benchmark accounts of classic works, and this Tchaikovsky is no exception. It's not just their ability to make the most of even the tiniest details that makes this account special, but also how each of those details speaks in service of Honeck's hair-raising conception of the work. DAVID ALLEN
Anna Thorvaldsdottir: 'Archora/Aion'
Iceland Symphony Orchestra; Eva Ollikainen, conductor (Sono Luminus)
The Icelandic composer Anna Thorvaldsdottir has long been associated with evocations of the earth and tectonic forces. Here, especially in the symphony-length "Aion," her preoccupation is still ecological, but in an abstract, grander sense that surveys immense textures and forms from ever-shifting scales of time and space. Feel small yet? JOSHUA BARONE
Mary Lou Williams: 'Zodiac Suite'
Aaron Diehl Trio and the Knights; Eric Jacobsen, conductor (Mack Avenue Records)
The chamber orchestra edition of Mary Lou Williams's "Zodiac Suite" receives marvelous new life here. The Knights revel in textures flowing from her appreciation of Hindemith; a rhythm section locks into swing grooves. The pianist Aaron Diehl moves deftly between those worlds, and supports an art-song finale that features the soprano Mikaela Bennett. SETH COLTER WALLS
Eric Wubbels: "If and Only If"
Josh Modney, violin; Mariel Roberts, cello; Eric Wubbels, piano (Carrier Records)
The composer-performer Eric Wubbels brings meticulous poise to his experimentalism. Each new movement of this hourlong piano trio may sound alarming at first. But it's not shock for shock's sake: Wubbels maintains immersion in alternate tunings and microtonality in order to set up gradual, ravishing changes. You just might bliss out. SETH COLTER WALLS

Adrift on the Tides of Fake Love: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romp in a rom-com bomb with gratuitous clothes-shedding, played out against beautiful backdrops.
The floundering romantic comedy "Anyone but You" has several things going for it: the rising stars Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, a luxurious Australian backdrop, and more white teeth and washboard abs than the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. The plot is a classic switchback prank. Sworn enemies Bea (Sweeney) and Ben (Powell) pretend to fall in love at a destination wedding so that their friends and family (Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, Bryan Brown, Michelle Hurd and GaTa) will quit trying to trick them into liking each other. It's a loose reworking of "Much Ado About Nothing," and, presumably, the first Shakespeare adaptation where a dog does yoga -- and certainly the first in which a man (GaTa) serenades a koala. Nevertheless, the film, directed by Will Gluck, who wrote the screenplay with Ilana Wolpert, is so awkwardly assembled that our attention gets pulled away from the leads to the bizarrely lavish buffet spreads in the background. We're mildly curious about whether these two fakers will slip between the sheets for real -- and majorly interested in why a guest bedroom has so many bowls of fruit.
"Anyone but You" is being sold as a return to the salacious rom-com, although that's only true for one good scene. Overall, it's more bawdy than erotic. "You know a lot about bathroom law," Ben purrs to Bea when they meet-cute wheedling a restroom key from a barista. After a whirlwind first date, Bea wakes up in Ben's arms fully clothed. The night appears to have been innocent -- at least, that's the implication from Gluck's close-up shot of Bea's cinched belt buckle -- but both panic and settle into a shtick of exchanging public insults with the spite of jilted lovers.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
We can barely make out whether a month has elapsed since that encounter or several years. Just resign yourself to nonsense, like the entrance of Margaret (Charlee Fraser), Ben's ex, with her new boyfriend, Beau (Joe Davidson), a galumphing surfer who promptly attempts to eat a bundle of ceremonial sage. The running time is all flimsy bikinis and flimsier excuses to get people undressed. A tarantula? Strip off those shorts! Itchy sand? Swim trunks begone! A fire? Snuff out the flames with a dress! By the time Bea tumbles into Sydney Harbor, it's a shock that Ben leaps in after her without tearing away his pants.
Sweeney and Powell could do wonders with a better script, something that makes more use of the way they grin at each other like they ate knives for lunch. She's skilled at layered insincerity; he specializes in smirky, put-on machismo, shooting the camera a horrifically funny tongue waggle. Here, their performances get bullied around by the insistent pop soundtrack. One genuinely tender scene involves Bea crooning a peppy Top 40 hit to steady Ben's nerves. But she only gets in a few quiet a cappella bars before Gluck cranks the original at an earsplitting volume -- are you not entertained!? -- and, for good measure, blares it again at the end over some riotous behind-the-scenes karaoke. You wonder if he spent more time on the closing credits than the actual film.
Anyone but You
Rated R for nudity and brash language. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes. In theaters.

Studios Loosen Reluctance To Send Shows to Netflix: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When building their own streaming companies, many entertainment studios ended lucrative licensing deals with Netflix. But they missed the money too much.
For years, entertainment company executives happily licensed classic movies and television shows to Netflix. Both sides enjoyed the spoils: Netflix received popular content like "Friends" and Disney's "Moana," which satisfied its ever-growing subscriber base, and it sent bags of cash back to the companies.
But around five years ago, executives realized they were "selling nuclear weapons technology" to a powerful rival, as Disney's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, put it. Studios needed those same beloved movies and shows for the streaming services they were building from scratch, and fueling Netflix's rise was only hurting them. The content spigots were, in large part, turned off.
Then the harsh realities of streaming began to emerge.
Confronting sizable debt burdens and the fact that most streaming services still don't make money, studios like Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have begun to soften their do-not-sell-to-Netflix stances. The companies are still holding back their most popular content -- movies from the Disney-owned Star Wars and Marvel universes and blockbuster original series like HBO's "Game of Thrones" aren't going anywhere -- but dozens of other films like "Dune" and "Prometheus" and series like "Young Sheldon" are being sent to the streaming behemoth in return for much-needed cash. And Netflix is once again benefiting.
Ted Sarandos, one of Netflix's co-chief executives, said at an investor conference last week that the "availability to license has opened up a lot more than it was in the past," arguing that the studios' earlier decision to hold back content was "unnatural."
"They've always built the studios to license," he said.
As David Decker, the content sales president for Warner Bros. Discovery, said: "Licensing is becoming in vogue again. It never went away, but there's more of a willingness to license things again. It generates money, and it gets content viewed and seen."
In the coming months, Disney will start sending a number of shows from its catalog to Netflix, including "This Is Us," "How I Met Your Mother," "Prison Break" and several editions of ESPN's sports documentary series "30 for 30." "White Collar," a Disney-owned show that used to be part of the same lineup as "Suits" on the USA Network, will also join the service. (Old episodes of "Suits" have been one of Netflix's biggest hits this year.) The popular 2000s-era ABC hit "Lost," which left Netflix in 2018, is also returning next year.
Jeremy Zimmer, the chief executive of the United Talent Agency, said the studios' about face was a "financial necessity."
"They said, 'Wow, in order for us to compete in streaming, it's costing us billions to create new content to drive subscriptions,"' Mr. Zimmer said. "'Where are we going to find the money? Oh! We have this stuff that's been sitting here. We can sell that.' It's a very logical progression."
Acknowledging the motivation, Dan Cohen, the chief content licensing officer for Paramount, said one of the biggest advantages to licensing for traditional media companies was that "the margins tend to be high."
Movies and series from other studios have long provided a vital backbone to Netflix, allowing executives to populate the service with established favorites to complement its original series like "The Crown," "Wednesday" and "The Diplomat." The company said on Tuesday that from January to June, 45 percent of all viewing on the service came from licensed shows and movies.
While the amount of licensed content on the service is growing after a slowdown, content from other studios never completely went away. According to Netflix, the top 10 most-watched movie list for a one-week period ending Dec. 10 includes four films from Universal Pictures alone. Those movies come to Netflix from a handful of agreements with Universal, one of which was reached in 2021, in which new animated theatrical releases like "The Super Mario Bros." go to Netflix as part of a structure that toggles titles between Netflix and Universal's own streaming service, Peacock.
The streaming giant has a similar agreement from 2021 with Sony Pictures, whereby the studio sends movies like "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" and the Jennifer Lawrence comedy "No Hard Feelings" to Netflix four to six months after their theatrical run is complete.
Studios are also licensing content to services like Amazon, Tubi and Hulu, of which Disney is the majority owner. And, in most cases, Netflix does not have exclusive access to the movies and series it's getting; many titles will also be available on entertainment company services like Max and Hulu.
Still, the return to Netflix is notable.
When Warner Bros. was beginning to build out its streaming service -- now known as Max -- in 2020, it held back content from Netflix, which was now a direct and formidable competitor. Netflix has 247 million subscribers worldwide, while Max has less than half that.
David Zaslav tossed that policy aside soon after he took over as chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery in April 2022. Last month, several seasons of "Young Sheldon," a CBS show that Warner Bros. produces, became available on Netflix. The series quickly found itself on the service's top 10 most-watched list.
Many Warner Bros. movie titles also began appearing on Netflix recently, including the 2021 blockbuster "Dune," and D.C. films like "Man of Steel," "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" and "Wonder Woman."
For years, Netflix had been trying to get its hands on HBO content. Though HBO had a history of licensing several of its shows -- "Sex and the City" to the E! Network, for instance, or "The Sopranos" to A&E -- the company steadfastly refused to license to Netflix.
That abruptly changed several months ago when Netflix bought the rights to stream HBO series like "Insecure," "Ballers," "Six Feet Under," "Band of Brothers" and "The Pacific."
Nearly all of the shows quickly became hits on the streaming service.
"I am comfortable with it, and so far, it seems to be working," Casey Bloys, HBO's chairman, said at a news media conference last month, adding that any show that has become available on Netflix has also seen an "uptick" in viewing on the Max streaming service.
Netflix credits its large subscriber base and its recommendation algorithm as the reasons that a 22-year-old show like "Six Feet Under" or a once forgotten basic cable legal drama like "Suits" can become a hit on its service.
"That is a reflection of what we do best," Mr. Sarandos said this week.
Still, Netflix does not anticipate returning the favor.
Mr. Sarandos said that the company doesn't have a division for licensing original series nor does he see any reason to set one up.
"I do think that we can add tremendous value when we license content," he said. "I'm not positive that it's reciprocal."

Sara Tavares, 45, Portuguese Musician Of Rhythms From the African Diaspora: [Biography]

Author: Pareles, Jon

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She drew on rhythms from across the African diaspora and sang in Portuguese, English, Cape Verdean Criolo and Angolan slang.
Sara Tavares, a Portuguese songwriter, singer and guitarist with a gentle voice and an ear for global pop, died on Nov. 19 in Lisbon. She was 45.
Her label, Sony Portugal, announced the death, in a hospital, on social media. She had been diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2009.
Ms. Tavares began her career in the pop mainstream, singing R&B-influenced songs in Portuguese and English. But as she found her own style, she came to embrace her African roots.
Her parents were from Cape Verde, a nation of islands off the coast of Senegal, and Ms. Tavares increasingly drew on rhythms from across the African diaspora: Cape Verdean morna, funaná and coladeira, Brazilian samba and bossa nova, and Angolan semba, as well as funk and salsa.
She often defined rhythmic fusions with her own intricate guitar picking, and she sang in Portuguese, English, Cape Verdean Creole (known as Criolo) and Angolan slang. In "Balancê," the title song of her 2005 album and one of her biggest hits, she sang in Portuguese about wanting to share "A new dance/A mix of semba with samba, mambo with rumba."
Sara Alexandra Lima Tavares was born on Feb. 1, 1978, in Lisbon; her parents had moved to Portugal from Cape Verde earlier in the decade. She grew up admiring American singers like Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway; learned English; and delved into gospel music.
At 16, she won a nationally televised contest, "Chuva de Estrelas," singing the Whitney Houston hit "One Moment in Time." She went on to represent Portugal at the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest.
Her debut EP, "Sara Tavares & Shout," released in 1996, emulated American pop-R&B and featured a gospel choir called Shout. Her 1999 album, "Mi Ma Bo" ("You and Me"), was produced by the Paris-based Congolese songwriter Lokua Kanza and dipped into an international assortment of styles. It was certified gold in Portugal.
Ms. Tavares fully came into her own with the albums she released in the 2000s, which she produced or co-produced herself: "Balancê" in 2005, "Xinti" ("Feel It") in 2009 and -- after a hiatus following her diagnosis with a brain tumor -- "Fitxadu" in 2017, which was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award. ("Fixtadu" is Criolo for the Portuguese "fechado," which means closed.) Intricate, transparent and seemingly effortless, carried by acoustic guitars and percussion, her songs offered yearning introspection, thoughts about love and socially conscious admonitions.
In an interview promoting the release of "Balancê," she said: "When I walk around with my friends, it's a very, very interesting community. We speak Portuguese slang, Angolan slang, some words in Cape Verdean Criolo, and of course some English. In Criolo there are already English and French words. This is because slaves from all over the world had to communicate and didn't speak the same languages."
She added: "I want to be a part of a movement like the African Americans were, like the African Brazilians were. Instead of doing the music of their ancestors, they have created this musical identity of their own. And it is now respected. It is considered whole and authentic and genuine. It will be a long time before the people from my generation do not have to choose between being African or European. I think you shouldn't have to choose."
Between her own albums, Ms. Tavares collaborated widely, recording with the Angolan electronic group Buraka Som Sistema and the Portuguese rapper and singer Slow J, among others. Her last release, in September, was "Kurtidu," a single that used electric guitars and programmed beats. Her voice stayed friendly and airborne on every track she sang, sailing above borders.
Information on survivors was not immediately available.
Ms. Tavares received online tributes from the presidents of both Portugal and Cape Verde, where she had won Cabo Verde Music Awards for best female voice in 2011 and for "Fitxadu" in 2018.
President José Maria Neves of Cape Verde said on Facebook:
"Sara Tavares, through her voice, her smile, her glance, was able to plant peace, friendship and brotherhood among Cape Verdeans, and also between Cape Verdeans and the world." He added, "Your light will illuminate the path that still lies with us, in this land that temporarily welcomes us."

French, by most estimates the world's fifth most spoken language, is changing -- perhaps not in the gilded hallways of the institution in Paris that publishes its official dictionary, but on a rooftop in Abidjan, the largest city in Ivory Coast.
There one afternoon, a 19-year-old rapper who goes by the stage name "Marla" rehearsed her upcoming show, surrounded by friends and empty soda bottles. Her words were mostly French, but the Ivorian slang and English words that she mixed in made a new language.
To speak only French, "c'est zogo" -- "it's uncool," said Marla, whose real name is Mariam Dosso, combining a French word with Ivorian slang. But playing with words and languages, she said, is "choco," an abbreviation for chocolate meaning "sweet" or "stylish."
A growing number of words and expressions from Africa are now infusing the French language, spurred by booming populations of young people in West and Central Africa.
More than 60 percent of those who speak French daily now live in Africa, and 80 percent of children studying in French are in Africa. There are as many French speakers in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, as in Paris.
Through social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube, they are literally spreading the word, reshaping the French language from African countries, like Ivory Coast, that were once colonized by France.
"We've tried to rap in pure French, but nobody was listening to us," said Jean Patrick Niambé, known as Dofy, a 24-year-old Ivorian hip-hop artist listening to Marla on the rooftop. "So we create words from our own realities, and then they spread."
Walking down the streets of Paris or its suburbs, you can hear people use the word "enjailler" to mean "having fun." But the word originally came from Abidjan to describe how adrenaline-seeking young Ivorians in the 1980s jumped on and off buses racing through the streets.
The youth population in Africa is surging while the rest of the world grays. Demographers predict that by 2060, up to 85 percent of French speakers will live on the African continent. That's nearly the inverse of the 1960s, when 90 percent of French speakers lived in European and other Western countries.
"French flourishes every day in Africa," said Souleymane Bachir Diagne, a renowned Senegalese professor of philosophy and French at Columbia University. "This creolized French finds its way in the books we read, the sketches we watch on television, the songs we listen to."
Nearly half of the countries in Africa were at one time French colonies or protectorates, and most of them use French as their official language.
But France has faced growing resentment in recent years in many of these countries for both its colonial legacy and continuing influence. Some countries have evicted French ambassadors and troops, while others target the French language itself. Some West African novelists write in local languages as an act of artistic resistance. The ruling junta in Mali has stripped French of its official status, and a similar move is underway in Burkina Faso.
The backlash has not gone unnoticed in France, where the evolution of French provokes debate, if not angst, among some intellectuals. President Emmanuel Macron of France said in a 2019 speech: "France must take pride in being essentially one country among others that learns, speaks, writes in French."
The language laboratory
In the sprawling Adjamé market in Abidjan, there are thousands of small stalls selling electronics, clothes, counterfeit medicine and food. The market is a perfect laboratory in which to study Nouchi, a slang once crafted by petty criminals, but which has taken over the country in under four decades.
Some former members of Abidjan's gangs, who helped invent Nouchi, now work as guards patrolling the market's alleys, where "jassa men" -- young hustlers -- sell goods to make ends meet. It is here that new expressions are born and die every day.
Germain-Arsène Kadi, a professor of literature at the Alassane Ouattara University in Ivory Coast, walked deep into the market one morning carrying with him the Nouchi dictionary he wrote.
At a maquis, a street restaurant with plastic tables and chairs, the owner gathered a few jassa men in their corner, or "soï," to throw out their favorite words while they drank Vody, a mix of vodka and energy drink.
"They're going to hit you," the owner said in French, which alarmed me until they explained that the French verb for "hit," frapper, had the opposite meaning there: Those jassa men would treat us well -- which they did, throwing out dozens of words and expressions unknown to me in a few minutes.
Mr. Kadi frantically scribbled down new words on a notepad, saying repeatedly, "One more for the dictionary."
It's nearly impossible to know which word crafted on the streets of Abidjan might spread, travel or even survive.
"Go," meaning "girlfriend" in Ivory Coast, was entered into the well-known French dictionary Le Robert this year.
In Abidjan this year, people began to call a boyfriend "mon pain" -- French for "my bread." Improvisations soon proliferated: "pain choco" is a cute boyfriend. A sugary bread, a sweet one. A bread just out of the oven is a hot partner.
At a church in Abidjan earlier this year, the congregation burst out laughing, several worshipers told me, when the priest preached that people should share their bread with their brethren.
The expression has spread like a meme on social media, reaching neighboring Burkina Faso and the Democratic Republic of Congo, thousands of miles away. It hasn't reached France yet. But Ivorians like to joke about which expressions French people will pick up, often years, if not decades, later.
"If French becomes more mixed, then visions of the world it carries will change," said Josué Guébo, an Ivorian poet and philosopher. "And if Africa influences French from a linguistic point of view, it will likely influence it from an ideological one."
Painful past, uncertain future
Le Magnific -- the stage name for Jacques Silvère Bah -- is one of Ivory Coast's most famous standup comedians, renowned for his plays on words and imitations of West African accents.
But as a young boy learning French in school, he was forbidden to speak Wobé, his own language, he said. His French was initially so poor, he was reduced to communicating with gestures on the playground.
"We had to learn fast, and in a painful way," said the 45-year-old Mr. Silvère one afternoon, before he took the stage at a standup comedy festival in Abidjan.
Across French-speaking West and Central African countries, French is seldom used at home and is rarely the first language, instead restricted to school, work, business or administration.
According to a survey released last year by the French Organization of the Francophonie, the primary organization for promoting French language and culture, 77 percent of respondents in Africa described French as the "language of the colonizer." About 57 percent said it was an imposed language.
Sometimes the methods of imposing it were brutal, scholars say. At school in many French colonies, children speaking in their mother tongue were beaten or forced to wear an object around their necks known as a "symbol" -- often a smelly object or an animal bone.
Still, many African countries adopted French as their official language when they gained independence, in part to cement their national identities. Some even kept the "symbol" in place at school.
At the festival, Le Magnific and other standup comedians threw jibes in French and ridiculed one another's accents, drawing laughter from the audience. It mattered little if a few words were lost in translation.
"What makes our humor Pan-African is the French language," said the festival's organizer, Mohamed Mustapha, known across West Africa by his stage name, Mamane. A standup comedian from Niger, Mamane has a daily comedy program listened to by millions around the world on Radio France Internationale.
"It's about survival, if we want to resist against Nollywood," he said, referring to Nigeria's film industry, "and English-produced content."
Today, more than a third of Ivorians speak French, according to the International Organization of the Francophonie. In Tunisia and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- the world's largest French-speaking country -- it is more than half.
But in many Francophone countries, governments struggle to hire enough French-speaking teachers.
"African children are still learning in French in extremely difficult conditions," said Francine Quéméner, a program specialist in charge of language policies at the International Organization of the Francophonie. "They must learn to count, write, read in a language they don't fully grasp, with teachers who themselves don't always feel secure speaking French."
Still, Ms. Quéméner said French had long escaped France's control.
"French is an African language and belongs to Africans," she said. "The decentralization of the French language is a reality."
France notices
At the Hip Hop Académie, a youth program founded by the rapper Grödash in a Paris suburb, teens and children scribbled lyrics on notepads, following instructions to mix French and foreign languages.
Coumba Soumaré Camara, aged 9, tried out a few words from the mother tongues of her Mauritanian and Senegalese parents. She ended her couplet with "t'es magna" -- you're mean -- combining French syntax and an expression from Mauritania.
Hip-hop, now dominating the French music industry, is injecting new words, phrases and concepts from Africa into France's suburbs and cities.
One of the world's most famous French-speaking pop singers is Aya Nakamura, originally from Mali. Many of the most streamed hip-hop artists are of Moroccan, Algerian, Congolese or Ivorian origins.
"Countless artists have democratized French music with African slang," said Elvis Adidiema, a Congolese music executive with Sony Music Entertainment. "The French public, from all backgrounds, has become accustomed to those sounds."
But some in France are slow to embrace change. Members of the French Academy, the 17th-century institution that publishes an official dictionary of the French language, have been working on the same edition for the past 40 years.
On a recent evening Dany Laferrière, a Haitian-Canadian novelist and the only Black member of the academy, walked the gilded corridors of the Academy's building, on the left bank of the Seine River. He and his fellow academicians were reviewing whether to add to the dictionary the word "yeah," which appeared in French in the 1960s.
Mr. Laferrière acknowledged that the Academy might need to modernize by incorporating entire dictionaries from Belgian, Senegalese, or Ivorian French.
"French is about to make a big leap, and she's wondering how it's going to go," Mr. Laferrière said of the French language. "But she's excited about where she's headed."
He paused, stared at the Seine through the window, and corrected himself.
"They, not she. They are now multiple versions of French that speak for themselves. And that is the greatest proof of its vitality."

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast — French, by most estimates the world’s fifth most spoken language, is changing — perhaps not in the gilded hallways of the institution in Paris that publishes its official dictionary, but on a rooftop in Abidjan, the largest city in Ivory Coast.

Full text: Series like "The Bear," "Beef," "Happy Valley," "Reservation Dogs" and "Succession" dazzled in a year when much of the TV business was in disarray.
Best Shows of 2023 | Best International | Best Shows That Ended
Best Shows of 2023
TV in 2023 was like synchronized swimming. Below the surface, there was roiling and churn. The writers' and actors' strikes wiped out much of the production year. The hangover from the corporate binge on streaming platforms led to cancellations and cutbacks. A number of hall-of-fame series left the air, with no clear plan of, as it were, succession.
But above the waterline, the dance went on. As usual, it was challenging to whittle down my year-end list to 10. (So I picked 11.) As usual, I am listing it in alphabetical, not ranked order. As usual, I made it a rule not to repeat shows from the previous year, and as usual, I broke that rule. (I couldn't not include "Reservation Dogs.")
And as usual, I probably missed stuff: I have the same number of hours in the day as you, even if I spend more of them in front of a screen. Herewith, the best of what I did see, for your catching-up pleasure. Even if Peak TV is dead, Off-Peak TV should keep us plenty busy.
'The Bear' (FX)
When "The Americans" was on the air, I used to say that it was good it came first on my list alphabetically, because it was probably the series I would rank No. 1 if pushed. Now "The Bear" has that pride of place (at least until "Abbott Elementary" makes it back on my list). After a much-hyped 2022 premiere, the restaurant dramedy leveled up, exploring the volcanic dysfunction of its central family and celebrating the care and feeding of guests as a quasi-spiritual calling. This show is cooking with gas. (Streaming on Hulu.)
'Beef' (Netflix)
"Beef" was a good story about people getting mad: Amy Lau (Ali Wong) and Danny Cho (Steven Yeun), whose road-rage encounter descends into a quagmire of terrible choices. But it was a great story about why people get mad. It peeled the blazing onion of their conflict to expose class differences, family resentments and inter- and intragroup tensions among its Asian American characters, in an unsparing but empathetic telling. A big enough collection of last straws, "Beef" said, can build a highly flammable house. (Streaming on Netflix.)
'The Curse' (Showtime)
Like the mirrored eco-houses that its two lead characters build, "The Curse" is a polarizing creation. The collaboration between Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie, with a stunning performance by Emma Stone, is deeply uncomfortable. It is also an entrancing, original, astute, creepy -- and funny! -- study of guilt, marriage and benighted altruism. Enter this haunted house if you dare, but watch your step. (Streaming on Paramount+.)
'Dead Ringers' (Amazon Prime Video)
We'd have been just fine without so many remakes, reboots and adaptations in 2023. "Dead Ringers" was a bloody, brilliant exception. Rachel Weisz -- playing twin gynecologists in a gender-swapped version of the Jeremy Irons film role -- and the writer Alice Birch delivered a truly distinctive reimagining of this story that kept the body horror while adding a contemporary take on scientific hubris and big-money medicine. (Streaming on Amazon Prime Video.)
'I'm a Virgo' (Amazon Prime Video)
Boots Riley's Brobdingnagian satire was both fabulistic and fabulous. Through the misadventures and explorations of Cootie (a marvelous Jharrel Jerome), a 13-foot-tall teen in Oakland, Riley personified the idea of the young Black man as threat, while spinning a wild, political and relentlessly entertaining tale that incorporated superhero mythology and anticapitalist critique. The series strained to control its outsized ambitions, but it was proof that you can never aim too big. (Streaming on Amazon Prime Video.)
'Jury Duty' (Amazon Freevee)
Like a jury summons, this innovative reality-comedy was a surprise. But in this case, it was a pleasant one. An unsuspecting citizen, Ronald Gladden, was called to serve on a fictional case, joining a jury of his fake peers played by actors (as well as the actor James Marsden, playing himself). Miraculously, the production pulled off the elaborate "trial" without blowing its cover. And marvelously, what might have sounded like a cruel joke turned out to be a feel-good, hilarious test of decency, in which Gladden, er, acquitted himself with charm and integrity. (Streaming on Amazon Freevee.)
'The Last of Us' and 'Somebody Somewhere' (HBO)
You might think that a thriller about a fungal zombie apocalypse has nothing in common with a slice-of-life account of friendships, queer life and cabaret music. But these very different HBO series showcased two of 2023's great duos. (Each of them involving a Joel!) In "Last of Us," Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey starred as Joel and Ellie, an odd couple forced to consider what they would sacrifice for endangered humanity. Season 2 of "Somewhere" tested the bond of Sam (Bridget Everett) and Joel (Jeff Hiller) in an endearing story of heartland eccentrics. One series splattered more guts than the other, but each had heart to spare. (Streaming on Max.)
'Reservation Dogs' (FX)
It is fitting that the final season of this comedy, set on a Native reservation in Oklahoma, had a story line involving extraterrestrial life. This was a story of a small community that, over its three seasons, managed to fill an entire universe. A rare coming-of-age story that does as well by its elder characters as its young leads, it left me with my heart brimming and my eyes wanting more. (Streaming on Hulu.)
'South Side' (Max)
What is a "year," really? Yes, eagle-eyed readers will note that the final season of this comedy aired at the end of 2022, but it arrived too late for my previous list. Over a too-short, three-season run, "South Side" expanded a workplace comedy about a Chicago rent-to-own shop into a fantastical universe of eccentrics, scammers and hapless police and pols, and the final season packed years' worth of ideas into a final blaze of surreal world-building. This was one for the ages, even if it lived on borrowed -- or rented -- time. (Streaming on Max.)
'Succession' (HBO)
Like the Roy family empire, the final season of this corporate saga dominated all available media. But the saturation coverage was deserved. The drama followed its dark instincts to the end, giving a send-off for the ages to the patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and living up to its title in his heirs fight for his legacy. The C-suite brawl -- in which American democracy was collateral damage -- managed to be cynically satisfying and deeply emotional. Money could not buy the Roys happiness, but their misery was priceless. (Streaming on Max.)
Honorable mention: "Barry" (HBO); "Blue Eye Samurai" (Netflix); "Dave" (FXX); "Happy Valley" (BBC America); "How To With John Wilson" (HBO); "I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson" (Netflix); "Killing It" (Peacock); "Minx" (Starz); "Mrs. Davis" (Peacock); "Party Down" (Starz); "Scavengers Reign" (Max); "The Traitors" (Peacock).

Best International Shows
It cannot be overemphasized: The wild proliferation of series, especially imported ones, makes the word "best" at the top of any list a hazy approximation at, you know, best. Here are 10 shows from outside the United States, in alphabetical order, that I particularly enjoyed in 2023.
'A Spy Among Friends' (MGM+)
This languorous yet nail-biting variation on the espionage thriller dramatized the end of the friendship between Kim Philby, the British spy who was a double agent for the Soviets, and Nicholas Elliott, the fellow spy sent to bring Philby home and then suspected of treason himself when Philby escaped. Written by Alex Cary ("Homeland") based on Ben Macintyre's book, it was a smart and complicated puzzle play and an icy dissection of the British class system; most of all, it was a tour de force for Guy Pearce as Philby, Damian Lewis as Elliott and Anna Maxwell Martin as a fictional agent caught in the middle. (Streaming on MGM+.)
'C.B. Strike' (Max)
The rapport between Tom Burke, as the gruff British private eye Cormoran Strike, and Holliday Grainger, as his assistant and then fellow investigator Robin Ellacott, has always been more than enough reason to watch this series based on J.K. Rowling's Strike mystery novels (written under the name Robert Galbraith). The show's balance of detection and thorny, soulful friendship-cum-romance is close to ideal; the fifth season, based on Rowling's book "Troubled Blood," combined a cluster of family crises with a deft, surprising mystery involving the 40-year-old case of a missing doctor. (Streaming on Max.)
'Happy Valley' (BBC America)
Sally Wainwright's intimate, everyday epic about the life-or-death struggle between a Yorkshire police officer and her nemesis, the blandly brutal sociopath who was also the father of her grandson, reached its reckoning in its third and final season. Sarah Lancashire and James Norton were terrific to the end, along with Siobhan Finneran as the cop's ruinously, redemptively softhearted sister. (Streaming on AMC+ and Acorn TV.)
'Oshi no Ko' (Hidive)
From idol singing groups to TV dramas, reality-dating shows, anime musicals, modeling, YouTube stardom, performing-arts high schools, celebrity journalism and online trolling, this animated series offers an almost documentary-style account of the wages of success in the Japanese entertainment industry. Because it is a sprightly, goofy anime, its darkly earnest accounts of struggle and exploitation share space with teenage romance and a murder mystery, and its hero and heroine are a young doctor and his teenage patient reincarnated as the twin babies of a pop singer they both idolized. (Streaming on Hidive.)
'Paris Police 1905' (MHz Choice)
The latest winner from the French network Canal+ (progenitor of "Spiral" and "The Bureau") is a police procedural that doubles as a panorama of French society at a time when overwhelming change barrels into ossified conservatism and privilege. (The first season was titled "Paris Police 1900.") The plot of the new season of this highly entertaining melodrama, which matches a grisly sang-froid with the driest humor, is driven by syphilis, homophobia and a deadly new menace, the automobile. (Streaming on MHz Choice.)
'Slow Horses' (Apple TV+)
The second season of this wonderfully sardonic British series about a cadre of misfit, career-stalled MI5 agents (which premiered on Dec. 2, 2022, after last year's edition of these lists appeared) was, if anything, better than the first -- its mystery twistier, its action more tense and shocking. Season 3, premiering Wednesday, is a slight step back -- the bullet count goes way up, which is always a bad sign -- but the average of the two seasons is still awfully high. (Streaming on Apple TV+.)
'Somewhere Boy' (Hulu)
In its flashbacks, this compact drama is a dark fable: a bereaved Welsh husband, terrified of also losing his young son, keeps the boy captive by telling him that the world outside their isolated home is populated by monsters. In the present, it's an astringent coming-of-age story, as Danny (Lewis Gribben), now nearly an adult, emerges into the confusing, disappointing, equally frightening real world. Gribben and Samuel Bottomley, as the cousin suddenly saddled with being Danny's protector, are excellent. (Streaming on Hulu.)
'30 Coins' (Max)
"It's all quite incomprehensible," a character says of events in the second season of Álex de la Iglesia's apocalyptic theological thriller. "But life is incomprehensible, too." That's the correct spirit in which to watch de la Iglesia's rococo riot of a series about a handful of ordinary, though in some cases extraordinarily attractive people -- a small-town mayor, a veterinarian, a lapsed cop, a YouTube ghostbuster -- battling Satan, the Vatican, Paul Giamatti (as an L. Ron Hubbard-style cult leader) and possibly God over the fate of the world. (Streaming on Max.)
'Wolf Like Me' (Peacock)
Abe Forsythe's charming, sometimes extremely bloody Australian dramedy is a moving and tartly comic account of a blended family in which part of the blend is a werewolf. Isla Fisher is enormously appealing as the no-nonsense, highly suspicious wolf, Mary, who spent the second season pregnant by her lumpenly human boyfriend (Josh Gad); the season-ending cliffhanger promises to radically change the show. (Streaming on Peacock.)
'Yosi, the Regretful Spy' (Amazon Prime Video)
The Argentine writer and director Daniel Burman based this absorbing drama on the true story of a government agent who infiltrated the Jewish community of Buenos Aires in the years leading up to the horrific terrorist bombings that targeted that community in the early 1990s. Through two seasons, its depiction of the automatic, paranoiac anti-Semitism of the country's establishment is all the more chilling for being utterly matter-of-fact. (Streaming on Amazon Prime Video.)
Best Shows That Ended
This year brought a few banner finales and a few shows unjustly cut off in their primes, some slow fades and some purposeful but (to a fan) premature endings. So goes my lament each year.
To qualify for my list, arranged below in alphabetical order, shows had to air in 2023 (or just about) and also officially end; renewal limbo is the enemy of the fan and the list-maker alike. Miniseries and limited series did not count (God bless, though), and I considered shows in toto, not just their final runs.
'Barry' (HBO)
Bill Hader cocreated, starred in and directed most of this assassin black comedy, which was among television's most brooding and violent shows but still bubbled over with snappy one-liners and zippy satire. The show's virtuosic action sequences and fight choreography were only part of its appeal, though. Barry discovering a love of and aptitude for acting; his relationship with his grandiose mentor, Gene (Henry Winkler); his abusive romance with Sally (Sarah Goldberg) -- all of these marvelous facets refracted light through a dark gem. (Streaming on Max.)
'Doom Patrol' (Max)
The first two seasons of this show are much better than the second two, but, man, they are a ton of fun. While a lot of comic book fare is trite, didactic and redundant, "Doom" was raucous, silly, arch -- but with a fairy-tale wistfulness and a real, beating heart. It was filthy and funny, and not particularly attached to always making sense, full of a vibrant strangeness that allowed for both immature humor and richly depicted sorrow and longing. (Streaming on Max.)
'The Great' (Hulu)
Few shows, if any, wring as much from each fiber of their existence as "The Great" did: Every line, every gesture, every hat, every plate conveyed something rich and thrilling, a ballerina telling an entire tragedy through the tilt of her pinkie. Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult cultivated an electrified sense of menace and then a real but twisted love between Catherine the Great and Peter III. So many period dramas just feel like inert, expensive Wikipedia entries, but "The Great," through its irreverence and artistry, was alive at every turn. (Streaming on Hulu.)
'Happy Valley' (BBC America)
"Happy Valley" debuted in 2014, when the bleak foreign crime show was more in fashion, but it was never strictly a misery-murder show. Sarah Lancashire starred as Catherine Cawood, a police sergeant in West Yorkshire still tormented by her daughter's suicide and raising her grandson in the shadow of that grief. Where lots of sad cop shows flatten their characters, "Valley" always sought depth and fullness -- characters make jokes, the relationships have texture, choices have emotional heft. (Streaming on AMC+ and Acorn TV.)
'How To With John Wilson' (HBO)
This mesmerizing collage series always felt maybe a little too fragile for this harsh world, its tender musings and awkward but reverential curiosity leading to moments of human resonance that were so lovely they were almost painful. John Wilson reassembled his obsessive catalogs of New York City (and occasionally elsewhere) into poems about yearning, growing, belonging, changing -- all these snippets of minutiae that would add up to a beautiful, illuminating gut punch. The end of this show stings harder than most because there won't ever be anything else quite like it. (Streaming on Max.)
'The Other Two' (Max)
Over its three seasons, "The Other Two" was thrillingly catty and cynical while keeping a tiny ember of sweetness burning all the way through. Heléne Yorke and Drew Tarver starred as the older siblings to a teeny-bopper idol who each crave the spotlight in their own ways, too. The show loved mocking their thirst for fame and especially ridiculing the hollowness of much of the entertainment industry and media. The Season 3 episode about a play called "8 Gay Men with AIDS: A Poem in Many Hours" is a particular treat. (Streaming on Max.)
'Reservation Dogs' (FX)
"Reservation Dogs" was so suffused with death and absence, maybe I shouldn't feel so aggrieved that it is ending after just three seasons. Maybe I should internalize one of the central ideas of the show, that the end of a life is not the end of a relationship. Maybe someday I will be that sanguine, but for now, I'm still bummed out! In its short run, this coming-of-age series about Native American teens in Oklahoma was as gorgeous, surprising and nimble as TV gets -- funny and whimsical, daring and important. (Streaming on Hulu.)
'Single Drunk Female' (Freeform)
This is one of our unjustly canceled specimens this year, a show cut off mid-blossom. In Season 1, we met Sam (Sofia Black-D'Elia) as she hit rock bottom, moved home with her difficult mother, joined Alcoholics Anonymous and tried to crawl out of her despair. In Season 2, the show, like Sam, found its footing, and its warm approach made grim themes accessible to Freeform's younger audience and to anyone drained by sad-coms who still wanted something with depth. Adding insult to injury, Disney, which owns Freeform, also pulled the show off its streaming platforms. (Buy it on Amazon Prime Video.)
'South Side' (Max)
This is our asterisk entry this year -- "South Side" did not air in 2023, but its third and final season aired in December 2022, after last year's list went to print, and its cancellation wasn't official until February of this year. So it is sneaking through on multiple technicalities. Also because it was so dang funny, with among the highest jokes-per-minute rate of any contemporary show. The show, set on the South Side of Chicago, had one of the most fully developed worlds on television, where characters who were onscreen for only a line or two still felt woven in. (Streaming on Max.)
'Succession' (HBO)
I mean ... it's "Succession." Bury me in its fine textiles and viciousness, its fascinating ability to depict its characters as piñatas filled with more emptiness, its filthy rejoinders and knack for detail. A show this grand had to go out big, too, and killing off Logan not as its denouement but rather as its 11 o'clock number gave its final batch of episodes a swirling urgency. (Streaming on Max.)
Honorable mention: "A Black Lady Sketch Show" (HBO); "Miracle Workers" (TBS); "Painting With John" (HBO); "Sex Education" (Netflix); "Summer Camp Island" (Cartoon Network).

Immersive Action In Imagined Worlds: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There was an embarrassment of riches from legacy role-playing franchises, beloved horror series and innovative newcomers.
The return of beloved characters along with ambitious new titles turned this year into one of the video game industry's best, leaving players with an embarrassment of riches.
Even during traditionally sleepy months, players had the opportunity to navigate the galaxies of Starfield, embark on the high-fantasy adventures of Baldur's Gate 3 and battle the monstrous forces of Diablo IV. Long development cycles and a willingness to take risks with gameplay and narrative paid off creatively during what was a grueling season of layoffs, mergers and cutbacks within the industry.
Despite those setbacks, video games remain an innovative sector of culture, with critics giving this year's slate of releases the best review scores in the past 20 years. These games, listed in alphabetical order, excelled at providing players with immersive experiences.
Alan Wake 2
Weirdness should be rewarded, and the Finnish developers at Remedy Entertainment have clearly embraced the edges of what players can expect from a survival horror game. The offbeat style that concerned publishers when the original game released in 2010 returns in this sequel about an author of crime thrillers who keeps treading between fact and fiction, where the lines between reality and illusion blur. Players will find themselves solving murders and dodging bullets, only to later enjoy an extended musical act by a live-action band called the Old Gods of Asgard. (PC, Sony PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)
Baldur's Gate 3
The developers at Larian Studios in Belgium engineered a love letter to the tabletop Dungeons & Dragons series that prioritizes customizability and surprise. The vampires, shape-shifters, dwarves and goblins that populate the world of Baldur's Gate 3 regularly deliver zingers that make every moment of this titanic story a joy to experience. Online multiplayer has also made this game a fan favorite, with dozens of streamers broadcasting their successes and failures to a growing community. (PC, PS5)
Chants of Sennaar
A shrouded figure emerges from a coffin, navigating a series of dungeon puzzles whose instructions are written in a language that players cannot decipher -- yet. Chants of Sennaar, from the French developer Rundisc, is a wonderfully inventive game that plays on the idea of being lost in translation. The cel-shaded artistic direction seems to evoke the Moorish influences of the palace of Alhambra, creating a meditative maze of castles and gardens that hides a darker secret. The disorientation forces players to rely on a pictorial journal where images and words are connected into a makeshift lexicon. Building that dictionary feels like mastering a new language. (Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
Dave the Diver
Sushi and scuba are only appetizers in this oddball game from the South Korean developer Mintrocket that is set in an oceanside haunt, where a giant octopus is terrifying the local fishermen. That is the first of many mysteries awaiting Dave, an unlikely hero who becomes a seaside MacGyver responsible for running a restaurant and overseeing several farms. He also moonlights as a social media manager, sea horse trainer and underwater archaeologist. (PC, Switch)
Final Fantasy XVI
The flagship franchise of the Japanese developer Square Enix was going through something of an identity crisis -- what exactly defines a Final Fantasy title? -- when the 16th mainline entry arrived. This one takes place in a high-fantasy setting, where kingdoms scheme against one another in a war inspired by the HBO series "Game of Thrones." The resulting epic contains a tragic hero's quest but also mundane side quests spent retrieving wildflowers and other meaningless items. Elements of political intrigue and a subplot involving enslaved magic bearers are eventually overshadowed by an evil god and behemoths known as eikons that lead the protagonist into fights recalling the showdowns between Godzilla and Mothra. But even within its messy later acts, there are shimmers of brilliance found in every Final Fantasy title. (PS5)
The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
A direct sequel to Breath of the Wild, one of the most celebrated games of the past decade, created high expectations for Nintendo. The resulting adventure saw the industrial revolution come to Hyrule, where players learned to combine relics scattered across the ruined kingdom into motorcycles and airplanes. Tears of the Kingdom slightly disappointed those craving more narrative depth from the series, but the Japanese team's inventive approach to environmental puzzles remains unparalleled. Trusting players to conquer open-ended challenges with a seemingly infinite number of solutions (and roads to failure) has kept The Legend of Zelda one of the industry's biggest franchises. (Switch)
Pikmin 4
There have been substantial changes to the Pikmin formula in what might be considered a reboot for the Nintendo series, which has struggled to find a mainstream audience. This entry stands out by streamlining mechanics and combining some of the best features of the first three games, which focus on leading armies of Pikmin -- alien plant creatures -- to multiply their numbers, collect treasures and battle local invasive species. All the action happens from the ground level as players navigate a crew of space explorers no larger than ants. (Switch)
Resident Evil 4
When it started revisiting older games in its Resident Evil catalog, the Japanese developer Capcom knew that expectations for one particular entry would be preposterously high. Since its release in the mid-2000s, Resident Evil 4 has been considered by some as one of the greatest video games ever released. The remake is a reminder of why the horror series reigns supreme, bringing new features and unexpected jump scares. A balance of bloody horror and campy jokes from the protagonist, Leon Kennedy, almost softens the sheer terror of zombie villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite chasing you through the countryside of Spain. (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S)
Spider-Man 2
The developers at Insomniac Games, an American studio, were poised to deliver more of the same after its 2018 game Spider-Man seemed to perfect the gameplay loop of a web-slinging superhero with a realistic map of Manhattan to explore. Players were left to happily swing across the city long after they completed the main story. Its sequel delivered more of the same while improving on some of its predecessor's rough edges. The superhero has extended his jurisdiction to Brooklyn and Queens, more villains are destroying the skyline, and a partnership between Peter Parker and Miles Morales becomes strained as the elder Spidey's mind is corrupted by the alien evildoer Venom. (PS5)
Viewfinder
Playing this game will open your third eye. The puzzles involve perspective-shifting gimmicks that employ trick photography to distort time and space. Developers at the Scottish company Sad Owl Studios have players use a camera to open rifts in the environment, resulting in worlds that sometimes look ripped from an M.C. Escher illustration. Taking some of its ambience and thematic cues from other prestigious puzzlers -- including Portal (2007), The Witness (2016) and Superliminal (2019) -- Viewfinder does not overstay its welcome, leaving players eager to dive farther into its world's many mysteries.

A Character-Driven Approach to Diversifying Fiction: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Alter, Alexandra

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Her solution? A packaging business that sells ideas for commercial genre fiction featuring characters from broadly diverse backgrounds.
One evening this fall, a crowd of writers and publishing professionals mingled in a speakeasy-style lounge in Midtown Manhattan. The party, hosted by a new company called Electric Postcard Entertainment, was the kind of lavish affair that's become rare for the book business in an era of corporate consolidation and cuts.
Guests traded industry gossip and sipped potent signature cocktails with names like "timeless love" and "immortality serum" -- phrases that alluded to the company's coming romance and fantasy projects. The crowd included executives from Sony, film agents and producers, book scouts, novelists and editors and publicists from publishing houses like Macmillan, Simon & Schuster and William Morrow.
The company's sales pitch was delivered stealthily via gift bags stuffed with candles, a branded sweatshirt and tea. Along with the party swag was a small sealed envelope holding a plastic card with a QR code that led to a website, where excerpts from 10 of the company's new book projects were posted. There was a lesbian time-travel romance, a novel about an immortal Black travel writer who wanders the globe for centuries and a fantasy about the epic rivalry between two prominent Black families who wield magic.
The stories hadn't yet been fully written -- these were teasers for potential books, and Electric Postcard, which generated those book ideas, was looking for buyers. A note on the site urged interested parties to contact New Leaf Literary & Media, an agency that represents Electric Postcard's projects.
The mastermind behind those fictional plots and dozens more is Dhonielle Clayton -- a former librarian whose hyperactive imagination has spawned a prolific factory for intellectual property. Though her name doesn't always appear on the covers of the books she conceives, she has quietly become an influential power broker in the book world.
"She's like a puppet master," said the best-selling novelist Jason Reynolds, who attended the party and is a longtime friend of Ms. Clayton's. "People don't know Dhonielle's hand is in everything."
In addition to running Electric Postcard, which she founded last year, Ms. Clayton is the president of Cake Creative, another packaging company that develops intellectual property for children's books, and the author of more than a dozen novels.
Like other packagers, Ms. Clayton, 40, comes up with plots for potential novels and hires writers to execute those ideas, then sells the books to publishers. Packagers have been a fixture of the publishing industry for decades, and have engineered hits like "Gossip Girl," "The Vampire Diaries" and "Pretty Little Liars." By farming out ideas to writers but holding onto the copyright, packagers can build up large and lucrative catalogs of intellectual property. While some offer authors a cut of the advance and royalties, allowing them to share in a book's success, others pay only a negotiated fee, which can range from a few thousand dollars to the low tens of thousands.
But Ms. Clayton has bigger ambitions, and set out to create a different kind of packaging company. She's aiming to create a pipeline for fiction featuring racially diverse and L.G.B.T.Q. protagonists, as well as characters living with disabilities, and who come from diverse religious and cultural backgrounds, to convince publishers that those stories can be commercial blockbusters. She works exclusively with writers from marginalized communities, and aims to give her authors a fair cut of the pay, and the tools to have their own careers.
In an industry that's long had a diversity problem, Ms. Clayton has sometimes struggled to get publishers on board. She's received countless rejections, and has heard many variations of the argument that books centered on people of color don't sell. But in the past decade, her packaging business has sold 57 books; 41 of which have been sold since 2020. Nine projects have been optioned for TV and film. Many of the 26 writers who have worked with Ms. Clayton have gone on to sign deals for books based on their own ideas, she said.
Graduates include rising stars like Kwame Mbalia, who started his own imprint at Disney after his "Tristan Strong" fantasy series became a best seller in 2019. Another Cake protégé, Nick Brooks, wrote "Promise Boys," a campus murder mystery about a group of Black and El Salvadoran students wrongly accused of killing their principal, based on Ms. Clayton's idea. The book, which came out earlier this year, sold to Henry Holt for a seven-figure sum. It was optioned by Netflix, with Temple Hill Entertainment and Higher Ground, Barack and Michelle Obama's production company, signed on as producers, and Mr. Brooks attached as a writer.
Brian Geffen, an executive editor at Henry Holt Books for Young Readers, said he was hooked when Cake sent him a splashy audiobook sample for "Promise Boys" that had multiple narrators and sound effects. He bought the book, based on a sample and an outline, in a competitive auction. "I'm not the type of editor who loves to buy off a sample, but we ended up making a sizable investment in the book," Mr. Geffen said. Part of what gave him confidence in the project was Ms. Clayton's involvement, he said. "Dhonielle's reputation preceded her."
The Industry's Diversity Problem
Like many corners of the entertainment world, the book business has long been, and remains, overwhelmingly white. Authors of color frequently find they get paid less than their white peers, and that publishers don't invest as much in marketing their books, hampering their sales.
While there's been a push to change that over the years, progress has been painfully slow. White workers accounted for 76 percent of publishing industry employees at more than 150 companies, including publishing houses, agencies and literary journals, a 2019 survey conducted by Lee & Low Books showed (their next report is due in early 2024).
In 2020, after the killing of George Floyd ignited protests around the country, publishers faced growing pressure to make publishing more inclusive. Major publishing houses hired and promoted editors from racially diverse backgrounds and created new imprints dedicated to works by writers of color. Editors rushed to sign up books by Black authors and acquired titles that explored race and racism, many of which sold well.
While there aren't current industrywide statistics on the racial backgrounds of U.S. authors, recent reports from two of the country's biggest publishers show both significant strides and a lingering racial imbalance. In a recently released diversity report, Penguin Random House, the largest publishing house in the United States, said that an audit of its publishing programs from 2019 to 2021 found that some 75 percent of its authors were white. Similarly, Hachette Book Group reported this spring that while acquisitions of books by nonwhite authors and illustrators increased 20 percent between 2019 and 2022, white authors and artists accounted for 76 percent of the books the company purchased in 2022.
Some in the industry are now worried that publishers' commitment to diverse books has stalled.
"I do feel like the enthusiasm has left the building," said Rockelle Henderson, who worked at big publishing houses for 16 years and now runs Rock Inked Incorporated, a marketing and literary agency. "When you go to sell something, they're like, oh no, we've tried that, or the market is saturated."
Publishers have also been thrown off by sluggish sales this year, a decline that followed the surge in books sales during the height of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. As a result, some are reluctant to take a chance on titles that aren't guaranteed sellers, and are pouring more money into sure bets like celebrity memoirs and upmarket women's fiction.
"The perception is still that when a book by a writer of color works, it's an aberration," said Ayesha Pande, the founder of the Ayesha Pande Literary agency. "The entire industry is still very much set up to publish books by white creators -- that's what they're good at, that's what they know how to do."
"Everything else, they consider to be a risk," she added.
Some publishers that raced to diversify their lists then saw disappointing sales for some titles are now falling back on the old arguments that such books don't resonate widely -- a standard that doesn't seem to apply to white writers, Ms. Clayton said.
"A lot of writers are struggling to break through again," she said.
She's saved every rejection note, both to study the patterns and to keep a record.
"I'm a librarian, I'm an archivist," she said. "I have the receipts."
Writing What She Wanted to Read
Growing up in Maryland, Ms. Clayton was, by her own account, "a little nerd, a bookworm with thick glasses, like a fussy little cat." Much of the time, she would hide under the dining room table and read -- devouring classics like "Harriet the Spy," "The Phantom Tollbooth," "Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry," "A Wrinkle in Time."
After teaching English in Washington, D.C., and Maryland, in 2010, she moved to New York, where she enrolled in a children's literature program at the New School, and worked as a librarian at a charter school in Harlem, where she lives now. She struggled to find engaging books for her students, who mostly belonged to immigrant communities from the Caribbean, Central and South America, West Africa and Bangladesh. Many of the books she could find that featured characters from diverse backgrounds were older titles, many of them about topics like slavery or segregation.
"I thought, this is incredibly unfair. An entire portion of a generation of children are being underserved, and it's affecting their relationship to words," she said. "And so I was like, you know what? I've got to write."
She wrote the kind of fiction she wanted to read -- action-packed fantasies and mysteries -- but it felt like writing into a void.
"At the time, books that featured characters of color or marginalized characters were pigeonholed into multicultural literature, they were teachable lessons," she said.
She wrote eight novels before selling her 2015 debut, the young adult novel "Tiny Pretty Things" -- a murder mystery set at a ballet school, where a Black ballerina struggles to fit in. Ms. Clayton co-wrote it with Sona Charaipotra, a writer she met at the New School.
A few years later, she published her first solo title, "The Belles," a suspenseful fairy tale that spawned a young adult fantasy series, and went on to publish 10 more novels.
Though her books were well received, the pay was often modest. For the first decade of her career, all of her advances were less than $ 30,000.
In the years that she was struggling to break in as a novelist, Ms. Clayton started looking for other ways to change the industry. She had learned about book packaging while interning with a literary agency, and saw it as a way to create a sustainable supply chain for the kinds of books she wanted her students to be able to read.
She teamed up with Ms. Charaipotra, and in 2011 they co-founded the packager Cake Creative, with the aim of changing the children's book landscape.
Ms. Clayton's manic creative energy made her well-suited to running a packaging company, said Ms. Charaipotra, who left the company a few years ago to focus on her own work. She sold her stake to Ms. Clayton.
"She has 100 ideas going at any given moment," she said.
A New Model for Book Packaging
From the outset, Ms. Clayton and Ms. Charaipotra decided that Cake would be different from other packagers, which have mixed reputations. At some companies, writers are sometimes treated like interchangeable cogs, expected to write under a pseudonym, or in some cases, getting pushed out after creating a successful series, which are then kept going under their name by ghostwriters.
At Cake, rather than maintaining a stable of writers, they made it a priority to help authors pursue their own book ideas. They also offered writers a percentage cut of the book advance and royalties, rather than just a flat fee, and paid for writing they did on spec.
Ms. Clayton and New Leaf, the literary agency that represents her companies' projects, declined to share the terms of their author contracts, but said that in addition to getting a percentage share of the book advance and royalties, writers get a cut of subsidiary rights like audiobook and translation rights, and bonuses if the screen rights are optioned and a movie or series is made.
To find promising new writers, the company puts call-outs on social media, gets referrals through Ms. Clayton's extensive network of authors, and sifts through writing samples that are submitted through a form on the company's website.
Their authors are put through a rigorous writing boot camp, with coaching on plot structure, character development, dialogue, pacing and genre conventions. They are taught how to read a deal sheet, how to assess the terms in a contract, how to take feedback from editors and what to expect from marketing and publicity.
"It shouldn't have taken me eight books, start to finish, to break in," Ms. Clayton said. "I wanted to shorten the runway for other people."
For the first few years of Cake's existence, Ms. Clayton found herself up against some of the same barriers that she'd faced as a Black author trying to land book deals. Publishers seemed skeptical of her argument that diverse books could reach a wide audience.
"The types of rejections that I was receiving were, 'We already have a book about a Black girl. We already have an Asian book," she said.
Those attitudes, once common, began to look increasingly outdated, as teachers, librarians and authors started lobbying for books that served the needs of a diverse readership. Anger at publishers boiled over in 2014, fueled by an event at a publishing trade convention featuring children's book luminaries. The event lineup included only white authors, and Grumpy Cat, the feline social media star.
"That was the diversity," Ms. Clayton recalled. "Grumpy Cat."
For many in the industry, it felt like a breaking point. Publishers faced mounting pressure to make children's literature more inclusive, and eventually, word got out that Ms. Clayton had a knack for spotting talent and was developing a catalog of books with a diversity of themes. After years of rejections, people started coming to Ms. Clayton.
Some of the publishing industry's biggest stars began seeking out her ideas and her network of writers. In 2018, Rick Riordan, the author of the blockbuster "Heroes of Olympus" Greek mythology-based fantasy series, started a new imprint at Disney. Mr. Riordan was looking for authors who could write middle-grade novels based on myths and fables from different cultures, and he wanted to publish a series centered on African American folklore.
Ms. Clayton came up with a fantasy world where Black folk heroes like John Henry have heroic powers. Kwame Mbalia, an unpublished writer in North Carolina who was working as a pharmaceutical metrologist, inspecting equipment for drug manufacturers, learned from a sci-fi and fantasy writing Slack channel that Cake was looking for a Black writer for a project, and sent in a writing sample. Ms. Clayton hired him to write the book, and Mr. Mbalia embellished her idea, creating a story about a Black boy named Tristan Strong who stumbles into a magical world filled with folklore figures like Gum Baby, Anansi, and other figures from African American and African legends. Disney bought two books based on three chapters and an outline.
After "Tristan Strong Punches a Hole in the Sky" came out in 2019, it drew starred reviews and became a New York Times best seller, and won a Coretta Scott King Award, a prestigious prize given to Black children's book authors and illustrators. Disney turned it into a trilogy, and eventually offered Mr. Mbalia his own imprint, Freedom Fire Books. Its first three titles are due out next year.
Mr. Mbalia said he sometimes questioned how much of the "Tristan Strong" story he could take credit for, since Cake created the concept and holds the copyright. When he brought that up with Ms. Clayton over dinner one evening, she assured him that he made the story his own.
"I remember her being like, this is your story," he said. "You wrote this. Only you could write this."
"I Have Zero Grace About It"
In 2020, when there was a renewed push to diversify the industry, Ms. Clayton got a few offers to start her own imprint at a publishing house.
Instead, she decided to expand her business into adult genre fiction. She came up with the idea for Electric Postcard, developing intellectual property for the adult market, which has been slower to diversify than children's literature.
To compensate for her own creative blind spots, she brought in four other novelists as collaborators and book idea generators, including Zoraida Córdova, who writes romance and fantasy; Tiffany D. Jackson, who writes thrillers and horror; Gretchen McNeil, who writes horror and suspense; and Natalie C. Parker, who writes horror and fantasy.
They all meet regularly over Zoom to pitch projects and go on annual brainstorming retreats. So far, the company has sold 11 books since it was founded last fall.
But there are still hurdles. Ms. Clayton has been disheartened, though not entirely surprised, to see enthusiasm for diverse books dissipate among some publishers, and to be told once again that the market for such works is marginal.
"I have zero grace about it," she said.
Her mood lifted when she started listing some of the book ideas she thought of that now sit on bookstore and library shelves: "The Gauntlet," a series about a Bangladeshi Muslim girl who gets trapped in a magic board game; "Love Sugar Magic," a fantasy series about a family of Mexican American witches; "Last Gate of the Emperor," an Afrofuturist adventure set in a mythical Ethiopian empire.
"They all come from my brain," she said. "And they all come from the students that walked into my library. I'm making books for those people."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the producer of "All in the Family" and many other shows, Mr. Lear showed that it was possible to be topical, funny and immensely popular.
Norman Lear, the television writer and producer who introduced political and social commentary into situation comedy with "All in the Family" and other shows, proving that it was possible to be topical as well as funny while attracting millions of viewers, died on Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 101.
A spokeswoman for the family, Lara Bergthold, confirmed the death.
Mr. Lear reigned at the top of the television world through the 1970s and into the early '80s, leaving a lasting mark with shows that brought the sitcom into the real world.
"The Jeffersons" looked at the struggles faced by an upwardly mobile Black family; a very different Black family on "Good Times" dealt with poverty and discrimination. The protagonist of "Maude" was an outspoken feminist; the heroine of "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" was plagued by all manner of modern-day problems, not least her own neurosis.
"You looked around television in those years," Mr. Lear said in a 2012 New York Times interview, referring to the middle and late 1960s, "and the biggest problem any family faced was 'Mother dented the car, and how do you keep Dad from finding out'; 'the boss is coming to dinner, and the roast's ruined.' The message that was sending out was that we didn't have any problems."

Mr. Lear's shows sent different messages, far more in tune with what was actually happening in those turbulent times. His crowning achievement was "All in the Family," and his greatest creation was Archie Bunker, the focus of that show and one of the most enduring characters in television history.
An unapologetic bigot who was seemingly always angry at one minority group or another (and usually at least one family member as well), Archie, memorably portrayed by Carroll O'Connor, was also, with his malaprops, his mangled syntax and his misguided enthusiasm, strangely likable.
A Sitcom Shockwave
"All in the Family" sent a shock through the sleepy world of the sitcom with one tart, topical episode after another from the moment it premiered on CBS on Jan. 12, 1971.
Even now, more than 50 years later, there are critics who say that this date should live in infamy, that ABC was right when it turned down the show out of fear that it would offend too many people. Archie, in this view, was a fanatic who made narrow-mindedness seem appealing.
But Mr. Lear, who adapted "All in the Family" from a British sitcom and based Archie in part on his own father, saw it differently. "I've never known a bigot who didn't have something endearing," he once said.
Mr. Lear went on to create a television empire and to become politically active, notably with his founding of the liberal advocacy organization People for the American Way, the kind of organization that Archie Bunker would have enjoyed sneering at.
Archie had choice words for all races, creeds and sexual orientations (except his own), and he didn't spare his family. His sweet and dignified wife, Edith (Jean Stapleton), was a "dingbat"; his daughter, Gloria (Sally Struthers), was "a weepin' Nellie"; his liberal son-in-law, Michael Stivic (Rob Reiner), was a "meathead" and, on occasion, a "dumb Polack." Strictly a law-and-order guy, Archie also voiced strong reservations about what he saw as campus subversives, welfare chiselers and bleeding hearts.
Such pronouncements were scandalous in the prime-time television world of the day. But Mr. Lear had found a gold mine.
"All in the Family" ran until 1979 and dominated the ratings for most of that time. More important, it established a template for television comedy by mixing political and social messages, as well as moments of serious drama, with the laughter.
The Lear philosophy was further developed in two shows built around characters who originally appeared on "All in the Family": "Maude" and "The Jeffersons."
"Maude," which ran from 1972 to 1978 on CBS, centered on Edith Bunker's cousin Maude Findlay (Bea Arthur), who was as much a doctrinaire liberal as Archie was a determined denizen of the far, far right. The show dealt with alcoholism, pot smoking, abortion (Maude herself had one, in a two-part episode that generated outrage as well as applause) and other subjects to which that quick-tongued title character could apply her shrill wisdom.
George Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley), the central character of "The Jeffersons," was a Black man who ran a successful dry-cleaning business in Archie's neighborhood and whose disdain for white people rivaled Archie's for Black people. "The Jeffersons," the story of George's life with his newly moneyed family after they moved to the East Side of Manhattan, ran on CBS from 1975 to 1985.
Not all of Mr. Lear's shows grew out of Archie's universe. One that did not, "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," raised as many eyebrows as "All in the Family."
A five-episodes-a-week spoof of soap operas, "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" was the story of a television-obsessed housewife (Louise Lasser in the title role) in the fictional small town of Fernwood, Ohio, who had more than her share of calamity: Her grandfather was a flasher, her mother was a flake, her husband was cheating on her, their daughter was kidnapped, and Mary herself had a breakdown on live TV.
"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" was too hot for the networks. Mr. Lear syndicated it himself, and in most markets it was on after the late news.
He said he thought of the show as "affirmative" and its characters as "survivors." But for all the waves they made, they did not survive long.
The show made its debut in 1976, Ms. Lasser left the next year, and, after being replaced for the summer by the talk-show parody "Fernwood 2-Night" (which later morphed into "America 2-Night") and then returning without her as "Forever Fernwood," it was gone by early 1978.
Other Lear shows had longer lives. "Sanford and Son," starring the longtime Black comedian Redd Foxx as an irascible junk dealer -- and, like "All in the Family," based on a successful British sitcom -- ran on NBC from 1972 to 1977. "One Day at a Time" (CBS, 1975-84) concerned a divorced woman (Bonnie Franklin) living on her own with two teenage daughters. "Good Times" (CBS, 1974-79), a spinoff of "Maude," was the story of a hard-working Black woman (Esther Rolle) struggling to raise a family in a Chicago housing project -- at first with her husband (John Amos) and then, when Mr. Amos was let go, as a widow. (Ms. Rolle herself left the show after the fourth season, unhappy with the direction it had taken, but returned a year later.)
Son of a Salesman
Norman Milton Lear was born on July 27, 1922, in New Haven, Conn., to Herman and Jeanette (Seicol) Lear. His father was a salesman of various products who was not very good at selling much of anything, who sometimes ran afoul of the law, and who had, his son later recalled, more than a hint of Archie in him. He would tell his wife to "stifle" herself, just as Archie would with Edith, and more than once told Norman, "You are the laziest white kid I ever saw."
Raised mostly in Hartford, Norman graduated from Weaver High School there in 1940 and attended Emerson College in Boston, but left shortly after the United States entered World War II to enlist in the Army Air Forces. He rose to technical sergeant and flew 52 missions as a radioman, most from a base near Foggia, Italy. He received the Air Medal with four oak-leaf clusters.
After the war, millions of servicemen and women took advantage of the G.I. Bill of Rights to attend college, but Mr. Lear decided he would not return to Emerson. With the help of an uncle who was a press agent, he got a job with the publicity firm of George and Dorothy Ross, who had many clients in the theater. He lasted a year before being fired for planting one too many items that were demonstrably false.
He found a way to put his imagination to better use after he and his first wife, Charlotte, moved to Los Angeles in 1949. For a while he and a friend, Ed Simmons, worked as door-to-door salesmen. Eventually they started to write comedy routines together.
Their break came when Mr. Lear called the agent for the popular nightclub entertainer Danny Thomas, who would later become a TV star, and got his home phone number by pretending to be a New York Times reporter. Mr. Thomas appreciated the boldness of the ploy. He also liked the routine the two men wrote for him, and purchased it.
Television in its infancy needed material of all kinds, and Mr. Lear and Mr. Simmons soon became writers for Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, who were among the rotating hosts of "The Colgate Comedy Hour." They went on to write for "The Martha Raye Show" (which Mr. Lear directed as well), after which they went their separate ways. Mr. Lear wrote and produced "The George Gobel Show."
In 1958, Mr. Lear and his fellow writer Bud Yorkin formed Tandem Productions -- so named, they said, because they thought of themselves as not unlike two men going uphill on a tandem bicycle. The company produced the singer Andy Williams's long-running variety show, as well as many television specials and several movies.
Mr. Lear wrote the screenplay for the Tandem film "Come Blow Your Horn" (1963), starring Frank Sinatra, directed by Mr. Yorkin and based on a Neil Simon play. His script for "Divorce, American Style" (1967), starring Dick Van Dyke and Debbie Reynolds and also directed by Mr. Yorkin, was nominated for an Academy Award.
Mr. Lear was one of the writers of "The Night They Raided Minsky's" (1968), a celebration of the glory days of burlesque directed by William Friedkin. And he wrote and directed "Cold Turkey" (1971), also starring Mr. Van Dyke, about a town that quits cigarettes en masse to win a $ 25 million prize. He might have remained a reasonably successful but relatively obscure screenwriter and occasional director had he and Mr., Yorkin not learned about a BBC series called "Till Death Us Do Part."
That show, about an outspoken bigot and his family, was a hit in England. They thought they could adapt it for an American audience.
Mr. Lear wrote a script modeled on "Till Death Us Do Part," and he and Mr. Yorkin shot two pilot episodes for ABC. The network, however, rejected the show, originally titled "Justice for All" (the lead character was originally named Archie Justice), and CBS almost did, too, but Robert D. Wood, the president of CBS Television at the time, had faith in the idea. He fought for it and put the show, by then named "All in the Family," on the air.
A Hot-Button Hit
Some critics embraced the show; many did not. John Leonard, writing in Life magazine under his pen name Cyclops, called it "wretched." Fred Ferretti of The New York Times wrote that its ethnic slurs "shock because one is not used to hearing them shouted from the television tube during prime-time family programs." They "don't make one laugh," he added, "so much as they force self-conscious, semi-amused gasps."
But the public liked it. After being moved from Tuesday to Saturday, it became the top-rated show on television, and while moving in and out of different spots on the schedule, it remained at the top for five consecutive seasons. In March 1972, The Times reported that at 8 p.m. every Saturday, 60 percent of all television sets in America were turned to it, and from 50 million to 60 million viewers were watching -- among them Sammy Davis Jr., who rearranged his performing schedule so that he could watch in his dressing room. Mr. Davis made a memorable guest appearance, as himself, on an episode of the show that year, in which he famously took Archie by surprise by kissing him on the cheek.
Mr. Davis expressed amazement that anyone would be insulted by "All in the Family," but over the years many groups said they were -- and not just ethnic groups. Some older Americans, for instance, took offense to an episode in which two people were married in a nursing home and the bride fell asleep. Mr. Lear agreed not to permit its rebroadcast. It was one of the few occasions when he seemed to find merit in the complaints of his critics.
The debates never really stopped, but the show continued to garner high ratings into the late 1970s. Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers left after the 1977-78 season, and "All in the Family" went off the air in 1979. Mr. O'Connor continued to play Archie on "Archie Bunker's Place," which made its debut that fall in the same time slot, focusing on Archie as the proprietor of a neighborhood bar.
Jean Stapleton appeared on a few episodes of the new show before deciding, as she put it, that if she continued to play Edith Bunker "people will never think of me as anyone else." When the second season began, viewers learned that Edith had died. "Archie Bunker's Place" remained on the air until 1983.
"All in the Family" and its various cast members, writers and directors won 22 Emmy Awards, including three for Mr. Lear. In 1972, when the show won seven, Johnny Carson, that year's host, called the Emmy telecast "the Norman Lear show." Mr. Lear's shows were so successful for so long that Bob Hope once remarked, "We can all be proud of TV and its owner, Norman Lear."
But Mr. Lear also had his share of flops. In 1975, his "Hot L Baltimore," a sitcom set in a run-down hotel and based on a play by Lanford Wilson, lasted 13 weeks on ABC. And after a few more short-lived shows, his hot streak was over by the mid-1980s. Some later projects -- among them "704 Hauser" (1994), about a Black family living in Archie Bunker's former home -- were on the air for only a few weeks; others never got off the ground.
Working Till the End
Mr. Lear nevertheless kept his hand in television. In 2003, he helped write a few episodes of "South Park," the taboo-breaking animated series that was the "All in the Family" of its day. (The show's creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, have said that their bile-spewing character Eric Cartman is partly based on Archie Bunker.)
In 2009, Mr. Lear developed a series about professional wrestling for HBO, although it was not picked up. For several years he found no takers for his proposed series about retirees in Southern California, "Guess Who Died?"; that changed in 2017, when NBC committed to produce a pilot, but a year later the network declined to pick up the show.
Still working into his 90s, Mr. Lear was the executive producer of a new version of "One Day at a Time," centered on a Latino family, for Netflix. That series made its debut in 2017, to enthusiastic reviews, and lasted three seasons.
In July 2021, on his 99th birthday, TBS announced that it would develop a reboot of "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," starring Emily Hampshire, with Mr. Lear as an executive producer. The show has not yet begun production, but at his death Mr. Lear had other projects in the works, including an animated version of "Good Times"; a reboot of "Who's the Boss?"; and a sitcom, starring Laverne Cox and the comedian George Wallace, about a man who learns that his adult son has transitioned.
In May 2019, Mr. Lear and Jimmy Kimmel hosted a TV special on which episodes of "All in the Family" and "The Jeffersons" were recreated live by an all-star cast, including Woody Harrelson as Archie Bunker and Jamie Foxx as George Jefferson. The special was produced by Mr. Lear, Mr. Kimmel and others as part of a deal Mr. Lear had signed with Sony that included an option to reimagine his past shows and potentially produce reboots. A second special, recreating episodes of "All in the Family" and "Good Times," aired that December; a third, recreating episodes of two other series Mr. Lear's company had produced, "The Facts of Life" and "Diff'rent Strokes," was broadcast in 2021.
"Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's 'All in the Family' and 'The Jeffersons"' won an Emmy Award, making Mr. Lear, at 97, the oldest Emmy winner in history. It was his fifth Emmy but his first in 46 years. (The others had all been for "All in the Family.") He broke his own record by winning another Emmy the next year for "Live in Front of a Studio Audience: 'All in the Family' and 'Good Times."'
Honors and Activism
His other honors included lifetime achievement awards from the Producers Guild of America, the Television Critics Association and PEN Center USA. He was among the first inductees in the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1984, and he won Peabody Awards in 1977 (for "All in the Family") and 2016 (for his life's work). In 1999, President Bill Clinton awarded him a National Medal of Arts.
Mr. Lear was named a recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor in 2017. He attended the ceremony in Washington but skipped the reception at the White House, citing his unhappiness with the policies of the Trump administration.
"This is a presidency that has chosen to neglect totally the arts and humanities -- deliberately defund them -- and that doesn't rest pleasantly with me," he said in an interview with The Times.
Mr. Lear turned his attention back to movies in 1982, when he, Mr. Yorkin and Jerry Perenchio bought Avco Embassy Pictures. The newly renamed Embassy Communications released films, including Ingmar Bergman's "Fanny and Alexander" (1982) and the acclaimed mock documentary "This Is Spinal Tap" (1984), directed by the "All in the Family" alumnus Rob Reiner.
In 1985, after Mr. Lear acquired Mr. Yorkin's share, he and Mr. Perenchio sold Embassy and Tandem to the Coca-Cola Company for $ 485 million. That same year, Mr. Lear founded Act III Communications, named to signify the third act of his life. Act III's most notable productions were two other Rob Reiner films, "Stand by Me" (1986) and "The Princess Bride" (1987).
Mr. Lear entered the music business in 1999, when he and a partner acquired the Concord Music Group. (The company merged with Village Roadshow Entertainment Group in 2008 and was sold to Wood Creek Capital Management in 2013.)
Mr. Lear never made a secret of his liberal leanings, but he became increasingly active politically with the founding of People for the American Way in 1980 as a response to the Moral Majority and other voices on the right. The organization's efforts have included opposing a constitutional amendment barring desecration of the American flag, joining lawsuits on behalf of abortion rights and publishing the book "Hostile Climate: Report on Anti-Gay Activity."
In 1985, after almost 30 years of marriage, Mr. Lear and his second wife, Frances, reached a divorce settlement estimated at $ 100 million or more, money she used to found Lear's magazine. (The magazine went out of business after six years.) He later married Lyn Davis, a psychologist, who survives him.
He is also survived by their son, Benjamin; their daughters, Brianna and Madeline Lear; a daughter from his first marriage, Ellen Lear; two daughters from his second marriage, Kate and Maggie Lear; and four grandchildren.
Frances Lear died in 1996.
Mr. Lear's resources remained formidable even after his divorce, and he continued to give both money and time to numerous causes.
In 1989, he founded the Business Enterprise Trust to promote socially responsible business behavior and was among the founders of the Environmental Media Association, which encourages entertainment industry efforts to educate people about environmental issues. In 2003, he founded Declare Yourself, a nonprofit organization to motivate people between the ages of 18 and 29 to register to vote.
His $ 5 million pledge to the University of Southern California in the 1999-2000 academic year helped establish the Norman Lear Center at the university's Annenberg School for Communication, which offers a multidisciplinary program for the study of entertainment as a central component of 21st-century life.
In 2014, he published his autobiography, "Even This I Get to Experience." In the process of writing it, he told The New York Times, "I began to realize how hard it had been to be a human being."
He was also the subject of a documentary, "Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You," released in 2016.
On July 27, 2022, the day he turned 100, The Times published a guest essay by Mr. Lear in which he reflected on the state of the nation and observed, "To be honest, I'm a bit worried that I may be in better shape than our democracy is."
For all his political activism, Mr. Lear knew that he would be best remembered for his work in television. Interviewed by The Los Angeles Times in 2009, he offered a measured assessment of the impact shows like "All in the Family" had on society.
"I can't honestly say I can see anywhere where we changed anything," he said. "But what I have are thousands of memories of people relating to me that we made them talk. And you know, the funny thing is, people are still talking."

Summertime in the Country, and the Living Is Queasy: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: From upstairs to downstairs and the challenging moments in between, a walk through a particular subgenre of films ripe for dramatic tension.
If "Promising Young Woman" was Emerald Fennell's darkly comic take on the rape-revenge thriller -- one that rode a zeitgeisty wave of discourse onto a best original screenplay Oscar in 2021 -- "Saltburn" is the writer-director's entry in the country house canon. The film (in theaters) is the latest in a subgenre ripe for dramatic tension: upstairs versus downstairs; invited versus interloped; public versus private. Away from prying eyes, characters in these tales tend to revel in their idyllic surroundings as unseen, often sinister, forces work against them, resulting in an unforgettable stay.
In "Saltburn," Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan), a shy Oxford student, accepts an invitation to spend the summer at the family estate of a wealthy classmate, Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). While there, Oliver's adoration for the charming aristocrat reveals itself to be much more than an innocent infatuation.
With its covetous double helix of class consciousness and homoeroticism, "Saltburn" fits in nicely alongside literary classics like "Brideshead Revisited" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (and their many screen adaptations). Here are five other films where summering at a country house leads to significant power imbalances and lifelong consequences.
'The Go-Between' (1971)
Stream it on the Roku Channel.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Joseph Losey, whose 1963 film, "The Servant," is its own masterpiece of queer-coded dominance, works once again from a Harold Pinter screenplay to direct this quintessentially British period drama. Young Leo (Dominic Guard) is invited by a wealthy friend to spend the summer at his family's country house. But when his friend is quarantined with the measles, Leo must devise another way to pass the time. He soon finds himself the fraught messenger for his friend's beautiful sister (Julie Christie) and her secret lover, the tenant farmer (Alan Bates). Stunning shots of the property's fertile grounds fuel this Palme d'Or winner with a sense of freedom that its owners are quick to curtail; when the film catches up with Leo decades later, his loss of innocence can be pinpointed back to that fateful summer.
'Cries and Whispers' (1972)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The silence of God, humanity's inability to connect, the secret grudges that quietly tear families apart: all themes the Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman saw fit to set against the peacefulness of a summer house no less than a half dozen times. Here, it's a searing look at the final days of a woman dying of cancer at her family's opulent mansion, and her two sisters' painful attempt to thaw out years of estrangement. As they struggle against the clock to process their emotions, the house's maid shuffles in saintly servitude. Sven Nykvist's Oscar-winning cinematography places the white-clad women -- including the Bergman regulars Liv Ullmann, Harriet Andersson and Ingrid Thulin -- against richly saturated crimson walls, bringing out piercing performances from their icy exteriors.
'Grey Gardens' (1975)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
One of the most consequential documentaries of all time serves as a cautionary tale about what happens when you don't pack it up at summer's end. When Albert and David Maysles were hired by Jacqueline Kennedy's sister Lee Radziwill to make a film about their family, the documentarians' attention quickly shifted to the women's eccentric cousins: "Little Edie" and her mother, "Big Edie" Beale. The erstwhile socialites had boarded themselves up for nearly 20 years in their decaying home in East Hampton, N.Y., the stench of garbage and cat urine undergirding their peculiar relationship. With a distinctly American blend of can-do and laissez-faire, the Beales continue their business as usual, impervious to the changing tides of the outside world.
'Chinese Roulette' (1976)
Stream it on the Criterion Channel.
Born in Germany in 1945, Rainer Werner Fassbinder made films that emerged from a deep-seated mistrust of humanity. But he gave a despairing, devilish wink in even his cruelest works, like this bleak psychological thriller where two cheating spouses accidentally take lovers to their country estate on the same weekend. When their resentful young daughter arrives, she manipulates the foursome, the housekeeper and her son into playing the titular game, a sort of diabolical truth or dare, over dinner. Michael Ballhaus's cinematography constructs a claustrophobic ballet around the house's mirrored interiors, tightening reflective nooses around each of its deeply guilty guests.
'Call Me by Your Name' (2017)
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
James Ivory picked up the country house torch and ran through the '80s and '90s with hits like "A Room With a View" and "The Remains of the Day," all of which were produced by his partner, Ismail Merchant. But it was for adapting André Aciman's novel "Call Me by Your Name" that he won his first Oscar -- becoming the oldest-ever winner at 89. The director Luca Guadagnino bathes the film in its Northern Italian setting, where a bookworm teen learns of the wounding and healing powers of sexual attraction after a graduate student arrives at his family's lush villa.

As Brands Flee, X Sues Media Matters Over Research on Ads and Antisemitic Posts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: X asked a federal court to order the advocacy group to take down its findings, accusing it of "manipulating the algorithms."
X, the social media service formerly known as Twitter, sued Media Matters in federal court on Monday after the advocacy organization published research showing that ads on X appeared next to antisemitic content.
A post last week from Elon Musk that endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which he wrote a day before the Media Matters research was published, kicked off an advertiser exodus, with major brands like IBM, Apple, Warner Bros. Discovery and Sony pausing their spending on the platform.
X has rejected Media Matters' findings, saying they were not representative of a regular user's experience on the platform. On Friday, Mr. Musk promised a "thermonuclear lawsuit" against Media Matters and its backers.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, claims that Media Matters tried to damage X's relationships with advertisers. "Media Matters has manipulated the algorithms governing the user experience on X to bypass safeguards and create images of X's largest advertisers' paid posts adjacent to racist, incendiary content, leaving the false impression that these pairings are anything but what they actually are: manufactured, inorganic and extraordinarily rare," lawyers for X wrote in the complaint.
Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters, said in a statement, "This is a frivolous lawsuit meant to bully X's critics into silence." He added that his organization "stands behind its reporting and looks forward to winning in court." On Monday night, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also announced that his office would open an investigation into Media Matters for "potential fraudulent activity."
Brands have been hesitant to advertise on X since Mr. Musk bought the company a year ago and said he would relax its content-moderation policies. X has sought to woo hesitant advertisers back to the platform, an initiative that has been overseen by Linda Yaccarino, a longtime advertising executive who became X's chief executive in June.
But Mr. Musk's post on Wednesday, in which he agreed with a post from an X account accusing Jewish communities of pushing "hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them," was a setback.
"You have said the actual truth," Mr. Musk replied to the post.
Jewish groups quickly condemned the statement that Mr. Musk endorsed, likening it to the "Great Replacement Theory," a conspiracy theory that claims minorities are replacing white European populations as part of a coordinated effort by Jewish people. The White House condemned Mr. Musk's remark, and top-tier brands quickly pulled their advertising off X.
Mr. Musk said in a post to X on Sunday that claims that he was antisemitic were untrue. "Nothing could be further from the truth," he wrote.
In its lawsuit, X asked the court to order Media Matters to take down its published research. The lawsuit also seeks unspecified monetary damages and lawyers' fees.
Ms. Yaccarino said in a statement that the X account that Media Matters had used in its research was the only account that saw some of the ads next to the antisemitic posts in question. In the case of Apple, its ad was placed next to an antisemitic post and viewed by another user, she added.
"If you know me, you know I'm committed to truth and fairness," Ms. Yaccarino said in a post on X. "Data wins over manipulation or allegations. Don't be manipulated. Stand with X."
During an all-staff meeting on Monday, Ms. Yaccarino said she had discussed the issue with advertisers and was committed to defending X, according to audio of the meeting heard by The New York Times. In those conversations, some advertisers had asked her to be more communicative about problems to get in front of them, and to share more data about how ads are displayed on the platform, she said.
"We want to work with all of our partners who stand with us and believe in the power and the necessity of free speech," Ms. Yaccarino said. "Sometimes in life and in business, standing for your values is the truly defining thing that makes leaders, and we're going to hold on to that and keep pushing forward. No critic is ever going to deter us from our mission to keep fighting and protecting free speech."
In the roughly 30-minute meeting, Ms. Yaccarino focused the blame on Media Matters and did not address Mr. Musk's endorsement of the antisemitic post.
She also encouraged employees to be frugal during a period of decreased revenue caused by the advertiser pauses and think of ways the company could bring in more money.
"I would say be as fiscally responsible as possible," the chief executive told her workers. "And that's on a spectrum of critical-only and necessary travel to being a good steward of anything that might be related to an expenditure at the company."

Epic Games C.E.O. Testifies Google Asserts 'De Facto Control' on Android App: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Tim Sweeney, who runs the company that created Fortnite, testified in a case that, if he wins, could allow competing payment systems on the Play Store.
It was a long-awaited day in court for Epic Games' chief executive, Tim Sweeney, who testified in a San Francisco federal courthouse on Monday in the company's legal battle against Google.
The fight between the companies started in summer 2020 when Epic, the company behind the popular video game Fortnite, wanted Google to stop charging app developers a 30 percent fee for purchases made on its Play Store on Android devices.
When Google refused, Epic installed its own payment system in the Fortnite app on Android, charging consumers a lower price.
Google responded by removing Fortnite from its Play Store on Aug. 13, 2020. On the same day, Mr. Sweeney sued Google, accusing the tech giant of asserting monopolistic control over mobile game developers on its Play Store.
"I want to make it clear to everybody exactly what was happening on these platforms," Mr. Sweeney said from a witness stand on Monday. "I want everybody to see and understand Google exercises de facto control over the availability of apps on Android."
In 2021, a federal judge rejected most of Epic's arguments in a similar case against Apple. This time, a nine-person jury will decide whether Google violated antitrust laws by exploiting smaller rivals in a trial that is expected to conclude next month.
The outcome could have wide implications. If Epic wins, Google could be forced to allow other companies to offer competing payment systems on the Play Store.
Since the trial started two weeks ago, Mr. Sweeney has been sitting in the front row of the courtroom almost every day. He was determined to go to trial alone: Google announced a settlement last month with the other plaintiff in this case, Match Group, a dating app company. In September, Google reached a settlement with dozens of state attorneys general who sued the company on similar grounds.
In his testimony, Mr. Sweeney insisted that his goal was to distribute the games to more users, rather than seek monetary damages, and that Google's fee prevented Epic from expanding its business. In a cross-examination, Google's lawyer, Jonathan Kravis, said Epic also paid gaming console companies, including Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft, a 30 percent commission fee and had made $ 12 billion from the consoles together.
Mr. Sweeney nodded to the number, despite saying earlier on Monday that Epic is currently losing money.
Mr. Kravis also pushed Mr. Sweeney on his claim about passing the savings from the fees to customers. For example, Epic is charging the same price for in-game purchases on all platforms, including its own store, where it doesn't pay a fee.
"You are putting the money in your pocket, right?" Mr. Kravis asked.
Mr. Sweeney did not deny the allegation, but he said Epic was saving about 3 percent from not using a payment processor. In testimony later, he also said that a contract with Sony prevented Epic from selling Fortnite's in-game product for less than its price on PlayStation, and that Apple and Microsoft were paid nothing when Epic distributed such products through the companies' personal computers.

More Companies Stop Ad Buys on X as Musk Fallout Grows: [National Desk]

Full text: Warner Bros. and Sony have joined other companies in pausing spending on X, formerly Twitter, over Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic post.
More major advertisers have paused their spending on X, the social media service formerly known as Twitter, as the backlash continued over Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X.
The entertainment company Warner Bros. and Sony have joined other prominent brands in halting their spending on X. IBM cut off its advertising on X on Thursday, while Apple, Lionsgate, the entertainment and film distribution company, and Paramount Global, the media giant that owns CBS, all paused their ads on Friday.
The spending freeze comes as X has fought to win back advertisers who were wary of spending on the platform after Mr. Musk took it over a year ago and said he would loosen content moderation rules. Major brands tend to be cautious about placing their ads next to posts with offensive or hateful speech.
Mr. Musk, who bought Twitter in October 2022 and renamed it X, drew scrutiny this week after replying to a post on X that accused Jewish people who are facing antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war of pushing the "exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them" and supporting the immigration of "hordes of minorities."
"You have said the actual truth," Mr. Musk replied. Jewish groups said that Mr. Musk's message boosted a conspiracy theory known as replacement theory, which claims that Jews have organized nonwhite immigrants to replace the white race. The concept was embraced by Robert Bowers, who killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.
Mr. Musk's statement drew condemnation from the White House on Friday. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that it was "unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust."
Mr. Musk lashed out at advertisers who had pulled their dollars from X on Friday, and threatened legal action against Media Matters, a left-wing advocacy organization that said it found antisemitic content on X and highlighted advertisements for Apple, IBM and other brands that appeared alongside posts touting Hitler and the Nazi Party.
In a post on Friday night, Mr. Musk said, "The split second court opens on Monday, X Corp will be filing a thermonuclear lawsuit against Media Matters and ALL those who colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company."
X said that the research strategy used by Media Matters to discover the advertisements that ran along antisemitic content was not representative of how regular people use its platform. The organization followed accounts that posted the content, then refreshed the X timeline until ads appeared, X said in a blog post. Only one of the nine posts highlighted by Media Matters violated its content moderation rules, X added.
In a statement, Joe Benarroch, the head of business operations at X, said, "50 impressions served against the content in the article, out of 5.5 billion served the whole day, points to the fact of how efficiently our model avoids content for advertisers." He added, "Data wins over allegations."
Media Matters said that it would defend itself from litigation by X. "Far from the free speech advocate he claims to be, Musk is a bully threatening a meritless lawsuit in an attempt to silence reporting that he even confirmed is accurate," said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters. "Musk admitted the ads at issue ran alongside the pro-Nazi content we identified. This is like getting mad at a mirror because you don't like the reflection. If he does sue us, we will win."

Full text: Maybe it's her grandkids, maybe it's being 81, but Barbra Streisand is open to new stuff. Take sharing. Well, take sharing herself. "My Name Is Barbra," her first memoir, is upon us. It's 970 pages and billows with doubt, anger, ardor, hurt, pride, persuasion, glory and Yiddish. I don't know that any artist has done more sharing.
And yet, last month, after lunch at her home in Malibu, Calif., Streisand shared something else, a treasure she guards almost as much she's guarded the details of her life. And that's dessert. There's a lot in this book -- tales of film and television shoots, clashes and bonds with collaborators, a whole chapter on Don Johnson (it's short) and another called "Politics," her unwavering preference for big blends of the masculine and the feminine. But food is so ubiquitous that it's practically a love of Streisand's life, especially ice cream.
So when it's time for dessert at Streisand's, despite any choice you're offered, there's truly only one option. And that's McConnell's Brazilian Coffee ice cream. She writes about it with an orgasmic zeal comparable only, perhaps, to her stated zests for Modigliani and Sondheim. How much does Streisand love Brazilian Coffee? In the book, she's in the middle of a sad story about a dinner with her buddy Marlon Brando at Quincy Jones's place, when she interrupts herself to rhapsodize over its flavor and reminisce on the lengths she has gone to get some. So I wanted to have what she's having.
"Okaaayyyy," Streisand said. She gave her longtime assistant, Renata Buser, a deep, knowing look.
"We'll trade. You give a good review."
Panic, panic, panic. Stammer, stammer, stammer.
She was grinning. Buser was smiling.
"I love to laugh right now," said Streisand, who said she's been in a funk over the state of the planet.
Buser agreed: "You really needed a laugh."
But Streisand wasn't entirely kidding -- well, about the good review she was. But not about the ice cream.
See, sometimes, they explained, like two girls talking about an ornate but dire piece of cafeteria gossip, there's a situation with how available it is. (Basically, McConnell's sometimes takes Brazilian Coffee off the market, leaving Turkish Coffee and sometimes just ... "Coffee.") When she gets her hands on some, she all but password-protects it. "My husband happens to like Turkish Coffee. Thank God," Streisand says of the actor James Brolin, her spouse of 25 years. "So he doesn't take my stash."
To be clear: They're not the same?
"Noooo," Streisand and Buser said together. Streisand was shrugging that "are you serious right now?" shrug: "Turkey is not Brazil."
It goes on like this for another minute until something crucial suddenly occurs to Streisand.
"Are you a fan of coffee ice cream?"
Crickets ...
She didn't have time for this. "We have vanilla." More kidding. "I'll give you a scoop -- well, how about half a scoop? He'll have half a scoop. I'll take the other half."
Eventually, Buser arrives with a bowl, and I get it.
If Loro Piana made dessert, this is how it would taste, like money. Buser had lodged Streisand's demiscoop inside a wafer cone just the way she likes. Mine was gone in about 90 seconds. Streisand, though -- she made the eating of this ounce of ice cream a discreet aria of bliss. Little nibbles of cone, then one spin around her mouth. Nibble, nibble, spin. I've seen one other person make love to a dessert this way, and she gave birth to me. Otherwise, no one will ever quite have what they're having.
THIS MEMOIR OF STREISAND'S encompasses her girlhood in working-class Brooklyn in the 1940s, her big break on Broadway in "Funny Girl" in 1964, a movie career that made her the biggest actress of the 1970s, her popular albums and top-rated TV specials, the awards, the snubs, her hangups, terrors and passions, her close girlfriends, the men she's loved and, yes, the foods she might adore more. "My Name Is Barbra" is explanatory and ruminative and enlightening. It's shake-your-head funny and hand-to-mouth surprising. The lady who wrote it is in touch with herself, loves being herself. Yet she disliked memoir-writing's ostensible point. "I've been through therapy many, many years ago, trying to figure these things out," she told me. "And I got bored with that. Trying to get things out. I really didn't want to relive my life."
Writing the book forced Streisand not only to relive it, but to do the synthesizing between the present and the past. For instance, she frequently reckons with how losing her father at a young age and living for decades with her mother's glass-half-empty approach to maternity set her up for a journey of approval.
Those 970 pages also turn the book into a piece of exercise equipment. Streisand doesn't like the heft. "I wanted two volumes," she said. "Who wants to hold a heavy book like that in their hands?"
Rick Kot, an executive editor at Viking who oversaw production on the book, told me, "Publishing books in two volumes is difficult just as a commercial venture. And nobody seems to have any issue with how long" Streisand's is.
The bigness of it makes literal the career it contains. Streisand is poring over, pouring out, her life. She's feeling her way through it, remembering, sometimes Googling as she types. It's not a book you inhale, per se. (Unless, of course, you've got a pressing lunch date with the author.) Nor does it inspire the "five takeaways" treatment that juicy new memoirs by Britney Spears and Jada Pinkett Smith have. Not that there weren't requests for spicier material. Streisand said that Christine Pittel, her editor, told her "that I had to leave some blood on the page." So feelings are more deeply plumbed; names are named.
And she did do some hemming and hawing. "I was very late in delivering the book," she said. "I think I was supposed to deliver it in two years." It took her 10. And as she went, she thought about her legacy. "If you want to read about me in 20 years or 50 years, whatever it is -- if there's still a world -- these are my words. These are my thoughts." She also considered those other Streisand titles, the ones by other people. "Hopefully, you don't have to look at too many books written about me. You know, whenever I was told about what they said, certain things, I thought, like, who are they talking about?"
There are takeaways. But they're too chronic to qualify as "current." Mostly, they involve Streisand's hunger for work and her endless quest to maintain control over it. Singing and acting made her famous. This insistence on perfection made her notorious. Sexism and chauvinism are on display throughout the book. But what becomes apparent is that the woman who has a "directed by" credit on just three films ("Yentl," "The Prince of Tides" and "The Mirror Has Two Faces") had been a director from the very start of her career. Here is the book's grand revelation -- for a reader but for the author, too. "I didn't know about it," she said, of this proclivity for management, planning, vision, authority and obeying her instincts. "But writing the book, I discovered it. Basically, I was doing that, you know, when I was 19 years old -- or even showing my mother how to smoke."
Streisand is unsparing about the treachery she faced at work, collaborating with men. Sydney Chaplin (one of Charlie's kids) played the original Nick Arnstein during her "Funny Girl" Broadway run; they shared a flirtation that Chaplin wanted to consummate and that Streisand wanted to keep professional. (For one thing, she was married to Elliott Gould.) So, she writes, Chaplin did a number on her. In front of live audiences, he'd lean in to whisper put-downs and profanity. When it came time to shoot "Hello, Dolly!," Streisand couldn't understand why her co-star Walter Matthau and their director, Gene Kelly (yes, the Gene Kelly) were so hostile toward her. She confronts Matthau, and he confesses: "You hurt my friend," meaning Chaplin, his poker buddy. Throughout her career, she's up against what one surly camera operator, on the set of "The Prince of Tides," boasts is a boys' club.
That's the sort of blood that gives this book its power -- not the prospect of a bluntly louche Brando and a doting Pierre Trudeau being honest-to-God soul mates, not whatever her byzantine thing with Jon Peters was about. It's that Barbra Streisand endured a parade of harsh workplaces yet never stopped trying to make the best work. That experience with Chaplin left her with lifelong stage fright. But what if it also helped sharpen her volition to get things -- in the studio, on a film set, before a show -- exactly, possibly obsessively, right?
"When I was younger, I think they had a preconception, you know, because maybe I was aloof or something, because I was a singer but I wanted to be an actress. And then as an actress, I wanted to be a director," she said to me. "In other words, take another step. Be the actress as well as the singer. To me, it was so much easier to look at the whole. But even when I was an actress, I would care about the whole." Like that scene in Sydney Pollack's "The Way We Were," from 1973, where Streisand touches Robert Redford's hair while he's sleeping, a personal choice she made by instinct.
Over and over again -- with TV specials, live concerts, musical arrangements -- she was executing ideas. The execution earned her a permanent reputation. And she knows it. In the book, she tells a story about making some staging suggestions for her 1980 Grammys performance with Neil Diamond and muses, "This kind of incident may be why I'm called 'difficult."'
"Difficult" is in the work. Streisand's characters constitute this cocktail of "mercurial" and "determined" with a couple squirts of "feral." They're multitaskers, consumed with both busyness and learning how to do something. She was perfect for romantic comedies during second-wave feminism: Her drive drove men nuts. My favorite performance from this '70s run of hers is in "The Main Event," a frothy, filthy, solidly funny screwball hit from 1979. She's in high expressive form and at peak curls, playing Hillary Kramer, a fragrance mogul forced to sell her company after her accountant runs off with all her money. But she discovers a surprise asset: a terrible boxer, Eddie "Kid Natural" Scanlon (Ryan O'Neal), whose career she tries to turn around. The movie, which Howard Zieff directed, sums up the Streisand experience: her tenacity; her outrageous comfort as both a comedic actor and as a version of herself; her exasperation with men who exploit her and count her out.
Eddie doesn't want to work with Hillary and bets that the sight of his battered face will disgust her right out of boxing management. The violence of boxing does send Hillary vomiting during the drive home from one of his fights. What it doesn't do is deter her. "I hope this taught you a lesson," says Whitman Mayo, who plays Eddie's pal and trainer, Percy. "It has," Streisand says. "Get him in shape."
The two men share a sinking feeling, seemingly typical when it comes to Streisand. "She's not giving up, Percy," Eddie says to his trainer, who must concur: "That's a problem." People who've negotiated with her probably recognize the look of worry and fatigued resignation on O'Neal's face. He's going to lose.
It's reasonable to suspect that Tom Rothman, the head of Sony Pictures, knows the feeling. When the company was planning to release an anniversary edition of "The Way We Were" this year, Streisand argued for him to include two scenes that, she was pained to discover, had been omitted from the original. For Rothman, the trouble with granting Streisand her wish was that, as "a filmmaker's executive," as he put it in an interview, he didn't want to change anything without Pollack's input. But Pollack's been dead for 15 years. They agreed to release two versions: Pollack's and, essentially, Streisand's extended cut.
This, she writes, is a triumph of her relentlessness. "The word she uses in the book, that's 100 percent accurate," Rothman told me. "She's relentless." Her being right about the scenes didn't matter to his bottom line, which required him to do justice to Pollack's memory while assuaging Streisand's worries over creative injustice. "She would say: 'This is better, this is better! This is why it's good!' And I would say: 'But Sydney Pollack didn't want it!"'
The reason Rothman wanted to land at a happy solution was because of the person he was negotiating with. "Barbra broke a lot of not just artistic boundaries but boundaries for female artists in the movie business, in Hollywood, in terms of taking control of her career," he said. "I have boundless respect for her."
Streisand's boundlessness, her capaciousness -- the lack of precedent for her whole-enchilada ambitions, the daffiness, the sexiness, the talent, orchestration, passion, originality; her persistence and indefatigability; the outfits; the hair -- were a watershed. She was always adapting, if not to what was cool or "current," per se, then certainly to whom she felt she was at a given moment. "You know me," she writes, late in the book. "I'm the version queen."
The line is straight from Streisand to Madonna, Janet Jackson, Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift -- version queens of different kingdoms. That's just a list of the obvious people who followed her into showbiz and makes no mention of the less famous folks whom Streisand inspired into a thousand other achievements. She's "to thine own self be true" in neon. This might be the real Streisand Effect. And now she can take a step back and appreciate it.
"That gives me real joy, that I affected some people into doing what they wanted to do," Streisand said. "That I gave them some sort of courage. Or if they felt different, you know, I was somebody who felt different. That's a reward for me. That makes me feel great."
THIS HOME OF STREISAND'S has been called a compound. But even with the ocean overlook, it's too rustic, cozy and deceptively modest for the geologic or ego-logical footprint that "compound" connotes. There's an active farm and enough rose varieties to hijack a flower show. It's neither Xanadu nor Neverland Ranch. There's some reality to Streisand's place, some soul.
This is to say that paintings are everywhere, outside the bathroom, up the main staircase, in the bathroom. There are oils by John Singer Sargent and Thomas Hart Benton, portraits by Ammi Phillips and Mary Cassatt. A wall holds one of Gilbert Stuart's George Washingtons. She loves Klimt and adores Tamara de Lempicka and Modigliani, adores them with an awe the world reserves for her. Some of the paintings are by Streisand, including a portrait of Sammie, her late Coton de Tulear, whose fur is affixed to the canvas. One, her son, Jason Gould, did.
Streisand's fans know what's on her property and the labor she personally devoted to realizing it -- that there's a mill with a functioning waterwheel, that she's dedicated a room to her collection of dolls and that another's maintained for the display and storage of her stage and screen costumes. They'd know because, in 2010, Streisand put it all in a book called "My Passion for Design." Nevertheless, people have concluded that Streisand lives at her own personal Grove. They'll ask: Are you going to see the mall? But there is no mall to see. Nothing's for sale, nothing is open to the public.
Less known is how it might feel to stand here, in a living room at Streisand's house, to gaze over her shoulder at the ocean and stop yourself from saying out loud, "On a clear day you really can see forever." It's strange to move from the bulk of her book to the lightness of the woman who wrote it, to the one-of-a-kind incandescence that's kept her a star. No memoir can quite contain that. An odd effect of that stardom is how that person can start to seem an uncanny sort of familiar. One of the mightiest, most Olympic performers we Americans have ever experienced, is, on a Tuesday at lunchtime -- and I mean this from the bottom of my heart -- just some lady. The one behind you at a Gelson's, maybe, who might notice the cottage cheese in your cart and get moony over how creamy it is. ("I love going to the supermarket," she told me.)
After lunch, Streisand was ready to relax and needed to stretch her back, which lately has been acting up. Relaxing meant letting loose her three Cotons de Tulear, dogs as white as snowflakes, whiter in fact, like bleached teeth. It meant retreating to the family room. So off I went down a wallpapered hallway paneled with more framed art and into another section of the house that felt different from the airs of presentation and preservation that typify the rest of the home. The kitchen was here, for one thing. For another, hunched over a round table was James Brolin. Streisand calls him Jim, and Jim was in a T-shirt and sweatpants, cross-referencing information on an iPad with what he was writing on a sheet of paper. He was jotting down film titles to watch later for movie night. They had just had a Scorsese marathon.
There's life all over the property. But here in the family room is where everybody lives, including that portrait of Sammie, which, at the moment, was propped up on the floor because "I don't have any places to hang anything anymore," she said. This way she can see it from the sofa while she watches TV. This part of the house seems like the only place where anything gets strewn. "It's not that orderly," she told me. "Meaning, I have the things I need around me." Like her pets, like Jim. "It's a playroom. We watch TV, we have the dogs on our laps. It's more disordered."
It felt, in many ways, like a secret, the comfy chaos of this zone feeling preferable to the control on display everywhere else. Streisand seemed at home here because she was. She took a seat and proceeded to ply the dogs, Fanny and Sammie's lab-bred clones, Scarlet and Violet, with a treat. They looked up at her with expectant patience. I've seen scores of dogs anticipate a treat. It's as if Streisand's had heard about the bonkers approach of those other dogs and zigged, sitting patiently as Streisand doled a morsel or two to each. Even she seemed impressed. Here is another of stardom's odd effects. Without us, it's Tuesday.

MALIBU, Calif. — Maybe it’s her grandkids, maybe it’s being 81, but Barbra Streisand is open to new stuff. Take sharing. Well, take sharing herself . “My Name Is Barbra,” her first memoir, is upon us. It’s 970 pages and billows with doubt, anger, ardor, hurt, pride, persuasion, glory and Yiddish. I don’t know that any artist has done more sharing.
And yet, last month, after lunch at her home in Malibu, California, Streisand shared something else, a treasure she guards almost as much she’s guarded the details of her life. And that’s dessert. There’s a lot in this book — tales of film and television shoots, clashes and bonds with collaborators, a whole chapter on Don Johnson (it’s short) and another called “Politics,” her unwavering preference for big blends of the masculine and the feminine. But food is so ubiquitous that it’s practically a love of Streisand’s life, especially ice cream.
So when it’s time for dessert at Streisand’s, despite any choice you’re offered, there’s truly only one option. And that’s McConnell’s Brazilian Coffee ice cream. She writes about it with an orgasmic zeal comparable only, perhaps, to her stated zests for Modigliani and Sondheim. How much does Streisand love Brazilian Coffee? In the book, she’s in the middle of a sad story about a dinner with her buddy Marlon Brando at Quincy Jones’ place, when she interrupts herself to rhapsodize over its flavor and reminisce on the lengths she has gone to get some. So I wanted to have what she’s having.
“ Okaaayyyy ,” Streisand said. She gave her longtime assistant, Renata Buser, a deep, knowing look.
“We’ll trade. You give a good review.”
Panic, panic, panic. Stammer, stammer, stammer.
She was grinning. Buser was smiling.
“I love to laugh right now,” said Streisand, who said she’s been in a funk over the state of the planet.
Buser agreed: “You really needed a laugh.”
But Streisand wasn’t entirely kidding — well, about the good review she was. But not about the ice cream.
See, sometimes, they explained, like two girls talking about an ornate but dire piece of cafeteria gossip, there’s a situation with how available it is. (Basically, McConnell’s sometimes takes Brazilian Coffee off the market, leaving Turkish Coffee and sometimes just … “Coffee.”) When she gets her hands on some, she all but password-protects it. “My husband happens to like Turkish Coffee. Thank God ,” Streisand says of actor James Brolin, her spouse of 25 years. “So he doesn’t take my stash.”
To be clear: They’re not the same?
“ Noooo, ” Streisand and Buser said together. Streisand was shrugging that “are you serious right now?” shrug: “Turkey is not Brazil .”
It goes on like this for another minute until something crucial suddenly occurs to Streisand.
“Are you a fan of coffee ice cream?”
Crickets …
She didn’t have time for this. “We have vanilla.” More kidding. “I’ll give you a scoop — well, how about half a scoop? He’ll have half a scoop. I’ll take the other half.”
Eventually, Buser arrives with a bowl, and I get it.
If Loro Piana made dessert, this is how it would taste, like money. Buser had lodged Streisand’s demiscoop inside a wafer cone just the way she likes. Mine was gone in about 90 seconds.

That’s just a list of the obvious people who followed her into showbiz and makes no mention of the less famous folks whom Streisand inspired into a thousand other achievements. She’s “to thine own self be true” in neon. This might be the real Streisand Effect. And now she can take a step back and appreciate it.
“That gives me real joy, that I affected some people into doing what they wanted to do,” Streisand said. “That I gave them some sort of courage. Or if they felt different, you know, I was somebody who felt different. That’s a reward for me. That makes me feel great.”
THIS HOME OF STREISAND’S has been called a compound. But even with the ocean overlook, it’s too rustic, cozy and deceptively modest for the geologic or ego-logical footprint that “compound” connotes. There’s an active farm and enough rose varieties to hijack a flower show. It’s neither Xanadu nor Neverland Ranch. There’s some reality to Streisand’s place, some soul.
This is to say that paintings are everywhere, outside the bathroom, up the main staircase, in the bathroom. There are oils by John Singer Sargent and Thomas Hart Benton, portraits by Ammi Phillips and Mary Cassatt. A wall holds one of Gilbert Stuart’s George Washingtons. She loves Klimt and adores Tamara de Lempicka and Modigliani, adores them with an awe the world reserves for her. Some of the paintings are by Streisand, including a portrait of Sammie, her late Coton de Tulear, whose fur is affixed to the canvas. One, her son, Jason Gould, did.
Streisand’s fans know what’s on her property and the labor she personally devoted to realizing it — that there’s a mill with a functioning waterwheel, that she’s dedicated a room to her collection of dolls and that another’s maintained for the display and storage of her stage and screen costumes. They’d know because, in 2010, Streisand put it all in a book called “My Passion for Design.” Nevertheless, people have concluded that Streisand lives at her own personal Grove. They’ll ask: Are you going to see the mall? But there is no mall to see. Nothing’s for sale, nothing is open to the public.
Less known is how it might feel to stand here, in a living room at Streisand’s house, to gaze over her shoulder at the ocean and stop yourself from saying out loud, “On a clear day you really can see forever.” It’s strange to move from the bulk of her book to the lightness of the woman who wrote it, to the one-of-a-kind incandescence that’s kept her a star. No memoir can quite contain that. An odd effect of that stardom is how that person can start to seem an uncanny sort of familiar. One of the mightiest, most Olympic performers we Americans have ever experienced, is, on a Tuesday at lunchtime — and I mean this from the bottom of my heart — just some lady. The one behind you at a Gelson’s, maybe, who might notice the cottage cheese in your cart and get moony over how creamy it is. (“I love going to the supermarket,” she told me.)
After lunch, Streisand was ready to relax and needed to stretch her back, which lately has been acting up. Relaxing meant letting loose her three Cotons de Tulear, dogs as white as snowflakes, whiter in fact, like bleached teeth. It meant retreating to the family room. So off I went down a wallpapered hallway paneled with more framed art and into another section of the house that felt different from the airs of presentation and preservation that typify the rest of the home. The kitchen was here, for one thing. For another, hunched over a round table was James Brolin. Streisand calls him Jim, and Jim was in a T-shirt and sweatpants, cross-referencing information on an iPad with what he was writing on a sheet of paper. He was jotting down film titles to watch later for movie night. They had just had a Scorsese marathon.
There’s life all over the property. But here in the family room is where everybody lives, including that portrait of Sammie, which, at the moment, was propped up on the floor because “I don’t have any places to hang anything anymore,” she said. This way she can see it from the sofa while she watches TV. This part of the house seems like the only place where anything gets strewn. “It’s not that orderly,” she told me. “Meaning, I have the things I need around me.” Like her pets, like Jim. “It’s a playroom. We watch TV, we have the dogs on our laps. It’s more disordered.”
It felt, in many ways, like a secret, the comfy chaos of this zone feeling preferable to the control on display everywhere else. Streisand seemed at home here because she was. She took a seat and proceeded to ply the dogs, Fanny and Sammie’s lab-bred clones, Scarlet and Violet, with a treat. They looked up at her with expectant patience. I’ve seen scores of dogs anticipate a treat. It’s as if Streisand’s had heard about the bonkers approach of those other dogs and zigged, sitting patiently as Streisand doled a morsel or two to each. Even she seemed impressed. Here is another of stardom’s odd effects. Without us, it’s Tuesday.

Full text: The agreement all but ends one of the longest labor crises in the history of the entertainment industry. Union members still have to approve the deal.
One of the longest labor crises in Hollywood history is finally coming to an end.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing tens of thousands of actors, reached a tentative deal for a new contract with entertainment companies on Wednesday, clearing the way for the $ 134 billion American movie and television business to swing back into motion.
Hollywood's assembly lines have been at a near-standstill since May because of a pair of strikes by writers and actors, resulting in financial pain for studios and for many of the two million Americans -- makeup artists, set builders, location scouts, chauffeurs, casting directors -- who work in jobs directly or indirectly related to making TV shows and films.
Upset about streaming-service pay and fearful of fast-developing artificial intelligence technology, actors joined screenwriters on picket lines in July. The writers had walked out in May over similar concerns. It was the first time since 1960, when Ronald Reagan was the head of the actors' union and Marilyn Monroe was still starring in films, that actors and writers were both on strike.
The Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,500 screenwriters, reached a tentative agreement with studios on Sept. 24 and ended its 148-day strike on Sept. 27. In the coming days, SAG-AFTRA members will vote on whether to accept their union's deal, which includes hefty gains, like increases in compensation for streaming shows and films, better health care funding, concessions from studios on self-taped auditions, and guarantees that studios will not use artificial intelligence to create digital replicas of their likenesses without payment or approval.
SAG-AFTRA, however, failed to receive a percentage of streaming service revenue. It had proposed a 2 percent share -- later dropped to 1 percent, before a pivot to a per-subscriber fee. Fran Drescher, the union's president, had made the demand a priority, but companies like Netflix balked, calling it "a bridge too far."
Instead, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of entertainment companies, proposed a new residual for streaming programs based on performance metrics, which the union, after making some adjustments, agreed to take.
At 118 days, it was the longest movie and television strike in the union's 90-year history. SAG-AFTRA said in a terse statement that its negotiating committee had voted unanimously to approve the tentative deal, which will proceed to the union's national board on Friday for "review and consideration."
It added, "Further details will be released following that meeting."
Shaan Sharma, a member of the union's negotiating committee, said he had mixed emotions about the tentative deal, though he declined to go into specifics because the SAG-AFTRA board still needed to review it.
"They say a negotiation is when both sides are unhappy because you can't get everything you want on either side," he said, adding, "You can be happy for the deal overall, but you can feel a sense of loss for something that you didn't get that you thought was important."
Ms. Drescher, who had been active on social media during the strike, didn't immediately post anything on Wednesday evening. She and other SAG-AFTRA officials had come under severe pressure from agents, crew member unions and even some of her own members, including George Clooney and Ben Affleck, to wrap up what had started to feel like an interminable negotiation.
"I'm relieved," Kevin Zegers, an actor most recently seen in the ABC show "The Rookie: Feds," said in an interview after the union's announcement. "If it didn't end today, there would have been riots."
The studio alliance said in a statement that the tentative agreement "represents a new paradigm," giving SAG-AFTRA "the biggest contract-on-contract gains in the history of the union."
There is uncertainty over what a poststrike Hollywood will look like. But one thing is certain: There will be fewer jobs for actors and writers in the coming years, undercutting the wins that unions achieved at the bargaining table.
Even before the strikes, entertainment companies were cutting back on the number of television shows they ordered, a result of severe pressure from Wall Street to turn money-losing streaming services into profitable businesses. Analysts expect companies to make up for the pair of pricey new labor contracts by reducing costs elsewhere, including by making fewer shows and canceling first-look deals.
For the moment, however, the agreements with actors and writers represent a capitulation by Hollywood's biggest companies, which started the bargaining process with an expectation that the unions, especially SAG-AFTRA, would be relatively compliant. Early in the talks, for instance, the studio alliance -- Netflix, Disney, NBCUniversal, Apple, Amazon, Sony, Paramount, Warner Bros. -- refused to negotiate on multiple union proposals. "Rejected our proposal, refused to make a counter" became a rallying cry among the striking workers.
As the studio alliance tried to limit any gains, the companies cited business challenges, including the rapid decline of cable television and continued streaming losses. Disney, struggling with $ 4 billion in streaming losses in 2022, eliminated 7,000 jobs in the spring.
But the alliance underestimated the pent-up anger pulsating among the studios' own workers. Writers and actors called the moment "existential," arguing that the streaming era had deteriorated the working conditions and compensation for rank-and-file members of their professions so much that they could no longer make a living. The companies brushed such comments aside as union bluster and Hollywood dramatics. They found out the workers were serious.
With the strikes dragging into the fall and the financial pain on both sides mounting, the studio alliance reluctantly switched from trying to limit gains to figuring out how to get Hollywood's creative assembly lines running again -- even if that meant bending to the will of the unions.
"It was all macho, tough-guy stuff from the companies for a while," said Jason E. Squire, professor emeritus at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts. "But that certainly did change."
There had previously been 15 years of labor peace in Hollywood.
"The executives of these companies didn't need to worry about labor very much -- they worried about other things," Chris Keyser, a chair of the Writers Guild negotiating committee, said in an interview after the writers' strike concluded. "They worried about Wall Street and their free cash flow, and all of that."
Mr. Keyser continued: "They could say to their labor executives, 'Do the same thing you've been doing year after year. Just take care of that, because labor costs are not going to be a problem.' Suddenly, that wasn't true anymore." As a result of the strikes, studios are widely expected to overhaul their approach to union negotiations, which in many ways dates to the 1980s.
Writers Guild leaders called their deal "exceptional" and "transformative," noting the creation of viewership-based streaming bonuses and a sharp increase in royalty payments for overseas viewing on streaming services. Film writers received guaranteed payment for a second draft of screenplays, something the union had tried but failed to secure for at least two decades.
The Writers Guild said the contract included enhancements worth roughly $ 233 million annually. When bargaining started in the spring, the guild proposed $ 429 million in enhancements, while studios countered with $ 86 million, according to the guild.
For an industry upended by the streaming revolution, which the pandemic sped up, the tentative accord takes a meaningful step toward stabilization. About $ 10 billion in TV and film production has been on hold, according to ProdPro, a production tracking service. That amounts to 176 shows and films.
The fallout has been significant, both inside and outside the industry. California's economy alone has lost more than $ 5 billion, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Because the actors' union prohibited its members from participating in promotional campaigns for already-finished work, studios pulled movies like "Dune: Part Two" from the fall release schedule, forgoing as much as $ 1.6 billion in worldwide ticket sales, according to David A. Gross, a film consultant.
With labor harmony restored, the coming weeks should be chaotic. Studio executives and producers will begin a mad scramble to secure soundstages, stars, insurance, writers and crew members so productions can start running again as quickly as possible. Because of the end-of-year holidays, some projects may not restart until January.
Both sides will have to go through the arduous process of working together again after a searing six-month standoff. The strikes tore at the fabric of the clubby entertainment world, with actors' union leaders describing executives as "land barons of a medieval time," and writers and actors still fuming that it took studio executives months, not weeks, to reach a deal.
Workers and businesses caught in the crossfire were idled, potentially leaving bitter feelings toward both sides.
And it appears that Hollywood executives will now have to contend with a resurgent labor force, mirroring many other American businesses. In recent weeks, production workers at Walt Disney Animation voted to unionize, as did visual-effects workers at Marvel.
Contracts with powerful unions that represent Hollywood crews will expire in June and July, and negotiations are expected to be fractious.
"It seemed apparent early on that we were part of a trend in American society where labor was beginning to flex its muscles -- where unions were beginning to reassert their power," said Mr. Keyser, the Writers Guild official.

LOS ANGELES — One of the longest labor crises in Hollywood history is finally coming to an end.
The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the union representing tens of thousands of actors, reached a tentative deal for a new contract with entertainment companies Wednesday, clearing the way for the $134 billion American movie and television business to swing back into motion.
Hollywood’s assembly lines have been at a near-standstill since May because of a pair of strikes by writers and actors, resulting in financial pain for studios and for many of the 2 million Americans — makeup artists, set builders, location scouts, chauffeurs, casting directors — who work in jobs directly or indirectly related to making TV shows and films.

Full text: Syreeta Singleton, the showrunner of the Max sitcom "Rap Sh!t," discusses why the show's aspiring rap stars are going on tour in the new season.
When "Rap Sh!t" premiered in July 2022, the sitcom embraced Miami's Black cultural landscape, as well as the recent female MC renaissance, with a rags-to-slightly-nicer-rags tale of two locals chasing a hip-hop dream.
Shawna, a disillusioned hotel clerk played by Aida Osman, and Mia, a struggling single mother played by the Florida rapper KaMillion, are two mismatched former classmates who stumble into the spotlight when their cobbled-together demo goes viral with the help of their scrappy manager, Chastity (Jonica Booth).
Created and executive produced by Issa Rae and loosely inspired by the lives of the Miami rap duo City Girls (who serve as executive producers), the series is filled with check-chasing raw ambition, sex-positive exploits and social-media fixation.
When last we saw them, Mia was finally ready to ditch her makeup-artist and OnlyFans side gigs to fully commit to the rap game, while Shawna's botched credit-card-scamming spree had her running from the law (literally, and in heels).
In Season 2, premiering Thursday on Max, the group hits the road for an ego-puncturing, relationship-testing quest for a bigger platform. While embarking on their first-ever tour -- reluctantly backing the oblivious white rapper Reina Reign (Kat Cunning) -- they endure a barrage of indignities including cultural appropriation, misogyny, zero-star accommodations and music industry bamboozlement.
According to the showrunner, Syreeta Singleton, who also wrote the season premiere, the story arc stemmed from anecdotes shared by Chris Sanford, one of the show's writers, who once worked as a tour manager.
"He had so many stories about getting an up-close look of how artists deal with the stress of being on tour buses for months at a time and what happens backstage," said Singleton, who had previously worked with Rae as an "Insecure" story editor. "Those stories were so exciting, but we couldn't use them in Season 1 because the girls were literally starting at the bottom and trying to figure out how to be a group."
Unlike Season 1, which was filmed on location in Miami, this season was largely shot in and around the Sony studio lot in Los Angeles-adjacent Culver City during the winter of 2023. The venue swap was a budgetary decision, Singleton said. The native Angeleno said she was serious about accurately replicating the Magic City on her home turf.
"I'd be like, 'Miami doesn't have those trees! Miami would never have that curb!"' she said. "I think I was really annoying at a certain point. Not only do I care as a storyteller about getting it right, I love that city."
While sipping an almond macadamia latte outside a Downtown Los Angeles coffee shop, Singleton discussed the season's "all that glitters" allegory. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
If Season 1 was rooted in authentically representing Miami culture, what was the focus this time around?
One of the things for the characters is that the [touring] environment really tests their sense of self -- who they are, what they're willing to do, how far they want to go. You're close to the thing that you want, you can see it in front of you, but you're not quite there yet. It's watching how much they're willing to compromise for this goal, which I think is relevant for Shawna, Mia and Chastity. But Shawna, especially. We saw her start off as this person who was like, "I don't even want people to look at me. It's only about the statement that I'm making, and it's political and I want to rile people up and get them to pay attention to these issues." But with the desire to make it, now she's slowly letting that go and no longer standing up for that.
If you tell someone, "I'm going on tour," there's what that looks like on social media -- how many likes you can get because people are now all of a sudden paying attention to you -- then there's what that actually looks like. Mia's stomach is growling. Shawna doesn't have tampons. That's what people don't see. The music industry is at a really interesting place right now because it really does feel like it's social-media driven, and you gotta fake it 'til you make it.
Did the touring narrative make this season more challenging to shoot?
Season 1 was written before shooting; this time, there was overlap. Everything was happening at once and everything was happening here in Los Angeles. We're "on the road," but we recreated Portland and Oakland. I really felt like I was pulled in so many directions -- scouting locations, going into the writers' room to work on Episode 6, then going back on set and shooting Episode 2. After last season I was like, "I got this under my belt, I'm gonna go into Season 2 so much more confident!" But then the universe was like, "OK, you accomplished that level, now do it in L.A., fake Miami, fake all of these different cities, do it all at once and do it in the freezing cold because it's January."
What is your work dynamic with Issa like?
I'm there for the day-to-day and I run the writers' room. How we work varies depending on what's on her plate, because Issa's everywhere. She looks over outlines and drafts and gives notes like all of the other producers, but she gets her eyes on it first. We have the closest communication when it comes to talking about the characters, where we want to go and the stories we want to tell -- so we're partners in that way. She's a super hands-on producer, and obviously this is her baby.
Have you adopted the baby? Do you consider it yours, too?
I've adopted the baby. I feel like I'm the baby's mom and she's my baby-daddy. She's a really good father but, you know, she has other kids!
Did any scenes this season particularly move you?
Mia's stuff with her mom and her own daughter -- the motherhood stuff really hits home for me, especially when it comes to sacrificing and leaving your kid behind to pursue a dream. Mia and I have that in common. My kids came with me to Miami, but then they had to go back and I was away from them or flying back and forth for three to four months. That was really hard for me. It's like, "Am I doing the right thing? Am I making the right choices? Are they going to be better because of this?"
Shawna and Mia emphasize women's sexual freedom in their lyrics and their private lives. Was that always part of the vision for the show, to depict them walking the walk, so to speak?
Yes. Issa and I, we're fans of female hip-hop. What do you feel when you're listening to a Cardi B or Megan Thee Stallion song? There's a lot of boasting; it's braggadocious. I'm listening to it when I'm going to work to try to pump myself up. When I'm at the gym, it's making me run that extra mile. These women are living a lifestyle of full empowerment. You can feel it in the music and that's what makes us feel good. I wanted to accurately represent the power that you feel when you're listening to that sort of music and the power that you imagine those women feel when they are being sexual and speaking about their sexuality without fear.
One [social media] comment I got that stuck with me was someone feeling like [the show's sexuality] was too much and that it's not good to represent Black women in this way. And I was like, "Am I doing us a disservice?" Then I was like, "Wait, who says we don't get to be sexual?" We're all human and that's a shared experience that most of us have. We are sexual beings, so I never want to shy away from that.
Did you get any feedback from female rappers after the first season? Anyone saying, "That is exactly how it is" or "You should've done this "?
No, not really. [The Florida-born rapper] TT the Artist did say some amazing things. I would love to hear from more female rappers. What I have heard -- from mostly men -- is that [the show] is so real, the not getting paid when you do work or having someone take the thing you did and not give you credit for it. Those are the things I hear a lot, so I feel like we're nailing the struggle!

Actors' Union Receives 'Best and Final' Offer From Studios: [National Desk]

Full text: SAG-AFTRA, which has been on strike for 114 days, did not give a timeline for when it would respond.
The negotiating committee of the actors' union, SAG-AFTRA, told its members on Saturday that it had received a "Last, Best and Final Offer" from the major entertainment studios as a strike that has brought much of Hollywood to a standstill continued for a 114th day.
"We are reviewing it and considering our response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our proposals," the negotiating committee said. They did not say when they would respond to the offer, which came after an hourlong video conference call that included top studio executives.
Included in the offer was a wage increase that could be the highest in four decades, according to a person familiar with the offer who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. The studios also offered the actors a new way to determine residuals for streaming programs based on performance metrics, and protections on artificial intelligence, including consent and compensation requirements. The studios also offered an increase to the pension and health funds.
The virtual meeting on Saturday featured the largest group of top entertainment executives yet to engage with the negotiating committee, underscoring the urgency with which the studios want to return to work in an effort to salvage the fall television season and ensure next summer's theatrical box office will not be disrupted.
Four executives have spearheaded the talks: NBCUniversal's Studio Group chairwoman and chief content officer, Donna Langley; the Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos; the Disney chief executive Robert A. Iger; and Warner Bros. Discovery's chief executive, David Zaslav. They were joined by the Paramount Pictures chief executive Brian Robbins; the co-chairs of entertainment for Disney, Dana Walden and Alan Bergman; Mike Hopkins and Jennifer Salke from Amazon Studios; the Sony Pictures chairman Tony Vinciquerra; and Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg of Apple Studios.
The entertainment business has been at a standstill for months because of strikes by writers, who walked out in May, and actors, who joined them in July. The writers' strike was resolved a little over a month ago, but the actors' work stoppage has continued to grind on, leaving thousands out of work for close to six months.

A Challenging Over-the-Counter Market for Hearing Aids: [Science Desk]

Author: Span, Paula

Publication info: Span, Paula. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/challenging-over-counter-market-hearing-aids/docview/2884030060/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Over-the-counter devices have been available for a year now. New research suggests they may have unexpected benefits.
A year ago, the Food and Drug Administration announced new regulations allowing the sale of over-the-counter hearing aids and setting standards for their safety and effectiveness.
That step -- which was supposed to take three years but required five -- portended cheaper, high-quality hearing aids that people with mild to moderate hearing loss could buy online or at local pharmacies and big stores.
So how's it going? It's a mixed picture.
Manufacturers and retailers have become serious about making hearing aids more accessible and affordable. Yet the O.T.C. market remains confusing, if not downright chaotic, for the mostly older consumers the new regulations were intended to help.
The past year also brought renewed focus on the importance of treating hearing loss, which affects two-thirds of people over age 70. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University published the first randomized clinical trial showing that hearing aids could help reduce the pace of cognitive decline.
Some background: In 2020, the influential Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention and Care identified hearing loss as the greatest potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia.
Previous studies had demonstrated a link between hearing loss and cognitive decline, said Dr. Frank Lin, an otolaryngologist and epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins and lead author of the new research.
"What remained unanswered was, If we treat hearing loss, does it actually reduce cognitive loss?" he said. The ACHIEVE study (for Aging and Cognitive Health Evaluation in Elders) showed that, at least for a particular group of older adults, it could.
Of nearly 1,000 people ages 70 to 84 with untreated mild to moderate hearing loss, half received hearing assessments from audiologists, were fitted with midpriced hearing aids and were counseled on how to use them for several months. The control group participated in a health education program.
Over three years, the study found that hearing-aid use had scant effect on healthy volunteers at low risk of cognitive loss. But among participants who were older and less affluent, hearing aids reduced the rate of cognitive decline by 48 percent, compared with the control group, a difference the researchers deemed "clinically meaningful."
This subset of participants had lower income and "were older, less educated, with higher rates of diabetes and hypertension," Dr. Lin said. Because such factors are also associated with dementia, "the people at higher risk really stand to benefit the most," he said.
In trying to slow cognitive decline, "with a lot of other therapies and treatments, we learn that they can be too little, too late," he added. ACHIEVE indicates that "they can still see the benefits later in life." Another three years of follow-up should reveal any further effects of hearing-aid use on both groups.
The researchers also plan to publish findings on how hearing-aid use affects brain atrophy, social isolation, depression and quality of life.
Some experts object to emphasizing a connection between dementia and hearing loss, "as though it plants a dementia seed and the hearing aid keeps it from germinating," said Dr. Jan Blustein, a medical researcher at the N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine.
Because of the stigma of dementia, "people who would potentially get treatment for hearing loss may be less likely to," Dr. Blustein said.
She added that enabling greater social interaction, with its known beneficial effects on cognition and mental health, is reason enough to promote hearing-aid use. Researchers at the University of Colorado also recently reported that consistent hearing-aid use by older adults was associated with a lower risk of falls.
But acquiring quality hearing aids over the counter, as opposed to more expensive prescription devices through an audiology practice, can still feel challenging.
The F.D.A. reviews "self-fitting" hearing aids, the kind users can customize with a smartphone app; it has found eight brands in compliance with regulations since 2022. A small study recently published in JAMA Otolaryngology found that patients who were given a commercially available, self-fitting hearing aid in a clinical trial could, after six weeks, hear as well as patients fitted with the same device by audiologists.
But not everyone with hearing loss feels comfortable with online sales and do-it-yourself adjustments via apps. And devices that aren't self-fitting, and instead use preset controls, don't undergo F.D.A. review at all.
"It's still Day 1 of the market's opening," said Barbara Kelley, executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America, an advocacy and support group. "The price points are all over. There's still confusion among consumers."
Adding to that uncertainty, some marketers have resorted to misleading advertising -- some claim that their devices restore natural hearing, for instance. No hearing aid can do that.
"There are bad actors," said Kate Carr, president of the Hearing Industries Association, which represents major manufacturers. "One company was advertising 'C.I.A. technology."' In response, the F.D.A. published a guide for consumers this year.
Still, progress. Self-fitting O.T.C. aids that perform well are now widely available for about $ 1,000 a pair; prescription hearing aids purchased through audiologists cost several times more.
Perhaps because older Americans don't know about or mistrust the new over-the-counter devices, or because they still find the price a barrier, initial sales appear modest. (Traditional Medicare doesn't cover hearing aids; Medicare Advantage plans offering hearing benefits still leave patients paying most of the costs.)
Lexie Hearing, a major manufacturer, sells self-fitting O.T.C. devices for $ 799 to $ 999 a pair online and in 14,000 stores nationwide. According to Seline van der Wat, the chief operating officer, the company is on track to sell 90,000 pairs this year.
But Lexie, whose hearing aids are designed and engineered by Bose, is encouraged by its findings that 94 percent of those buyers are first-time purchasers.
"We're finally able to access a part of the market that was previously unpenetrated because of the costs," she said. The company projects sales of 260,000 pairs next year and a million per year in 2027.
Other device makers and distributors are ramping up, too. Best Buy announced that 200 more of its stores began carrying O.T.C. hearing aids this summer, and that number will reach 600 this fall. The global vision company EssilorLuxottica plans to introduce hearing aids embedded in eyeglass earpieces late next year.
Several traditional manufacturers have also begun selling over-the-counter devices, sometimes teaming up with better-known consumer companies to promote brand recognition: WS Audiology with Sony, Sonova with Sennheiser. Some experts expect Apple, Sanyo or other consumer-electronics giants to enter the field.
To help guide buyers, HearAdvisor -- a company founded by two audiologists and a hearing scientist -- has built an independent acoustic lab in Rockford, Ill., to evaluate and rank both prescription and O.T.C. hearing aids for those with mild to moderate loss.
"We're trying to be the Good Housekeeping seal of approval for hearing aids," Andy Sabin, a co-founder, said.
After testing about 50 devices to date, HearAdvisor gave its "Expert Choice" award to 13. In general, O.T.C. devices that cost $ 1,000 or more perform well, Dr. Sabin said, while those sold online today for under $ 500 "are most often junk." A few may actually reduce intelligibility.
Wirecutter, a division of The New York Times, has also evaluated hearing aids, and the Hearing Loss Association has planned a series of webinars called OTC 101. The first, on Nov. 1, will feature F.D.A. regulators.
The United States is the first country to develop a regulated O.T.C. hearing aid market, and "the tech companies and the retailers are still experimenting," Dr. Lin pointed out. He predicts increased innovation and lower prices ahead.
At the moment, though, he said, "it's still very much a work in progress."

Full text: What better way to celebrate Halloween season than with a scary (or autumn-themed) video game? The staff from Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company, offered options for just about everyone.
Dead Space (2023)
The original Dead Space terrified players with its combination of "Aliens" and "28 Days Later," set within the survival horror gameplay of classics like Resident Evil 4. Remade with modern technology 15 years later, Dead Space (above right) feels even more vital, interesting and fun. ARTHUR GIES
Rated M; play it on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S
Death's Door
In the current era of gigantic open-world games that can take hundreds of hours to beat, I appreciate smaller games that nail their execution. My favorite entry of the past couple years is this action-adventure game, which stars a little crow with a giant sword on a quest to open the titular Death's Door. KIMBER STREAMS
Rated T; play it on Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S
Disney Dreamlight Valley
If you want to get spooky and keep things lighthearted, Disney Dreamlight Valley -- one of our favorite cozy games for kids and adults -- is offering a limited-time update in the spirit of Halloween. HALEY PERRY
Rated E; play it on Mac, Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
The Quarry
This game follows a group of teenage counselors who are alone in the woods on the last night of summer camp, and it plays like a choose-your-own-adventure horror flick. Most of the game is spent in cut scenes with dialogue options that determine how the story will pan out. HALEY PERRY
Rated M; play it on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
The Room
You're presented with a wooden box that unfolds into a beguiling puzzle. Solving it depends on finding hidden buttons and missing pieces while making sense of each new puzzle box. The game keeps an enjoyable spooky vibe throughout. MAX EDDY
Rated E; play it on Android, iOS, PC, Nintendo Switch

Full text: Igor Levit's latest amazement, an example of David Lang's raucous side and French love songs for voice and lute are among the highlights.
'Fantasia'
Igor Levit, piano (Sony)
Another year, another amazing album from Igor Levit. Like all this pianist's recording projects, "Fantasia" is daringly yet elegantly programmed: Eight works from across some 200 years, with four meaty masterpieces each set alongside a smaller companion.
The album begins almost teasingly -- if unsurprisingly, for a musician who has released the ubiquitous "Für Elise" as a single -- with Bach's evergreen "Air for the G String," leading into a sumptuously glamorous account of that composer's Chromatic Fantasy and Fugue in D minor. Liszt's brooding transcription of Schubert's song "Der Doppelgänger" emerges out of the shadowy ending of Liszt's B minor Sonata, its grandeur and intimacy both captured here. Then comes more B minor, with a tiny Berg "Klavierstück" as a sip of aperitif before his Opus 1 Sonata, lucid but never chilly. A Busoni aficionado, Levit brings tautness without rigidity to tame the sprawling, potentially meandering, Bach-loving "Fantasia Contrappuntistica," before closing with Busoni's "Nuit de Noël," another chromatic fantasia, gently snowy.
This is playing of rigorous, solemn control and, at the same time, endless seduction. Levit is always persuasive, giving even the most standard repertory the spark of revelation, and his poetic phrasing and touch convey both mysteries and immense satisfactions. ZACHARY WOOLFE
David Lang: 'man made'
So Percussion; Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra; Louis Langrée, conductor (Fanfare)
David Lang, the composer and co-founder of the Bang on a Can collective, has excelled at writing generally quiet music, like his aptly titled "the whisper opera" and his Pulitzer Prize-winning oratorio "the little match girl passion." But I'm still a sucker for his punchier music -- a more raucous side that has been featured on pieces like "cheating, lying, stealing" (1995), or this new EP from the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra's label.
That's not to say that Lang's 23-minute "man made," a concerto for percussion quartet, rages from start to finish. It opens with the group So Percussion gently snapping some twigs. This celebrated ensemble is skilled at eliciting sonic theatricality from such textural conceits, but they can lay down a thwacking beat, too, as they do here. In its early minutes, "man made" turns to stark, barely connected percussive explosions, with the orchestra seeming to learn its material from the quartet.
Gradually, this process-music approach results in a grand, galvanizing communion. About midway through, you can find a joyous, extended section of revelry in which no one leads or follows. The music is vertiginous, and full of zigzagging motion, yet its grooving center holds. Credit to the players, under the baton of the Cincinnati Symphony's music director, Louis Langrée. In contemporary pieces, like this one and Christopher Cerrone's "A Body. Moving," Langrée has shown how the light touch he routinely offers in Mozart can be used to grand effect in modern American music. SETH COLTER WALLS
'Solo'
Isabelle Faust, violin (Harmonia Mundi)
There is no sure path to a satisfying encounter with unfamiliar music. More often than not, though, putting yourself in the hands of a supremely intelligent and curious artist will yield happy results. Such was my experience with Isabelle Faust's new recording of solo violin works from the second half of the Baroque period. This is territory that many of us associate primarily with Bach, but Faust's sampler of the vast store of other European music from this era -- virtually all of it previously unknown to me -- is sheer delight.
Whether by design or by chance, "Solo" also presents an unusually comprehensive picture of what makes Faust such a multifaceted and captivating musician. A series of "Ayres for the Violin" by Nicola Matteis the Elder and a fantasia by his son (consisting solely of arpeggios) show her gift for lyrical eloquence. In dance-flavored works by Louis-Gabriel Guillemain, she knows just when to roughen her tone to something darker and grittier, to superb expressive effect. A sonata by Johann Georg Pisendel and a partita by Johann Joseph Vilsmayr give us templates familiar from Bach; and while a few movements almost sound like they could be from his pen, most of this music is refreshingly airy and straightforward, and Faust plays it with a deft touch. The one well-known item here is the passacaglia that concludes Biber's "Rosary" Sonatas, transfixing music that she renders with equal parts virtuosity and tranquillity. DAVID WEININGER
'Idylle'
Lea Desandre, mezzo-soprano; Thomas Dunford, lute (Erato)
The mezzo-soprano Lea Desandre and the lutenist Thomas Dunford count among today's French classical music couples -- see also: the conductor Raphaël Pichon and the soprano Sabine Devielhe -- who are blending the personal and professional with a result that, so far, is only benefiting audiences.
Desandre and Dunford are performing at Carnegie Hall next week, but ready now is this centuries-spanning survey of French love songs. Relentlessly beautiful, extremely French, and restricted to the sounds of voice and lute, the program can feel flattened, yet you'd be hard-pressed to resist its sexy allure and intimacy.
Unsurprisingly, these artists excel in 17th-century works. Dunford's serene, upward strums accompany Desandre's pure melodic lines and gentle turns of musical phrase in Honoré d'Ambruys's "Le doux silence de nos bois"; and they lend folky -- whistling! -- freedom to Charpentier's "Auprès du feu l'on fait l'amour."
Then there are pop songs and light music of the 20th century. An excerpt from André Messager "L'amour masqué" comes off as a standard of carefree whimsy; material previously sung by Françoise Hardy and Barbara makes for chic performances straight out of a cafe. At points, the modern intriguingly creeps into the Baroque. Charpentier's "Sans frayeur dans ce bois," with its gently plucked opening, narrow vocal range and speechlike rhythms, could have been written by Taylor Swift. And Michel Lambert's "Ma bergère est tendre et fidèle," in which a gritty exclamation is followed by a lightly flowing high tune, feels like an ancestor of Kate Bush. JOSHUA BARONE
'Dynamic Maximum Tension'
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society (Nonesuch)
The bandleader Darcy James Argue is one of the great living composers for chamber orchestra. His eponymous Secret Society band -- built on examples from the likes of Duke Ellington and Maria Schneider -- records infrequently. But when Argue enters a studio, he tends to make sessions count.
This time, he and his collaborators have concocted an 11-track set that makes use of Argue's supple ear for orchestration. If you're a '90s alt-rock kid, a transition to saxophone-led strut -- midway through the opening number, "Dymaxion" -- may make you wonder: Is this a tip of the hat to Morphine? (Indeed, Argue is a fan of that band.) The next track, "All In," is a testament to the late trumpeter Laurie Frink, but it also has some of the post-minimalist energy of the Bang on a Can cohort of composers. (Argue has also declared himself their fan.)
The big-band eminence Bob Brookmeyer is the dedicatee of "Winged Beasts" -- and that piece's inventive thematic transformation shows what Argue likely learned as one of Brookmeyer's students. The album's second half is dominated by the majestic, half-hour "Tensile Curves" -- a tribute and response to Ellington's "Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue." But don't let it overshadow smaller slow-burners like "Ferromagnetic" or the inventive, swinging jewel "Mae West: Advice," which features the vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant. SETH COLTER WALLS

Flamenco Roots Raising a Ruckus: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: This Spanish singer's debut, "Ultrabelleza," experiments with a signature genre of her Andalusian homeland, creating an unexpected homage.
When the Spanish singer María José Llergo talks about flamenco, it often sounds as though she is describing something springing from beneath her feet. "The genre is rooted in my land," she said, in a video call from her place just outside Madrid. "It's in our roots."
Growing up in rural Andalusia, where flamenco was born, Llergo first became interested in music while watching her grandfather work on his farm. "I remember him raking the earth, watering the plants and singing -- everything from tangos to boleros," she said, speaking in Spanish. Life for him wasn't exactly easy back then. "My grandparents come from very humble -- albeit very happy -- origins," said Llergo, surrounded by family portraits. She comes from that world too.
Llergo, now 29, has developed a voice and singing style of her own, but she's intent on keeping regional traditions alive. Infusing electronica and R&B with traditional Andalusian influences -- including flamenco snaps and the off-kilter melodies of cante jondo, a guttural singing style common to folk music in the south of Spain -- Llergo's 2020 EP "Sanación" is a testament to the versatility of flamenco as a genre. "Ultrabelleza," her debut album out Friday, takes this experiment a step further.
The record's lead single, "Rueda, Rueda," begins with a chant and handclaps before a sprawling pop chorus arrives. On tracks like "Visión y Reflejo," Llergo even tries her hand at rapping. "María had never done it before," the Spanish indie singer Zahara, who was one of the album's main producers, said in a video call. "But she managed to do it in one take when we were recording the song. It was super impressive."
Llergo said she knows she isn't the first person to traverse genres -- and she's not just talking about the Catalan pop star Rosalía, whose debut album, "El Mal Querer," is often credited with catapulting flamenco into 21st-century global pop. (Incidentally, she and Llergo both studied at the Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya in Barcelona under the same mentor, José Miguel Vizcay.)
"Flamenco has always lent itself to other styles. All you have to do to find proof of that is look back at people like Lola Flores and Camarón," Llergo said, referring to Camarón de la Isla, the singer often credited as the 20th century's "god" of flamenco. "It's always been global."
During the 1970s and '80s, Camarón de la Isla, a Romani from Cádiz whose stage name is Spanish for "shrimp," breathed new life into flamenco by adding instruments not traditionally found in the genre, such as the drums and bass guitar, to his recordings. His heartfelt lyrics and acrobatic vocal range would also eventually earn him a reputation as one of the country's top crooners: In his best-known song, "Como el Água," he compares the strength of his love for someone to a river running through the sierra.
Llergo tends to speak in that language, too, drawing from the rich natural landscapes of southern Spain to tell stories about herself, her hometown and the people in it. "I run through your body like water runs through a river," she sings in the synth-heavy "Juramento," in a nod to her predecessor.
While "Juramento" and other songs on the record don't necessarily sound like flamenco, Llergo knows there are different ways artists can pay homage to the genre. Drawing clear demarcations around who or what fits into it isn't one of them. "It's flamenco's ability to mix into other genres that makes it more appealing on a global level," she said.
From the plucky guitar riffs on Madonna's 1987 hit "La Isla Bonita" to the handclaps, or palmas, on Caroline Polachek's "Sunset" from earlier this year, there's a long history of American pop artists' experimenting with flamenco. As the market becomes friendlier to Spanish-language pop, listeners might find themselves looking for more of the genre.
"Folk music in general -- take regional Mexican music, for example -- is becoming increasingly popular," said Manuel Jubera, Llergo's A&R at Sony Music Spain, in a recent phone interview. "So it's a good moment for flamenco to export itself." Next year Llergo will bring her music directly to the United States with a show at the Luckman Fine Arts Complex in Los Angeles in March and one at Le Poisson Rouge in New York the following week.
"I remember the first time I went to New York, I couldn't stop crying and taking videos on my phone," she said. "I still think about the way the sun reflects on the buildings there." (When she's on the road, she misses home, though. She beckoned her 1-year-old Chihuahua, Torres, to show him off on camera, but he was nowhere to be found.)
When Llergo was in New York, she found herself reflecting on the culture of her homeland. "I thought about Federico García Lorca a lot," she said, referring to his book, "Poet in New York," written during a 10-month stint in the city in 1929.
Like Llergo, García Lorca came from Andalusia. "And do you know what the street I grew up in in Pozoblanco is called?" she asked, looking straight at the camera, her eyebrows rising. "Federico García Lorca."
These types of connections -- including ones between America and Spain -- are often on her mind. "Flamenco is like the blues," she said. It originated in Andalusia's marginalized Roma communities. "The lyrics tell stories of survival -- it's always been a way for the most oppressed to escape." Llergo, who said she faced discrimination at school because of her lower-class background, still finds solace in them.
Like many people, she also appreciates the communal nature of flamenco, an idea grounded in the concept of el jaleo, roughly "hell-raising" or causing a ruckus, which refers to the audience's hand-clapping, foot-stomping shouts of encouragement during a performance.
Over the years, a number of people have encouraged Llergo to raise hell too, and when she looks to the future, she can't help but feel grateful for them. "It's crazy," she said. "To think that when my grandfather was watering the plants in his field, he was also nurturing me."

The In-Between Is Where This Director Excels: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: In her new film, Maryam Keshavarz finds both gravity and levity in the struggle to reconcile her Iranian heritage and her life in the United States.
When Leila, the central character in the new comedy-drama "The Persian Version," sashays across the Brooklyn Bridge and into a Halloween party carrying a surfboard and wearing a burkini -- niqab on top, bikini on the bottom -- while Wet Leg's cheeky anthem "Chaise Longue" plays, it's clear that what's to come will be a boundary-pushing take on straddling cultures that are at odds in the real world.
Maryam Keshavarz wore a similar burkini costume once upon a time, and her semi-autobiographical film -- which spans decades and moves between Iran and the United States -- won an audience award and a screenwriting prize at the Sundance Film Festival in January, where it had its world premiere. The film, written and directed by Keshavarz, will have a limited theatrical release in the United States on Friday.
"The reality is, I've never really followed the rules," Keshavarz, 48, who was born in New York to Iranian parents, told me in a video call earlier this month. "It's also the reason that probably I've been able to get to where I am, because there's no real path for us, is there? There's no straight path if you're an immigrant kid, if you're queer, if you're an outsider."
Keshavarz was an adult when she grasped that immigrants and women could be directors. "I thought that was stuff for white Americans," she said. "Even the idea that we have a right to tell our story and to take up space is huge."
Women who follow the rules "would be crushed," she came to understand. "It's a society that doesn't allow us to get what we need to survive and flourish. So we have to take things into our own hands."
Here are edited excerpts from our conversation. Light spoilers ahead.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Your film is arriving at a time when there's heightened attention on the oppression Iranian girls and women face: The imprisoned Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi , who focuses on women's rights in Iran, recently received the Nobel Peace Prize, and this month, a 16-year-old girl entered a subway car in Tehran with her hair uncovered and was later dragged out unconscious. How does your film fit with this larger picture?
Of course, we are so grateful that the international voices have been used to amplify what's going on in Iran in the last year, but this has been an ongoing issue ever since I can remember, we've been fighting against in Iran -- all the morality police and, at every level, women, because they're the symbol of the Islamic culture with the hair-covering and everything -- have been on the forefront of pushing back.
If you look at my film, my mother in the '60s, she's fighting against cultural norms to have her place in society. It's not a battle that's won in a day. And particularly young women, I'm in awe of them. The young girl who plays my mother at 14 (Kamand Shafieisabet), she lives in Iran, and she could have stayed in America, but she decided to go back after Sundance. She said, "It's my duty to fight in my country."
More than anything, this is an international issue. The reason it's caught fire around the world is because it's not just about Iran. We also have issues here in the U.S. I think finally we understand that there's more of an interconnectivity in our struggles.
Kamand Shafieisabet has the film's most dramatic moments. What was casting like for you, since you were essentially casting your own family?
Everyone is Iranian. I was really dedicated to have actual Iranians. It didn't matter what diaspora they were in, and it was so meaningful for them because all of us grew up in different countries.
[Shafieisabet] lived and breathed this character, and she joked, "I'm giving birth to a child, and I've never kissed a boy." She's never acted. She was literally a freshman in high school. I wanted someone that was that innocent to play my mother, because my mother truly was at that time.
When my mother met her -- and my mom's very verbose -- I said, "Mom, you're so quiet. What's wrong?" And she said, "You know what? I never realized how young I was until I saw this girl. I was her age. I was a child. I was always struggling so hard to survive. I never had a moment to reflect."
Why is it important for you to elevate the stories of those who exist in that very particular space between cultures?
To me, that's quintessentially what it means to be American. You come to America and you're allowed in many ways to continue your original national identity and still become American, and preserve those two things side by side. Also I wanted to take back the narrative of what it meant to be American. But more than anything, when you're from two different places, you're a bit of an outsider of both. And you do see the absurdity of both sides in some ways, and you understand it probably more than others would. So in some ways you become a translator of both cultures.
Even Leila being a lesbian who gets pregnant by a man, as you did, plays in that in-between space.
My family was so confused. That's really the truth. Because I've been so adamantly with a woman and had been married and queer. We went out for drinks, and I was about to wimp out. Then the father of my daughter was like, "You've got to tell them." I was like, "I'll send them email." And I did blurt it out just like that. Then they thought he was gay. They were so confused. The story of my life. As confused as me. [Laughs]
That was very hard for me even to say "bisexual" for a long time. I was like, no, I'm queer. Also because of politics. It's important that we have a sense of gay rights, regardless of the spectrum that you're on. I'm from an older generation; my daughter's generation has a completely different perspective on it. It was very important for me just to be adamant about our political rights as a community. But I realized life is more messy than the political movements allow us to be.
You balance a lot of opposing themes: duality of identity, of course, but also comedy and drama, as well as different cinematic tones as we move through time and locales. Was it a struggle to bite off so much?
I struggled with two things. One was the balance of the comedy and the drama. Another was to have an epic tale that was so intimate. That was very important for me, not to get lost in the period detail but to know that this is a story of essentially three women and to really ground it. And to do that, I decided that each character would have a different genre that's reflective of who they are: So that the daughter is more '80s-'90s pop. The grandmother is a tall teller of tales, as all grandmothers are, so she gets a spaghetti western. And then the mother, who, even though she's created a new identity, is still traumatized by an old past -- what you typically think of Persian films, which is like [an Abbas] Kiarostami sort of film.
For me, it was important that all three women get to tell at least their version of the story. When I was writing it, I couldn't crack the story until I realized my mother was the other writer. Because she came to this country to write her own future, rewrite her life. Once I got that, everything else fell into place. I realized all the men are just a chorus to our stories. And typically, it's the other way around.
On that note, do you really have eight brothers?
In real life, I have seven brothers. In the story, I have eight. But I did grow up with one bathroom. I'm very traumatized to this day. I just have to have my own bathroom. [Laughs]
The chaos of many siblings adds levity for sure. The movie, despite tackling serious topics, is also largely a comedy packed with big food scenes, choreographed dance sequences and tons of music, including Wet Leg at the start, but also Cyndi Lauper and Gagoosh.
Certainly when I was a kid, Iran was synonymous with terrorist. And that was not my experience of Iran or Iranians. I'm like, "We're so lazy. How can we be terrorists? We like to take long naps after lunch." But honestly, it's not the people I know; it's not the culture and the celebration, the music, food. That's a real political thing, too, what aspects of our culture are shown. I mean, if we can dehumanize people, it's so much easier to invade them and to kill them and to take their oil and to create nameless wars, faceless wars. So I think the reason I went into cinema post-9/11 was to create a more nuanced view of our world. This film is in some ways a culmination of my entire career. I don't believe in all this divisive rhetoric, and I feel like humor is a way that we can connect.

Full text: Curators and conservators are working to save -- and update -- art made with aging hardware.
UP A BUCKLING flight of stairs on Murray Street in Lower Manhattan, the dusty workshop of CTL Electronics is crammed with once-novel relics: cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions, three-beam projectors and laserdisc players from the previous century. Hundreds of outdated monitors are arranged beside money trees and waving maneki neko cats, an installation in a kind of mini-museum run by CTL's proprietor, Chi-Tien Lui, who has worked as a TV and radio repairman since immigrating from Taiwan in 1961. At CTL, which he opened in 1968, Lui initially sold closed-circuit TV systems and video equipment, but for the past couple of decades, his business has had a unique focus: repairing video artworks that, since the onset of the digital age, are increasingly likely to malfunction and decay.
Many of CTL's clients are museums looking to restore works by a single artist, the video art pioneer Nam June Paik, who died in 2006. Known for his sculptures and room-size installations of flickering CRT monitors, Paik began visiting the shop in the 1970s on breaks from his studio in nearby SoHo. While some conservators have updated his work by replacing old tubes with LCD screens, Lui is one of the only technicians who can rebuild Paik's sets from spare parts, as if they were new.
Paik's work was on view, along with video works from dozens of other artists, in "Signals," a sweeping exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York earlier this year. Many pieces in the show, such as those in the video collectives section, played on boxy Sony CRT monitors, long favored by artists for their austere, stackable design, and which stopped being produced in the 2000s. The cube CRTs are essentially worthless to consumers, but museums are willing to pay a premium for them on eBay -- "if you can even get your hands on one," said Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, who helped organize the show. "I had to tell security, 'Pretend these are Donald Judds,' because they're basically priceless at this point."
It's an ongoing dilemma for the modern-art institution: New technologies are only ever new for so long. When the phaseout of the incandescent light bulb, a go-to material for artists from Robert Rauschenberg to Felix Gonzalez-Torres, began in 2012, museums either amassed stockpiles of the old bulbs or found a reliable supplier. Dan Flavin, who spent his entire career working with fluorescent light, always had his preferred manufacturers. Last year, the Biden administration proposed as part of its climate policy a sunsetting of compact fluorescents, and a few states have recently enacted legislation that in the coming years will also ban the longer tube lights that Flavin used. For now, museums continue to go through the estate of the artist, who died in 1996, to replace burned-out lights. Not all artists are so precious about their materials, however: In 2012, when Diana Thater presented her 1992 video installation "Oo Fifi, Five Days in Claude Monet's Garden" at the Los Angeles gallery 1301PE, where it had first been shown 20 years earlier, she updated its clunky CRT projectors to digital ones. She digitized the video, a collage of film footage from Monet's garden in Giverny, France -- itself a technological update of the Impressionist painter's vistas in oil -- because, she said, "I don't want my work to look fake old." Paik, for his part, left behind a page of instructions specifying that his works could be updated, as long as the integrity of the original look of the sculpture was respected, to the best of what the technology would allow.
In conserving works made with more mundane materials, museums generally rely on an artist like Thater or on the artist's estate to provide guidance -- or even the materials themselves, as is the case with Flavin. But technology now moves at a much faster pace. A museum's task of protecting art in perpetuity has remained fixed, even as artists' materials have changed. Art institutions are likely the only places in the world that are currently planning how they might be able to fix an Oculus Rift 50 years from now. Rather than keep stockpiles of expensive and obsolete technology in storage, museums have to find clever ways around software updates, from video game emulators to server farms to niche businesses like CTL. But they, too, have a life span as short as, or shorter than, those of light bulbs. There are far more obscure materials for artists to choose from than ever before.
GLENN WHARTON WAS hired in 2007 as MoMA's first conservator of time-based media, or works that often depend on commercial technology that can have a limited shelf life. "I saw the writing on the wall that it was hard to even buy videotapes anymore," Wharton said. In the early days, he was making decisions "about changing the works of art" that were the equivalent of a painting conservator using acrylic instead of oil paint: "We were swapping out CRTs and sometimes moving toward flat-screen technology, or changing projectors or even digitizing." Ultimately, Wharton decided, "defining the authentic state of a work of art is central to what conservators do." So when the museum acquired a work dependent on a specific technology from a living artist, he'd ask how they wanted it to be conserved and displayed.
Wharton now runs a program at U.C.L.A. that has helped to clarify one of the main issues in the emerging field of digital conservation: digital obsolescence. If certain art is dependent on an extinct technology, how does one preserve the art so that it outlasts the technology itself? Sometimes by addressing a phenomenon called bit rot: As Caroline Gil, the director of media collections and preservation at the New York nonprofit Electronic Arts Intermix, explained, "Digital files of all stripes are made up of data -- zeros and ones -- and, every so often, a zero can turn into a one through electrostatic discharge in your hard drive or in a big server farm. That corrupts the file." There are methods for fixing this, she said, "but that's a very niche level of understanding, and I don't think a lot of archives or collecting institutions do that, really."
Coding expertise is still uncommon in museum conservation departments, but that may have to change. "The art world is kind of running on an old operating system of Modernism," said Cass Fino-Radin, a conservator and founder of the upstate New York firm Small Data Industries, even as museums are collecting newer artworks that, at their core, are composed of code. In 2016, the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York contacted Fino-Radin for help with a two-year-long assessment of digital materials in its permanent collection. The project included a detailed case study of a defunct iOS app called Planetary, acquired by the museum in 2013, which allowed users to browse a music library like astronauts soaring through the Milky Way. Debuting in 2011, Planetary had been rendered incompatible with iOS software updates within a few years, so the museum decided to share the source code on GitHub for anyone to try to fix it. Ultimately, it was an Australian developer, Kemal Enver, who got it functioning again, releasing it in 2020 as Planetary Remastered. To Fino-Radin, it was a warning sign: "For museums, hiring a professional software developer to do that kind of annual maintenance isn't something that's ever been remotely needed in history, and so institutions just don't have the money to do it. It's a new line item in their budgets."
For works dependent on old hardware, conservators sometimes rely on a method known as emulation: "You're fooling a current computer into thinking that it's running on an older system, meaning I can turn my MacBook Pro into a virtual machine where I can run a net art piece in a Netscape 1.1 browser," said Christiane Paul, the curator of digital art at the Whitney Museum of American Art. This approach was adopted at Rhizome, a New York nonprofit dedicated to promoting and preserving digital art, which in 2012 presented (along with the New Museum of Contemporary Art) an online exhibition of interactive computer games for preteen girls co-created by Theresa Duncan that had first been released on CD-ROM in the mid-1990s. Visitors to the Rhizome website can play Chop Suey, a delirious adventure through a small Ohio town, by connecting virtually to a server running the game on its 1995 software.
Many artists don't think about what will happen to their work when they are gone. Or they never imagined certain pieces having much of a future. In "Super Mario Clouds" (2002), an early video installation by the artist Cory Arcangel, the 1985 Super Mario Bros. video game plays off a Nintendo console with all of the game's animated features, apart from sky and clouds, erased. Obsolescence was partly the point of the work because, as a then-unknown artist, Arcangel didn't expect to be showing it 20 years later -- and by 2002 the consoles "were considered trash," he said. An edition of "Super Mario Clouds" was bought by the Whitney, whose conservators were aware that the console might not function much longer. But the source code remains available, and Arcangel has granted the museum permission to use a Nintendo emulator to show the work.
Yet is an emulated artwork, even if indistinguishable from the original, really the same artwork? This riddle is sometimes known as the paradox of Theseus's ship: According to Plutarch's legend, as the Athenians preserved their former king's boat through the decades by gradually replacing its decaying old planks with new ones, philosophers wondered, could the ship still be considered authentic if none of its original parts remained?
The conundrum is why some artists and conservators have now incorporated outwitting obsolescence into their practices. Lynn Hershman Leeson, an 82-year-old artist who was a contemporary of Paik's, has been working with A.I. technology since the late 1990s and in 1983 made one of the first interactive video art pieces: "Lorna," created originally for a groundbreaking new technology called laserdisc. Twenty years later, she upgraded to another now-bygone technology -- the DVD. Lately, she's been experimenting with a futuristic method of archiving her work. Looking to preserve a series of videos and documents from her research on genetic manipulation and synthetic biology, she turned to a technology at once far older and more cutting-edge than anything else on the market: DNA. Hershman Leeson first converted her research into a video timeline on Final Cut Pro, and then enlisted Twist Bioscience in San Francisco, which manufactures DNA products, to chemically synthesize it into a sequence. The resulting genetic material is kept in two vials in her studio, as well as in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany. "DNA has a 500-year half-life," she said. "I also saw it as a metaphor, a poetic conclusion to all of this work, to create something that's relatively invisible and holds our past and our future."
The problem is, neither Hershman Leeson nor the museums that collect her work are able to retrieve it from the sequence. In theory, the process is reversible, but it's also expensive and time-consuming. At least for now, the work belongs to the future.

With a Theatrical Release, Apple Debuts Its New Film Strategy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Martin Scorsese's three-and-a-half-hour epic is the first of three high-profile movies the tech company will give wide theatrical releases in the coming months.
The box office results for Martin Scorsese's new film, "Killers of the Flower Moon," will be revealed on Sunday and analyzed by reporters and industry insiders. Did the movie perform well? Did it fall short? Did Leonardo DiCaprio's inability to promote the film because of the actors' strike ultimately mean fewer people went to see it?
This is a normal opening weekend practice for any major theatrical release, but it will be a first for Apple Studios, the producer and financier of the $ 200 million movie. It is teaming up with Paramount Pictures to release the three-and-a-half-hour R-rated film in more than 3,600 theaters.
Until now, Apple's films were streaming-first. But "Killers of the Flower Moon" won't reach its streaming service, Apple TV+, for at least 45 days. It is Apple's clearest embrace of movie theaters since the start of Apple TV+ four years ago, and the first of three major theatrical releases from the company scheduled for the next six months.
During Thanksgiving weekend, Sony Pictures will work with Apple to release Ridley Scott's "Napoleon," starring Joaquin Phoenix. In February, Apple is joining forces with Universal Pictures to release the spy caper "Argylle" in theaters around the country.
Bradley Thomas, a producer of "Killers of the Flower Moon," called Apple's partnerships "comforting," because traditional studios have decades of experience with theatrical releases.
"So Apple is dipping its toe into it," he said. "They aren't taking the whole thing on by themselves."
The producer Kevin Walsh, who began developing "Napoleon" with Apple in 2020, has watched its approach to theatrical release evolve. The turning point, he said, came after the top Apple TV+ executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amberg saw the success that Paramount had with "Top Gun," which brought in $ 1.5 billion at the global box office last year.
"What 'Top Gun' did to the box office they are trying to emulate with movies like 'Napoleon,' and 'Formula 1,"' Mr. Walsh said in an interview, referring to the upcoming Brad Pitt movie that Apple is making with the "Top Gun" director Joseph Kosinski. "I think there is money to be made, of course, for spectacle movies in the theater. But they also serve as a massive billboard for the Apple TV service when they are successful and rolled out well."
Apple's recent embrace of movie theaters is welcome news for a movie theater business that has been upended by streaming companies' penchant for making films largely for their at-home services. Netflix first disrupted the long-held tradition of the theatrical release by putting films in a limited number of theaters for a limited time -- usually the minimum required to appease filmmakers and qualify for Oscar consideration.
Amazon Studios recently reversed its approach, giving commercial films like Ben Affleck's "Air" significant time in theaters before releasing them to streaming subscribers.
But Apple, with its deep pockets, reputation for secrecy (it doesn't share streaming subscriber numbers and declined to comment for this article) and interest in controlling all components of its ecosystem, has surprised some with its willingness to team up with others to market its films to moviegoers. It's a situation that leaves the company open to the vagaries of the theatrical marketplace.
And "Killers," with its high price tag, has to do big business to become a success. Analysts are predicting that the film could fetch anywhere from $ 18 million to $ 30 million in its opening weekend. That would be a tough beginning even for a film by Mr. Scorsese, whose movies traditionally have staying power in theaters and often eventually gross close to five times what they brought in on opening weekend. The film's long run time and dark subject matter -- the plot revolves around the murders of Native Americans -- could also be commercial hurdles.
"We are a little more bullish than the industry expectations floating around," said Shawn Robbins, an independent box office analyst, who predicts the film will open in the $ 30 million range. "The film certainly has its hills to climb with a long run time and DiCaprio's absence from the press circuit."
But "strong reviews and Mr. DiCaprio's own box office history -- especially with Mr. Scorsese -- provide ample amounts of good will for audiences," he added, and work in the film's favor. "The market hasn't had a high-profile film targeted toward adults for a while." ("Oppenheimer," with a similar run time and equally serious subject matter, defied odds this year and earned $ 942 million worldwide.)
While Apple has said very little about its shift in strategy, theater owners are ecstatic.
Apple is "a major company that has the ability to do a lot of high-quality work, and I think that the recognition on their part that movies belong in theaters is a strong signal," Michael O'Leary, chairman of the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade association, said in an interview. "Prioritizing theatrical will help them get major filmmakers to come into their tents, and to create even more dynamic, entertaining fare in the years ahead."
Mr. Scorsese and his co-writer, Eric Roth, began adapting David Grann's nonfiction book "Killers of the Flower Moon" in 2017. Paramount agreed to finance and distribute the film, but when the production costs soared, the studio brought in Apple in 2020 to finance the project.
Others wanted it, said Mr. Thomas, who initially purchased the adaptation rights to "Killers" with his partner, Dan Friedkin. It was Apple, however, that guaranteed a full theatrical release -- a must for Mr. Scorsese, whose last film, "The Irishman" for Netflix, had a truncated run in theaters.
Paramount stayed on in a deal that saw Apple reimburse the studio for its development costs on the movie and a portion of Mr. Scorsese's overall deal, according to two people with knowledge of the agreement, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were not public. Paramount controls all theater bookings and media buys for the film's trailers and commercials, while Apple controls its publicity and marketing materials.
Apple made similar, though less expensive, deals with Sony Pictures for "Napoleon" and Universal Pictures for "Argyle," with Sony and Universal sharing the marketing costs with Apple and handling each film's distribution.
And while all three studios would like the opportunity to enter into long-term partnerships with Apple, the tech giant has not committed to any one partner.
"I'd be surprised if they take a single-studio approach for distribution," said Tim Bajarin, chief executive of Creative Strategies, a high-tech research firm based in Silicon Valley. "Apple is willing to work, and they have shown that they can work well, with multiple studios. I think that track is more likely to be what they'll use in the future. They are extremely calculating."

Struggling for Life On Their Own Terms: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An Iranian American woman navigates her family life and her personal life in this semi-autobiographical feature from Maryam Keshavarz.
"I dreamed of being the Iranian Martin Scorsese," confesses Leila (Layla Mohammadi), the lead character in "The Persian Version," Maryam Keshavarz's semi-autobiographical reverie about a rising Iranian American director and her tumultuous family life.
The film won the audience award at this year's Sundance Film Festival, the second of Keshavarz's movies to take that prize. (Her first, the 2011 queer romance "Circumstance," launched her career -- and got her banned from Iran.)
The movie opens at a costume party where Leila sports a niqab over a pink bikini, her cultural contradictions on brazen display. Leila, reeling from a split with her wife, Elena (Mia Foo), has a one-night stand with Maximillian (Tom Byrne) and becomes pregnant. To her conservative parents and eight brothers, Leila's impending motherhood is yet another of her outrageous scandals.
Throughout, Keshavarz wields her Scorsese influences. There are disorienting time-jumps, abrupt edits and heavy narration paired with shots of Leila strutting through New York City. But Keshavarz samples other genres, too, from westerns and twee indies to go-for-broke slapstick. Maximillian, the would-be boyfriend, stammers adorably like he's in a Hugh Grant rom-com and spends most of the film in drag. (He's playing the lead in a production of "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" at the time.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The result is a personal film that feels oddly impersonal. The tonal clutter overwhelms Keshavarz's genuinely interesting story. On the page, it might have sounded clever to have Leila hide under a gorilla mask when she bumps into her ex-wife at the grocery store. Onscreen, however, the gag feels contrived and distracting.
The script most resembles a herky-jerky one-woman show, a string of memories and cheeky, self-conscious declarations. Keshavarz has propped up her story line with refrains that don't quite coalesce. Her breakup with Elena is echoed by her description of the acrimony between Iran and America: "Like any great romance, it ended in a bitter divorce," she says, an analogy she uses twice. Her father, Ali (Bijan Daneshmand), spends the movie in a hospital awaiting a heart transplant; her mother, Shireen (Niousha Noor), is deemed "heartless."
Gradually, Keshavarz shifts her focus from Leila, essentially her fictional self, to Shireen as a way to re-examine her own mother, Azar Keshavarz, through adult eyes. The sequences that star Shireen are fantastic. The first segment, set in the early 1990s, charts her climb from uneducated immigrant housewife to real estate dynamo. The film also goes back to the late '60s when Shireen was a rural child bride. We're staggered by her journey to empowerment, a grueling stretch of which shows her desperate, alone and pregnant, riding a donkey. Kamand Shafieisabet, the phenomenal teenage actor who portrays young Shireen, continues to live in Iran. She deserves a global spotlight.
Keshavarz seems so awed by her mother's resilience that she only hesitantly sketches a through-line from that tale to her own. Instead, having shuffled through scores of ideas, Keshavarz ends the film saluting all women fighting to live on their own terms -- a struggle raging in Iran and beyond.

Comedy
NYC Sketchfest
Oct. 19-22 at the Peoples Improv Theater, 154 West 29th Street, Manhattan; thepit-nyc.com.
For its first Sketchfest since 2019, the Peoples Improv Theater is welcoming comedy troupes from around the city and across the country for a celebration and discussion of sketch comedy. The festival is back at P.I.T.'s original location in a Chelsea loft (its larger theater in the Flatiron district was shuttered in 2020 because of the pandemic).
Saturday offers the choicest lineup: At 5 p.m., The Chris & Paul Show, relatively old-school mainstays who competed on NBC's "Bring the Funny" in 2019, take the stage, with Birch & Caven opening; and at 8, there's Time to Kill, formed this summer by striking TV writers, with the Bjjörks as openers. Topping the night off at 11 are John Moreno and Jared Warner of Murderfist, a troupe that celebrated its 20th anniversary with a show last month. Moreno and Warner will put on two-handers with a musical guest, Skulk the Hulking (Steve Pasieka). On each day of the festival, from 10 a.m. to noon, people can attend writers' room drop-ins, where they can experience the collaborative process of pitching jokes and receiving feedback on scripts.
Tickets start at $ 15 per show. Four-day passes are $ 79, and one-day passes are $ 30, but the passes do not include admission to the Murderfist show, which is $ 19, or the writers' room drop-ins, which are $ 25. To purchase a ticket or pass, visit P.I.T.'s website. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Slauson Malone 1
Oct. 22 at 7 p.m. at Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Manhattan; mercuryeastpresents.com.
Followers of underground hip-hop and jazz in New York likely know Jasper Marsalis -- son of the trumpeter Wynton -- from his days in the arty, genre-bending collective Standing on the Corner. Since departing the group in 2019 and relocating to Los Angeles, Marsalis has funneled his musical output into the solo project Slauson Malone 1 (formerly just Slauson Malone) and leaned further into the experimental.
His recent work, as exemplified by his new album, "Excelsior," embraces dissonance and abstraction, with sounds and textures ranging from low-fi crooning to A.S.M.R.-style spoken word, from bassy distortion to lyrical cello. A dense and often confounding listen, the record reveals itself slowly.
Marsalis will wrap up his fall tour on Sunday at Bowery Ballroom, with opening sets by the alt-R&B singer KeiyaA and the experimental electronic artist Colloboh. Tickets are $ 25 on Ticketmaster. OLIVIA HORN
Gateways Chamber Players
Oct. 22 at 3 p.m. at Zankel Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, Manhattan; carnegiehall.org.
The Gateways Music Festival organization, which supports classical musicians of African descent, concludes its four-day event in New York with a stop at Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall's adventurous underground space. Its program pairs one of Wynton Marsalis's concert works -- "A Fiddler's Tale," released on Sony Classical in 1999 -- with its source-material inspiration: Stravinsky's "L'Histoire du Soldat."
Marsalis is a keen admirer of Stravinsky, and you can hear traces of Stravinsky's influence in Marsalis's "Meeelaan" (for bassoon and string quartet). His response to "L'Histoire du Soldat" preserves the original instrumentation -- as well as its role for a narrator. Here, the actress Phylicia Rashad will be the dramatic vocalist. And the conductor Damien Sneed, who will lead the Gateways Chamber Players through these works, is a dedicated interpreter of Marsalis's most ambitious scores.
Tickets start at $ 55 and are available at Carnegie Hall's website. SETH COLTER WALLS

Happy Howl-O-Ween! Wilderness Wolves
Oct. 22, 9:30 a.m.-noon, at the Explorers Club, 46 East 70th Street, Manhattan; gabbywild.org/events.
Fairy tales notwithstanding, humans pose far more danger to wolves than wolves pose to humans. At this program, which is part of the Animal Mystery Adventures series created by the wildlife veterinarian and conservationist Gabby Wild, children can discover the world of these magnificent creatures and solve a puzzle about their lives: Why are gray wolves having fewer pups than in the past?
Wild, who creates educational content for National Geographic Kids, will host the event, which includes a Halloween costume contest. At check-in, young explorers will receive a goody bag, an adventure packet and a pretend passport. After a continental breakfast with their accompanying adults, participants can watch a video about wolves and hear an interactive talk by Wild. Then the children can visit five activity stations, where craft and engineering projects will help the children research the issue and earn a Halloween treat. The fun concludes with an examination of the answers -- and a group howl.
Not free on Sunday? Another series program, on Nov. 19, investigates apes.
Tickets, which are limited and must be purchased online, are $ 35 for each adult-child pair and include breakfast and materials. LAUREL GRAEBER
Dance
Lyon Opera Ballet
Oct. 19-20 at 7:30 p.m. and Oct. 21 at 3 p.m. at New York City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; nycitycenter.org.
In 1979, the postmodern choreographer Lucinda Childs teamed up with the minimalist composer Philip Glass and the conceptual artist Sol LeWitt to create a thrilling study in accumulating patterns that they modestly called "Dance." Now considered a modern classic, the work for 17 dancers showcases Childs's precise yet expansive movement responding to Glass's propulsive score and layered with LeWitt's haunting black-and-white film of the dancers captured from multiple angles and at various sizes, projected onto a massive scrim. The result exudes geometric grandeur, morphing from analytic to majestic over the course of an hour.
The Lyon Opera Ballet brings "Dance" to New York City Center through Saturday with accompanying projections that were reshot in 2016 to perfectly match LeWitt's original using performers from this company. The production kicks off the citywide Dance Reflections by Van Cleef & Arpels festival, which will also include works by (La)Horde, Pina Bausch and Boris Charmatz through December.
Tickets start at $ 35 and are available at City Center's website. BRIAN SCHAEFER

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Best Buy recently said it would end DVD sales after the holiday season, and Netflix already shuttered its disc rentals. What does that mean for audiences?
If you were a child of the early 2000s, there's a good chance your Britney Spears fandom reached a fever pitch around 2002, when she was basking in the success of her third studio album, "Britney," and, months after that VMA python moment, she starred in her first feature film: "Crossroads."
The film, written by Shonda Rhimes, follows Spears's character and two friends, played by Zoe Saldaña and Taryn Manning, as they take a cross-country journey to find friendship, rock 'n' roll and a maternal relationship. There is singing on the open road. There are giggly convenience store trips. There is a boy.
I, turning 7 that year in Boise, Idaho, knew exactly what I wanted for my birthday: "Crossroads" on DVD, so I could watch it about 300 times.
Twenty years later, ahead of the release next week of Spears's memoir, "The Woman in Me," I wanted to rewatch my favorite childhood movie. But doing so turned out to be nearly impossible: "Crossroads" was not streaming on Netflix. Nor was it on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+ or any of the other streaming services I searched.
Finally, I tracked down my original "Crossroads" DVD, but was confronted with a new problem: All of the devices I had once used to watch DVDs -- computers, TVs, gaming systems -- no longer supported them. I was stuck.
Top producers such as Sony, Samsung and LG once sold tens of millions of DVD players a year. In 2009, 88 percent of American households owned a DVD player, according to Nielsen. By early 2021 that number was just 56 percent, and lower for young people.
Gaming systems used to market themselves as all-in-one entertainment hubs, where families could play games and watch movies. But by 2020, the Xbox Series S was designed for "disc-free gaming." This year, a version of the PlayStation 5 excluded the disc drive. The last Apple MacBook that contained a disc drive was released in 2012.
That mirrors a decline in the disc market, which last week was dealt another blow when Best Buy confirmed that it would stop selling DVDs and Blu-ray discs after the holiday season. Netflix shuttered its DVD delivery service at the end of September.
DVDs, which entered the market in 1996 in Japan as a more compact and durable replacement for VHS tapes, reached their peak popularity in the mid-2000s, when movie studios began to report better sales numbers in the first week of DVD release than at the box office. Domestic sales began their decline just a few years later, during the Great Recession.
"To state the obvious, the way we watch movies and TV shows is much different today than it was decades ago," a spokesman for Best Buy wrote in an email to The New York Times.
In 2021, physical media accounted for just 8 percent of the U.S. entertainment market, or $ 2.8 billion, according to the Motion Picture Association. That's a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars consumers spent on DVDs in 2005 and 2006, around the market's peak.
That DVDs have largely fallen out of use is "a function of the march of time in connection with technology," said Jason E. Squire, professor emeritus at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts and host of "The Movie Business Podcast."
"The entertainment industry is filled with these kinds of landmarks in the map of history -- radio, television, home entertainment," he said.
Even with so many streaming services out there, some movies and television series still fall through the cracks, either because the services don't think there's an audience for them, or because licensing them would be too costly.
Streaming services often buy temporary rights to a film or show, leaving some titles unavailable for gaps of time while they are without a streaming home.
For example, "Friends," which had been on Netflix for five years and was estimated to be one of its most watched shows, was unavailable on streaming for about five months in between the time that Netflix's deal ended and the show's next platform, HBO Max, got up and running.
That's why, say, if you try to continue your journey through millennial nostalgia and look for the "Spice World" movie, you'll find it's not streamable in the United States -- but it is available on DVD. Which is great news, if you still have a DVD player.
For now, there are still plenty of customers who prefer to have their favorite movies reliably available as physical objects.
"We do get customers basically every single day still buying physical media," said Diana Hernandez, the deputy store manager at the Midtown Manhattan location of Bookoff, a secondhand store that sells DVDs. Some are nostalgia buyers; others are older and more comfortable with the format; and some don't have access to the internet.
"Looking back, people in the future will be saying, 'Yeah, well, this is another typical transition for the entertainment industry because of new technology,"' Mr. Squire said.
But we're not fully there yet. For those who want a backup of their favorite series or movie, other big retailers still carry them, and the secondhand market is strong in many cities: Bookoff, for example, is expanding to Long Island soon, Ms. Hernandez said.
As for my "Crossroads" journey, I managed to play my old copy on a DVD player I borrowed from a friend. (Spoiler alert: It holds up.)
And if you want a nostalgia trip of your own but don't have time to get your hands on a DVD player, good news: The movie is back in theaters for just two days next week to celebrate the release of Spears's memoir.

Swift Film Gives Big Boost to a Strike-Slowed Industry: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The movie made an estimated $ 95 million in ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada, giving a big boost to theaters suffering from strike-related delays.
While she wasn't able to hit the astronomical heights predicted for her concert film, Taylor Swift is still the current hero of the movie business.
The world's biggest pop star has easily won the weekend box office with her concert film "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour," with an estimated three-day gross of $ 95 million to $ 97 million in North American theaters.
The PG-13-rated film, with a close to three-hour run time, has given Swifties and non-Swifties, young and old, a reason to return to the movie theaters at a time when theaters need it most. The ongoing actor's strike prompted studios to postpone six major fall releases like "Dune: Part Two" and Sony's "Ghostbusters: Afterlife" sequel, a loss that analysts predict could cost the movie business $ 1.6 billion in worldwide box office receipts.
And the box office in North America is still recovering from its prepandemic heights, down about 17 percent from 2019 when 16 more films were released in theaters.
The Taylor Swift film, which cost around $ 15 million to make, opened in 3,855 theaters in the United States and Canada. (Ms. Swift added a preview night of screenings on Thursday in 2,700 theaters to accommodate the seemingly insatiable demand for everything Taylor. Those showings grossed $ 2.8 million.)
The film earned an additional estimated $ 31 million to $ 33 million across 94 international territories in over 4,500 theaters, putting its global receipts at $ 126 million to $ 130 million. It will expand to additional international locations in the coming weeks.
Culled from the six nights she performed at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles in early August, the film features some 40 songs and covers her past 10 albums. The whole movie takes place onstage with no behind-the-scenes or backstage footage included.
Ms. Swift bypassed the traditional studio system, partnering directly with AMC Theaters to distribute the film, just nine weeks after her domestic concert tour ended. There was little traditional marketing support for the movie. Instead, Ms. Swift communicated directly with her 350 million social media followers. She will begin the international leg of her tour in February, in many of the same places where the movie is playing.
As part of the deal with AMC, Ms. Swift earns 57 percent of ticket revenue, meaning she walked away from the weekend with around $ 55 million, not including her cut from international sales. With tickets costing $ 19.89 (in homage to her birth year) for adults and $ 13.13 (her favorite number) for children ages 2 to 12 and people 60 and older, the film is still a boon for theaters, which are encouraging the celebration with relaxed cellphone policies, specially licensed popcorn tubs, friendship bracelet-making stands and even some custom drinks. A theater in Boise, Idaho, is selling Taylor Swift nonalcoholic beverages, like a maple latte titled the "All Too Well," in honor of Ms. Swift's 10-minute ballad.
"Eras Tour" is easily the biggest concert film opening ever. The previous record-holder was the Paramount Pictures' release in 2011 of "Justin Bieber: Never Say Never," which made $ 41 million over its first three days in North American theaters, adjusted for inflation, and ultimately $ 101 million in the United States and Canada and $ 138 million worldwide.
"Michael Jackson's This Is It," released by Sony Pictures in 2009, holds the record for total ticket sales. It generated $ 105 million over its entire North American run, and $ 380 million worldwide, adjusted for inflation.
Beyoncé made a similar deal with AMC, and her concert film "Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé" will open on Dec. 1.
Many in the movie industry are now wondering how long Ms. Swift, who confirmed her ubiquitous presence by making a cameo appearance on the season premiere of "Saturday Night Live," will keep her audience coming to the theaters.
"We're going to assume the box office will double from here, but there's no precedent for this; we're in uncharted territory," David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers, wrote in his recent analysis.
Adding to its unique nature, the film will only run on Thursdays through Sundays.
Elizabeth Frank, the executive vice president in charge of programming at AMC, said in a statement on Sunday that because of "tremendous recommendations and fans buying tickets to see this concert film several times," she expected the film would play "to big audiences for weeks to come."
The next big film to open is Martin Scorsese's three-hour epic "Killers of a Flower Moon," which will debut in over 3,000 theaters next weekend. Yet, the western thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone isn't likely to see its audience overlap much with "Eras," which, according to exit polls, skewed 78 percent female. The next likely blockbuster on the docket is Marvel Studios' "The Marvels" starring Brie Larson. That doesn't open until Nov. 10.

You Don't Need a Podcast to Sharpen Your Audio Projects: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The right hardware and software -- combined with time to learn -- can improve the soundtrack in your videos, podcasts and other creative endeavors.
Tired of tinny sound, echoes, inaudible dialogue or just bad audio in your home recording efforts? The popularity of social-media video and podcasts has led to a variety of affordable microphones, software and other tools for creating better-quality audio for personal projects. Even if you don't plan to start a podcast, understanding digital audio a bit more can make other tasks like recording Grandma's stories for a family-history archive or adding a narration track to your vacation videos sound much cleaner.
Here's an overview.
Hardware
Just about every laptop includes a microphone for videoconferencing and audio calls, but the fidelity can be lacking. An external microphone that plugs into your computer's USB port gives you much better sound quality. Logitech's Yeti ( $ 130) and the Shure MV5 ( $ 99) are two models recommended by Wirecutter, the product review site owned by The New York Times. (Setup is usually simple, but if you plug in the mic and nothing happens, make sure the new hardware is selected in the computer's sound input settings.)
Recording on a smartphone is standard for social-media video and audio. The phone's own headset microphone and earphones may work in some situations. If you need an external mic, say, to clip to an interview subject's shirt, you have options. RØDE makes phone-friendly external microphones, and Amazon sells a wide variety from different companies, most for less than $ 100. (Given the ever-changing ports on smartphones these days, make sure the mic you like will connect to your phone properly.)
Digital voice recorders -- with USB connectivity so you can transfer the recordings -- are another option, although the inexpensive models probably won't sound that great. Wirecutter recommends the $ 190 Sony UX560. The Zoom Corporation makes a number of hand-held recorders designed for professional use, including the $ 120 H1n-VP model.
A good pair of headphones can also come in handy during the recording and editing process, as can a quiet room free of echoes and background noise.
Software
For capturing quick recordings like spontaneous stories from toddlers, the app from your phone maker -- like Apple's Voice Memos, Google's Android Recorder and Samsung's Voice Recorder -- can work. Plenty of third-party recording apps are available as well, including the free Dolby On for Android and iOS.
Several podcasting companies have their own free or inexpensive apps for recording and editing audio, including Spotify for Podcasters (formerly the Anchor app) and Spreaker's podcast studio apps for Android and iOS. Another option, Podbean's audio recorder, has tools for recording remote guests. (And if starting a podcast intrigues you, The Times's Learning Network has a free guide to getting started.)
Riverside has tools for long-distance interviews; speakers can see each other in a video-chat window, and the software records each person directly on his or her phone or computer. The separate tracks are uploaded to a server after the session, so you don't have to worry about a slow internet connection causing glitchy audio during recording -- as can happen when directly recording audio or video conferences. Riverside ( $ 15 a month; a free trial is available) works in a browser and has its own mobile apps. Zencastr is a similar service for browsers but currently offers only an iOS app.
You can also record audio directly onto your computer. Subscription programs like Adobe Audition ( $ 21 a month) and Avid Pro Tools (starting at $ 10 a month) are designed for professionals, but if you're just starting out, free software can do the job. Audacity for Windows, Mac and Linux and Apple's GarageBand software for Mac and iOS are two options; Apple's free iMovie program can record voice-over narration for videos you have created.
Editing
When you open a sound file in an editing program, the audio data is visually displayed as a series of waveforms. Bigger, denser waves represent a lot of sound, while smaller waves or flat lines depict the quieter or silent parts of the recording. You edit the file by adjusting these waveforms.
Editing can be a complex process, but taking the time to work on your recordings allows you to whittle down a recorded conversation to just the important parts or clip out disruptions like the dog barking in the middle of your narration. Among other things, you can also adjust the volume of the speakers within the recording, add music or filter out persistent noise like the hum of an air-conditioner.
It may feel overwhelming, but you can find help and learning guides for most programs online. Audacity and GarageBand have instructions and tutorials geared toward beginners, and the latter even supplies pop-up tips to help you understand the program's controls.
Audio editing has a learning curve, but the availability of relatively inexpensive, easy-to-use hardware and software lets you dive in without breaking the bank -- and sound all the better for it.

The Rise of Tech, According to Sandra Bullock Movies: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A completely correct theory, in which one of our greatest movie stars reveals humanity's changing relationship to modernity.
At some point in the future, the sentient beings running the planet may want to study how the humans dealt with the technological revolution of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
After they have ingested the pertinent scholarly essays and news reports, they will have a pretty good idea of how we managed the shift to a world increasingly driven by machines. And that might be enough.
But why stop at enough when they might deepen their understanding by looking into something that might seem irrelevant at first glance: the films of Sandra Bullock, one of the biggest stars of the transitional period.
Ms. Bullock had the good or bad fortune to have been born in 1964, meaning she was young enough to adapt to tech culture when it came along but old enough to mourn the passing of the environment that had shaped her.
Her movies are time capsules that preserve the look and feel of discrete moments in tech, some of them all but forgotten. When you find yourself watching the 2002 romantic comedy "Two Weeks Notice" on this or that streaming platform, you can't help but fixate on the clamshell phone that Hugh Grant uses to call Ms. Bullock from a bar at 2:15 a.m.
Or maybe you're caught up in "The Proposal," a 2009 comedy in which she plays a New York publishing boss, and you're momentarily thrown from the story when our heroine, far from home and without a laptop, steps into an internet cafe to send an email. You pause to consider the fate of those little establishments, which once seemed to be everywhere and are now ... gone?
Team Analog
Ms. Bullock became a star thanks to her knack for playing a quirky Everywoman whose secret strength comes to the fore when she is put to the test. You underestimate a Sandra Bullock character at your peril. Like Jimmy Stewart for earlier generations of moviegoers, she is a gloriously imperfect stand-in for you and me.
All kinds of social issues crop up in her movies, but a consistent through line is how we have grappled, often fumblingly, with technological change. Ms. Bullock's onscreen relationship to tech is thus quite unlike that of a fellow box-office champ from the same period, Tom Cruise, whose more obviously heroic characters demonstrate a slick command of advanced gadgetry in the "Top Gun" and "Mission: Impossible" blockbusters.
Ms. Bullock made her breakthrough in "Speed," playing an office worker, Annie Porter, who ends up behind the wheel of a Los Angeles city bus that is rigged to blow up if its speed dips below 50 miles per hour. The movie was a hit thanks to its catchy premise and the felicitous pairing of Ms. Bullock and Keanu Reeves, who plays a serene bomb-disposal officer, Jack Traven.
The crashes, explosions and flirtatious repartee camouflage the fact that "Speed" is, at its heart, an analog-versus-digital fable. Along the course of an action-packed morning, Annie and Jack make use of soon-to-be-outdated technological tools to vanquish a madman who relies on state-of-the-art gizmos.
In 1994, when "Speed" was a summertime blockbuster, roughly 31 percent of households in the United States had a computer, and a majority of people who gained access to the internet paid dearly for each online minute as their modems hissed.
This was the toddlerhood of digital tech, when many Americans seemed put off by the World Wide Web's rambunctious arrival on the scene. "What is internet, anyway?" the "Today" show co-anchor Bryant Gumbel asked in an exasperated tone during a 1994 broadcast segment that has since gone viral.
When the villain of "Speed," played by Dennis Hopper, lays out his plan, he does so while speaking on a cellphone. His lair includes several televisions, as well as an internet-enabled computer allowing him to track the bus's location and speed. One of his TVs displays a live security-camera feed of Annie, Jack and the passengers.
To show he means business, the Hopper character kills a hostage by detonating an explosive device via remote control from his apartment. Seconds later, his eyes glued to a TV news report of the fatality, he delivers a line suggesting that, in the world of "Speed," evil and tech innovations go hand in hand: "Interactive TV, Jack! Wave of the future!"
But he has a weakness that can be exploited by those skilled in the old ways. The police cobble together a 60-second video of the security-cam footage and play it on a loop as Annie and Jack help carry out a high-speed evacuation of the bus. When the villain realizes he has been duped by mere VHS trickery, he lets out a howl. Human ingenuity, aided by good old analog tech, has saved the day.
Ms. Bullock's next action movie, "The Net," released in 1995, had a prescient focus on identity theft and the overreach of Silicon Valley, subject matter that made an impression on audiences and critics of the time. "Do You Exist if the Internet Erases You?" The New York Times asked in the review's headline.
At the film's start, Ms. Bullock's character, a computer programmer, is at ease with the new tech and its attendant culture. She works from home, making her perhaps the first film protagonist to be a remote employee in the current sense of the term. She has online buddies, like Cyberbob and Iceman, and she's skilled enough in the ways of the internet to pull off something that seemed novel at the time: ordering a pizza online. The camera lingers on the process, lending the scene the feel of an instructional film.
The rest adds up to a cautionary tale. In "The Net," even the web's natives suspect that their way of life may lead to a fraying of the ties that bind the human community. "No one leaves the house anymore," Iceman says in an online chat. "No one has sex. The Net is ultimate condom." Ms. Bullock's character replies: "Talk like that, Iceman, could lead to the eventual extinction of our species."
She soon stumbles onto a software virus hatched by a ruthless tech company. When she starts investigating, all records of her identity are deleted, and she is listed in government databases as a terrorist.
She realizes her online skills will not help her overcome the villain, a stylish tech bro. Her only recourse is to go full analog: In the climactic sequence, she bonks him on his genius head, twice, with a fire extinguisher. As in "Speed," the old order, with Ms. Bullock as its champion, is restored -- and our high-tech future is put off for another day.
Enter the Multitasker
In the mid-'90s, most people could get through the day just fine without a lot of personal tech. So audiences didn't particularly notice that cellphones and laptops had no role in Ms. Bullock's other film of 1995, "While You Were Sleeping."
The heroine, a humble token-booth employee who lives with her cat, has a crush on one of her regular customers, a handsome businessman played by Peter Gallagher. When he is shoved onto the train tracks, she saves his life. At the hospital, where he spends days in an attractive coma, she allows the staff to believe she is his fiancée. The film becomes a love-triangle comedy with the arrival of the patient's brother, a carpenter played by Bill Pullman.
To learn about the hunky coma patient, Ms. Bullock's character goes through his personal effects. She finds a wallet that includes photographs of himself (conceited much?) and a proximity key fob for a BMW, a gadget that was starting to become standard issue for luxury cars in the '90s. It is the only significant tech device in this throwback tale and helps form a portrait of her crush as a shallow guy.
The Pullman character, by contrast, wears flannel shirts and drives an old pickup. He is also is onto her ruse. In a parking garage, she's holding the fob when he zings her with questions to test her knowledge of his brother and suggests that she has no idea where the BMW is parked. He's right about that -- but when she presses a button, a nearby car chirps, allowing her to continue her playacting and postpone the moment when she and the salt-of-the-earth carpenter can acknowledge their love for each other.
In the next decade, tech devices became an almost unnoticed part of the cinematic furniture, and the onscreen Ms. Bullock allows them into her life with mixed results. In "28 Days," a 2000 film about an alcoholic, her character is headed for rock bottom when she commandeers a limo while drunk. Holding a Sony cellphone to her ear, she narrowly avoids several collisions before plowing into a house. At the time of filming, Westchester County, where the scene takes place, was considering a law banning the use of hand-held cellphones on the road.
The 2000 blockbuster "Miss Congeniality" stars Ms. Bullock as Gracie Hart, a shoot-first-ask-questions-later F.B.I. agent who goes undercover at a beauty pageant. At the time of its release, just over 50 percent of American adults used the internet, according to Pew Research Center, and the fledgling web is integral to the film's plot.
In an early scene, Agent Hart's colleagues are trying to find "a female F.B.I. agent under age 35," as one character puts it, who can pose as a pageant contestant. Sitting near a row of bulky computers, this group of mostly male agents, along with our gum-chewing heroine, visits a website, Dress Up Sally, that offers simulations of what various people would look like in swimsuits and gowns. The cut-and-paste images on the screen are a long way from today's deepfakes, but enough to excite the men in the room.
As various women are put through the internet wringer, the group grows raucous. Agent Hart looks on, blank-faced. In "Miss Congeniality," the web is not so much a game-changing technology as it is the plaything of adolescent-minded men in positions of authority. The scene makes plain that Agent Hart faces a twofold challenge: In addition to nailing the culprit, she must navigate a world steeped in sexism, one that the internet seems likely to exacerbate.
By the time of the 2005 sequel, "Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous," the web has become more useful to her, as it had to the 36 million Americans who were using computers to download movies and songs. Agent Hart is now the owner of a pearly white iBook G4 laptop, a machine considerably thicker than the MacBooks of today. It was part of a line that Apple put out from 2003 to 2005, when its products had become status symbols.
In this time of tech optimism, a visit to a bright, clean Apple store was a trip to retail heaven, rather than a loathsome errand. "Miss Congeniality 2" matches the moment in having Agent Hart solve the case by using her iBook to analyze footage that shows the kidnappers snatching the victims from a sidewalk.
The scene of her watching the video while lounging in bed also provides a rose-hued illustration of the enmeshment of digital devices with our private lives.
But tech's tendency to worm its way into intimate moments is not always such a wonderful thing. In the 2009 comedy "All About Steve," Ms. Bullock plays a socially awkward person who relies on pen and paper in her job as crossword puzzle maker for The Sacramento Herald. When she goes on a blind date with a cable news cameraman played by Bradley Cooper, it is love at first sight, at least from her perspective.
She lunges at him moments after laying eyes on him, announcing, "I am going to eat you like a mountain lion!" That's when tech enters the story, to her detriment, in the form of a vibrating cellphone. The man takes a slim device from his pocket before telling her he must go, because of a breaking news story.
In "The Blind Side," the 2009 film that gave Ms. Bullock her best actress Oscar, she plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a no-nonsense interior decorator, businesswoman and mother in Memphis, Tenn., who takes into her home a Black teenager who has survived poverty and abuse and helps guide him to a college football scholarship.
Tech is prominent in Ms. Tuohy's grand entrance. The camera tracks her as she strides through a crowd on the way to her daughter's volleyball game while conducting a work call on her cell. The image she projects, with the help of the prop at her ear, is that of the 21st-century multitasker, someone who is physically present but mentally elsewhere, someone who is too big for the room.
Back to Nature
Ms. Bullock battled most valiantly against technology in "Gravity," a 2013 film about a space shuttle mission gone wrong. She plays Ryan Stone, a biomedical engineer on her first trip beyond the stratosphere. Her job is to equip the Hubble Space Telescope with an X-ray imaging device of her own design.
She is experiencing severe motion sickness as she tries to perform her task. Disaster strikes when explosions rumbles through the satellite belt. Shortly before the fast-moving debris destroys the shuttle, the lead astronaut, a cheerful sort played by George Clooney, takes a moment to gaze upon Earth. "Half of North America just lost their Facebook," he says.
He dies soon afterward, leaving Dr. Stone alone in the vastness of space. She must summon the will to go on while figuring out how to fly two small spacecrafts. If she cannot master the tech, she will die.
Her prospects seem dim as she struggles to make sense of a jargon-heavy manual. She hits a low point when the second spacecraft runs out of fuel. She shuts all systems down and gives up.
In the profound silence, she realizes she might be able to use the landing thrusters to propel herself toward Earth's atmosphere. She decides to give it a try but has no idea which button to push. "Eenie, meenie, minie, moe," she says, before landing on her choice.
After she crash-lands in a lake, the film ends with what will become something of a trope in Sandra Bullock movies: a shot of her in a lush natural setting. Filmed from below in the final moment of "Gravity," she looks powerful, like a new Eve, as she walks into the green surroundings.
In "Bird Box," a 2018 film about an unexplained apocalyptic event and its aftermath, countless people commit suicide when they see something in front of them. An early victim is a young woman who is shown talking on a smartphone; the next time we see her, she is bashing her head into a glass wall. Did her death have something to do with the smartphone? An evil meme, perhaps? That would make sense for a film that came out when techno-optimism had soured amid the rise of bot farms, spyware and the social-media-assisted spread of conspiracy theories.
The "Bird Box" protagonist forms a bond with survivors who have holed up in a house. Digital tech becomes crucial to them when they take a car to the supermarket: Because they cannot look at the outside world, they black out the windows and rely on GPS to navigate the corpse-ridden streets. Later, Ms. Bullock squires her two children through wild terrain unaided by any device. She finds her reward in an idyllic settlement deep in a forest. She has moved from the tech-strewn 21st century to a setting reminiscent of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
"The Lost City" follows a similar arc. In this 2022 action-adventure comedy, Ms. Bullock plays a widowed romance novelist who has the mind-set of an academic. Attempting a comeback after years away from the scene, she finds that the publishing industry has changed in her absence, thanks to the rise of social media. Image now trumps content, and her fans are more interested in the model who poses for her book covers, played by Channing Tatum, than the author herself.
She is less than pleased when her editor introduces her to an extremely online young woman who will be her social media manager. "She's going to be helping us target that younger demographic," the editor says, "meaning women in their 30s who wish they were in their 20s." Cue Bullock eye roll.
She is soon kidnapped and whisked to a remote island. And so a film that begins in the world of smartphones and social media ends up in a place that smacks of the jungle serials popular nearly a century ago. In the 2020s, this counts as an attractive fantasy.
With tech no longer seen as a part of the solution, "The Lost City" concludes with Ms. Bullock and Mr. Tatum on a tropical beach. They are locked in a kiss, as far as you can get from the digital life.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: They could save money if Activision's titles are added to Xbox Game Pass, a monthly subscription service. But some are reserving judgment.
When Microsoft announced that it was spending $ 69 billion to buy the video game maker Activision Blizzard in January last year, Justin Kats was stunned.
To Mr. Kats, a 34-year-old former professional video game player from Lansing, Ill., it was a seismic event that allowed Microsoft to claim victory over Sony in the console business by obtaining Activision's slate of popular games, like Call of Duty.
"I thought there was no way -- this can't be," he said. "Console wars are over? Xbox wins?" Mr. Kats, who now streams video games recreationally on Twitch under the name FearItSelf for Evil Geniuses, a professional gaming organization, worried that Microsoft, which makes the Xbox, would take Call of Duty away from people who played on Sony's PlayStation consoles.
But over the past year, Mr. Kats has been heartened by Microsoft's plans to keep Call of Duty available on PlayStation, and by its agreements to offer the game to Nintendo's Switch and other platforms. With the deal finally closing Friday after a global regulatory battle, Mr. Kats, like many other gamers, is now cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's assuming control of one of the gaming industry's biggest publishers.
"There's a lot of energy and hype and attention," Mr. Kats said, "but with that comes skepticism, and expectations are a lot higher because you spent all this money."
The process of securing regulatory approvals for a corporate merger is often a dull slog, watched only by the keenest business and antitrust enthusiasts. Not so with Microsoft's Activision deal, which has captured the attention of millions of video game enthusiasts.
Gamers inundated a British regulatory agency with more than 2,000 public comments, spent countless hours on YouTube watching legal analysis of government attempts to block the deal and packed the Zoom audience for a hearing in federal court about the acquisition in June.
Three-quarters of those who emailed the British agency said they were eager to see Microsoft complete its deal. Many were convinced that the transaction would buoy Activision's game development and give players access to premium games for a cheaper price through Microsoft's monthly subscription.
Gamers have also expressed hope that Activision, which was accused in a 2021 lawsuit of having a sexist workplace culture, will improve its treatment of employees under Microsoft's ownership. Some PlayStation gamers who fear their platform's quality will now lag behind Xbox's, however, remain worried.
The acquisition was one of the most dramatic developments in the history of the video game console wars, a long-running feud between PlayStation and Xbox players that is akin to interactions between fans of rival sports teams.
Gamers are notoriously opinionated, and they have weighed in on aspects of the deal ranging from the future of Bobby Kotick, Activision's chief executive, to the Federal Trade Commission's struggles to understand the gaming industry as it took Microsoft to court in an attempt to block the transaction.
Gamers' interest in the transaction has been so strong that it repeatedly came up in federal court. A Microsoft lawyer, Beth Wilkinson, suggested that the company could not afford the reputational blow if it reneged on promises to keep Call of Duty available on PlayStation.
"They couldn't face the wrath from the gamers," she testified.
In recent years, Microsoft has tried to improve its image with gamers, positioning itself as unconcerned about competing with Sony and more focused on removing barriers to playing games by offering low-cost products like Xbox Game Pass, the $ 11-a-month subscription.
It has said its acquisition of Activision is good for the industry, though government regulators like the F.T.C. argued that the purchase was anticompetitive, and some of Microsoft's private communications that were revealed in court showed the tech giant was more interested in battling Sony by keeping games exclusive to its Xbox ecosystem than it had let on.
On Friday, Microsoft said the deal's closure would instead increase access to Activision's games.
"We believe our news today will unlock a world of possibilities for more ways to play," Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, wrote in a blog post.
Many gamers trust that Microsoft will keep its word, and think the deal will be good for the industry. Ross Varner, an information technology consultant in Houston, said he and other gamers he knew thought Microsoft was likely to improve Activision's corporate culture while also giving the developer the freedom and time needed to produce quality games.
"Because Activision has basically just been a Call of Duty machine for the last several years, they're hopeful that Microsoft will have them go back to franchises they haven't touched in a long time," said Mr. Varner, 35, who plays on both an Xbox and a PlayStation.
Sony, which declined to comment on the deal's closure, had opposed the Activision deal, concerned that Microsoft could remove Call of Duty from PlayStation or otherwise degrade the game on its platforms, even though Microsoft has said it will not. After the F.T.C.'s efforts to stop the deal fizzled out in July, Sony agreed to a 10-year contract with Microsoft to keep the game on PlayStation. But PlayStation loyalists are still nervous.
"It's making me feel like I need to switch to a whole different ecosystem in order to play the games that I was already playing," said Johnathan Schoepf, a human resources specialist in Cincinnati who is primarily a PlayStation gamer.
Mr. Schoepf, 25, said he expected that future Activision games would be exclusive to Xbox, just as new games from Bethesda -- a developer that Microsoft acquired in 2020 -- have been.
"It's a little bit like we've been stabbed in the back," he said. "Microsoft has come and consolidated a huge part of the industry, two of the major publishing studios, and now is restricting their output on rival consoles."
Mr. Kats, the former professional gamer, said he was optimistic, but was reserving judgment until he saw exactly how Microsoft handled the development of future iterations of key franchises like Call of Duty.
"The grass isn't always greener just because another tech giant has taken over the reins," he said.

How Microsoft Turned the Tide in Its Regulatory Fight Over Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company found a way to placate three of the most powerful regulatory bodies in the world, along with a federal judge in San Francisco.
The first call that Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, made in early 2022 after his company announced a $ 69 billion deal to buy the video game publisher Activision Blizzard was to Kenichiro Yoshida, the chief executive of Sony.
Activision made the blockbuster video game Call of Duty, and Sony made the PlayStation game console, which competed with Microsoft's Xbox. Mr. Nadella knew Sony would be worried that Microsoft might yank Activision's games from PlayStation.
"I just wanted to make it very, very clear to Yoshida-san, who's someone I have a fantastic relationship with, that there should be no ambiguity in our support for the Sony platform going forward," Mr. Nadella would later testify in court.
The call was a linchpin of Microsoft's legal strategy to overcome immense government scrutiny of the largest consumer tech deal in decades. To complete the deal, Microsoft needed to mollify three of the most powerful and skeptical regulators in the world: the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the European Commission in Brussels and Britain's Competition and Markets Authority.
Microsoft slowly flipped competitors into allies, signing private deals to pre-empt concerns that it anticipated from regulators. When diplomacy didn't work, it made a substantial concession and used expansive legal resources to grind the government agencies down.
The strategy worked. European regulators turned the private arrangements with rivals into a formal settlement. A judge in the United States repeatedly cited those side deals to let the acquisition proceed over the F.T.C.'s objections. And after initially opposing the deal, the British regulator reopened talks with Microsoft after the company made concessions to limit its control over game streaming, getting formal approval on Friday. That same day -- almost 21 months after it was initially announced to the public -- Microsoft closed the deal.
A Microsoft executive said the closing of the deal signaled a "good day to play" and Activision's chief executive called it a "milestone" for the company. A spokeswoman for the Federal Trade Commission, Victoria Graham, said the agency would continue with its challenge to the deal even though it has closed. Sony declined to comment.
Microsoft leaned on an expansive lobbying and legal operation developed after its yearslong antitrust battle in the 1990s. Under Brad Smith, the company's president and de facto head of government relations, Microsoft has built deep relationships in Washington and painted itself as a responsible corporate citizen that has shed its bellicose reputation.
It has not gone perfectly to plan. Microsoft's charm offensive failed to sway Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, who has led the commission to take a more muscular stance toward the power of tech's biggest companies. The agency challenged the deal in administrative court and then asked a federal court to stop its closing, but ultimately failed. The F.T.C. has appealed the federal court's ruling.
Several senators also asked the F.T.C. to examine the acquisition's impact on workers, a topic that Ms. Khan had taken interest in. Microsoft brokered an agreement to remain neutral in a unionization campaign by the Communications Workers of America, which initially opposed the deal.
The labor union began advocating on Microsoft's behalf, directly appealing to Ms. Khan, but her focus on consumer issues prevailed. The neutrality deal remains, even though the political benefit fizzled.
And for more than half a year, Microsoft tried to woo Sony, with talks running off and on until late August, when the head of Microsoft's gaming division, Phil Spencer, emailed a Sony executive, Jim Ryan, with a list of games that Microsoft would guarantee could remain on PlayStation.
"It was not a meaningful list," Mr. Ryan later testified, explaining that "for example, Overwatch is on there, but Overwatch 2 is not on there, the current version of the game."
Just as regulators were moving into more intense phases of review, any hope of an alliance with Sony petered out. So Microsoft turned to the other big console maker, Nintendo, whose immensely popular Switch device competes with Xbox and PlayStation.
Sarah Bond, an Xbox executive, testified that she had initially emailed the president of Nintendo's North American division, Doug Bowser, hours after the deal was announced. But it was only in December that Microsoft announced an agreement to offer Call of Duty to Nintendo's Switch. The F.T.C. wasn't swayed, and soon sued to block the deal in its administrative court.
The F.T.C.'s suit pushed Microsoft to sign contracts that cemented its informal promises to rivals, Ms. Bond testified. "We wanted to make it absolutely clear that we would do it, and we wanted to make a legally binding commitment to demonstrate that," she said.
Microsoft announced several of those deals with game streaming partners at a news conference in Brussels. In May, the European Union blessed the acquisition, on the condition that Microsoft keep up those streaming agreements. But the British regulator still moved to block the deal in late April, saying it was worried that Microsoft would dominate the nascent game streaming industry. To many, it looked like the deal could collapse.
Microsoft turned to an increasingly popular tactic for corporate lawyers trying to defeat regulators. While trying to get mergers approved, companies frequently promise regulators that they won't engage in certain anticompetitive behavior, or they offer to spin off part of their operations. Regulators are increasingly rejecting those promises as inadequate and challenging mergers in court instead.
But companies have found success in defeating those court challenges by, effectively, getting a judge to agree that their promises to regulators should have been enough. In antitrust circles, the tactic is known as "litigating the fix." Microsoft had its fix: the contracts it had reached with its rivals promising access to Call of Duty.
But it needed to get in front of a judge.
The F.T.C.'s suit in its internal court had been scheduled for trial on Aug. 8. But Microsoft was confident it could win if it made its case directly to a federal judge -- something that would put pressure on the F.T.C. to drop its entire challenge before the deadline to close the deal by mid-July.
In early June, the F.T.C. emailed Microsoft, asking if the company would commit to not closing the deal until it resolved the issues in Britain, according to a person familiar with the correspondence. Microsoft said it couldn't promise that. Quickly, the F.T.C. sued Microsoft in federal court, saying an order from the court to stop the deal from closing was "necessary because Microsoft and Activision have represented that they may consummate the proposed acquisition at any time."
Ten days later, Microsoft had the federal trial it wanted.
The F.T.C. argued during a federal hearing in June that the agreements Microsoft had signed were confusing and rushed, and that the judge should not factor them into her consideration.
But Microsoft's gamble worked.
The judge, Jacqueline Scott Corley, ruled in Microsoft's favor, saying she was persuaded in part by the company's offer of Call of Duty to other platforms. In her decision, she wrote that Microsoft "will probably not have an incentive to breach these agreements."
Judge Corley also noted that Microsoft's strategy had resulted in concessions that would benefit consumers.
"That scrutiny has paid off: Microsoft has committed in writing, in public and in court to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox," Judge Corley wrote. "It made an agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Switch. And it entered several agreements to for the first time bring Activision's content to several cloud gaming services."
In a rare move, the British regulator then said it was reconsidering its opposition because Microsoft seemed willing to make new concessions. Microsoft formally submitted a new plan: It would transfer the streaming rights to license all current and future Activision games to Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher.
The arrangement, which would last for 15 years everywhere outside of the European Union, means Microsoft would not have the power to unilaterally make Activision's games available exclusively on its own streaming service.
Almost two months after reviewing the revised plan, the British regulator gave Microsoft its final blessing. The company closed the deal hours later.

Microsoft Gets Merger at Last With Activision: [National Desk]

Full text: The megadeal could strengthen Microsoft's standing in the video game industry, after a year and a half of negotiations with regulators around the world.
Microsoft said on Friday that it had closed its $ 69 billion purchase of the video game giant Activision Blizzard, overcoming significant regulatory hurdles in Britain and the United States and signaling that the tech industry's giants are still free to use their cash hoards to get even bigger.
The deal, the largest consumer tech acquisition since AOL bought Time Warner more than two decades ago, won approval from British regulators on Friday, the last remaining regulatory obstacle.
The completion of Microsoft's Activision acquisition is a clear signal that several years of governments around the world scrutinizing big tech companies have so far done little to curb their power, their growth or their ability to ink megadeals. And the deal could provide a blueprint for other big tech companies on how to successfully fend off the intervention of regulators.
Microsoft overcame roadblocks in multiple countries from government officials who said the merger would dampen competition in the video game industry.
Their challenges were part of a larger effort by governments around the world to take action against tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon and Meta, which owns Facebook. The Federal Trade Commission tried to stop Meta from buying a start-up that makes a virtual reality fitness game. The Justice Department last year sued to stop a deal for a health tech company that it said would give one of the nation's largest insurers data about its competitors.
But both of those challenges were unsuccessful. Although regulators have succeeded in blocking or forcing companies to abandon some deals -- including in publishing, aerospace and semiconductor manufacturing -- they have yet to score a major victory against one of the giant digital platforms that dominate online commerce.
Regulators are nonetheless pushing ahead with cases against tech companies. The Justice Department is in the middle of a trial against Google, arguing that the company abused its power as a monopoly over online search. The F.T.C. is pursuing a monopoly lawsuit of its own against Meta, arguing that the company used the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp to stamp out future competitors. In September, it sued Amazon, saying the company had hindered competition when it squeezed merchants and favored its own services.
Microsoft navigated a tricky process for its megadeal that included securing approval from dozens of countries. It agreed to offer continued access to one of Activision's flagship franchises, Call of Duty, on game platforms from other companies like Nintendo and Sony.
In April, Britain's regulatory agency, the Competition and Markets Authority, dealt the deal a significant blow by blocking its approval in Britain. But the regulator reversed its decision after Microsoft agreed to license to a rival a part of Activision's business associated with so-called cloud gaming, a small but promising new area for the industry.
The F.T.C. unsuccessfully sought a preliminary injunction against Microsoft in the United States, which would have delayed the deal's closing and potentially doomed it to a drawn-out legal appeals process. The agency has appealed that ruling, but the deal was able to close while that legal process plays out.
Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, celebrated the deal's closure in a blog post Friday, nodding to the concerns from rivals and regulators about players without an Xbox losing access to Activision's games.
"Whether you play on Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC or mobile, you are welcome here -- and will remain welcome, even if Xbox isn't where you play your favorite franchise," he wrote.
Microsoft has not fully satisfied regulators, and it is taking a calculated risk that it will not be forced to unwind the acquisition years down the line. An F.T.C. case against the combination is still pending in its administrative court, in a process that can take years to resolve.
If the F.T.C. prevails there, Microsoft can eventually appeal to almost any federal court of its choosing. That means it could take the case to the same court that already ruled in its favor in denying the F.TC. its preliminary injunction.
Victoria Graham, a spokeswoman for the F.T.C., said the agency was focused on appealing the judge's order declining to block the deal from closing in the United States.
"The F.T.C. continues to believe this deal is a threat to competition," she said in a statement.
Microsoft convinced a federal judge in July that the F.T.C.'s arguments about the merger harming competition were not strong enough to stop the deal from closing. The company then announced in August that it had struck a deal aimed at addressing the concerns of the C.M.A., the British regulator. Microsoft said it would give Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher, the rights to license all current and future Activision games for distribution on streaming platforms, meaning games played by harnessing the power of the cloud.
The C.M.A. had worried that Microsoft's exclusive control of the popular Activision games would help it attain a monopoly in the nascent cloud gaming industry, but the Ubisoft deal alleviated its concerns.
For Microsoft, closing the deal is "a win for their Xbox strategy," said Joost van Dreunen, a video game analyst who teaches at New York University. "It's also, perhaps more importantly, a win for Microsoft as a company" because it culminates a yearslong effort to improve its relationship among regulators and in Washington, he said.
When it announced the acquisition in January 2022, Microsoft committed to closing the deal by mid-July of this year or paying Activision a $ 3 billion breakup fee. Ultimately, it needed a little more time, and the two companies agreed to extend the deadline to mid-October.
Now, the merger has the potential to reshape competition in the video game industry. Microsoft has long been criticized for lagging behind competitors like Sony and Nintendo in its quality of games, and it has lacked a substantial presence in the fast-growing mobile-gaming sector.
Activision's King division, which produces the mobile game Candy Crush, will give Microsoft a significant boost in that area. Call of Duty games alone have generated more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue. And Activision's portfolio of other popular titles, like Diablo and World of Warcraft, could make its game subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, even more enticing.
Activision had not allowed those marquee titles on a subscription platform, betting that it could make more money by selling them individually. But Microsoft has indicated that it will have no such qualms, because the future of its gaming ambitions rests on its Netflix-style Game Pass offering, which has more than 25 million subscribers who pay about $ 10 a month for access to a catalog of games.
"At 25 million subscribers, they're losing money, but at 100 million, they're probably making money; at 200 million, they're making a lot of money," said Michael Pachter, a tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. "They know they'll never get from 25 to 50 without a game like Call of Duty."
Activision said this month that it expected its games would begin showing up on Game Pass sometime next year. Aside from offering Activision's games on Game Pass, Microsoft has indicated it plans to allow Activision to continue operating as an independent studio. Still, being under Microsoft's umbrella could be a win for both shareholders and the company's employees, analysts said.
When the proposed merger was announced, Activision was undergoing a cultural upheaval after a California lawsuit accused the company of fostering a sexist workplace environment in which women were routinely harassed. Its chief executive, Bobby Kotick, faced calls to resign. Now, he could exit the company, earning more than $ 400 million for completing the merger.
Activision has said it has worked to improve its culture, strengthened anti-harassment policies and released a transparency report this year that detailed actions it has taken and said there had "never been widespread or systemic harassment."
In a note to employees on Friday, Mr. Kotick wrote that "combining with Microsoft will bring new resources and new opportunities to our extraordinary teams worldwide." He said he would stay at Activision through the end of the year, reporting to Mr. Spencer.
Mr. Spencer, in his blog post, wrote that Microsoft's gaming division had "a culture that strives to empower everyone to do their best work, where all people are welcome."
As part of an agreement with the Communications Workers of America union last year, Microsoft also pledged to remain neutral toward any Activision employees' efforts to unionize, a push that began last year.
"The win for people not in the C-suite," Mr. van Dreunen said, "is they will now be working for an employer that maintains perhaps higher standards in its relationship with its employees."

Full text: The pop star's concert film, arriving in theaters on Friday, is expected to break box office records. "The fever and scale is unprecedented," one analyst said.
The world's biggest pop star, Taylor Swift, is about to become the world's biggest movie star, at least for a weekend. The only question is whether turnout for her concert film will be enormous or truly colossal.
Box office analysts keep raising opening-weekend estimates for "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour," which will arrive in cinemas on Friday evening amid a lightning storm of free publicity. (As you may have heard, Ms. Swift has lately been spending considerable time with Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end.) The nearly three-hour film was initially expected to sell about $ 75 million in tickets this weekend in the United States and Canada, with analysts reaching that estimate by studying presales and moviegoer surveys. As of Tuesday, the domestic number was looking more like $ 125 million.
Could it reach $ 150 million? "Yes, it could," said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. "The fever and scale is unprecedented."
"The Eras Tour," which cost Ms. Swift roughly $ 15 million to make, is expected to collect an additional $ 60 million overseas -- at a minimum -- over the weekend.
"We are wonder-struck," said Wanda Gierhart Fearing, chief marketing and content officer for the Cinemark theater chain, which has a large presence in the southern United States and Latin America. In addition to standard screenings, Cinemark and other multiplex operators have been offering private viewing parties. (That's $ 800 for 40 people. Dancing encouraged, but not on seats.)
The domestic box office record for a concert film debut is held by "Justin Bieber: Never Say Never," which Paramount Pictures released in 2011. It collected $ 41 million over its first three days in North American theaters, adjusted for inflation, and ultimately $ 101 million in the United States and Canada and $ 138 million worldwide.
"Michael Jackson's This Is It," released by Sony Pictures in 2009, holds the record for total ticket sales. It generated $ 105 million over its entire North American run, and $ 380 million worldwide, adjusted for inflation.
Box office analysts aren't quite sure what to expect from "The Eras Tour," in part because it comes only nine weeks after Ms. Swift concluded the six-month, 53-show initial leg of her sold-out North American tour. The trade publication Pollstar estimated that she had sold about $ 14 million in tickets each night.
Has the thirst for Ms. Swift among casual fans been satisfied for the time being? To what degree did the cultural frenzy surrounding her Eras concerts pique the curiosity of a broader audience -- people who would never pay hundreds of dollars to see her perform in a stadium but might shell out for movie tickets? (Most seats for the film cost $ 19.89, a nod to the name of Ms. Swift's fifth album and her birth year.)
Complicating predictions, Ms. Swift broke Hollywood norms in getting her film to theaters.
Under the customary model, studios book movies into theaters and spend anywhere from $ 20 million to $ 100 million on marketing to turn out an audience. Theaters play movies and sell concessions. In return, studios collect as much as 70 percent of opening-weekend tickets sales, with theaters keeping the balance.
Since she produced and financed "The Eras Tour" herself, Ms. Swift cut out the middle company (a studio) and made a distribution deal directly with AMC Entertainment, the world's largest theater operator. One reason involved marketing: Ms. Swift, with 369 million social media followers at her beck and call, barely needs to spend anything to advertise the film.
Ms. Swift will keep about 57 percent of ticket revenue, with theater chains pocketing the rest, as first reported by a Puck newsletter. AMC will also receive a modest distribution fee.
Box office forecasting, however, is based on moviegoer surveys that are designed to track the effectiveness of studio marketing campaigns -- older women are not being persuaded by your ads, for example, but teenage boys are in the bag. "The Eras Tour" has had some paid advertising, including a commercial during a Chiefs prime-time game this month. But most movies arrive amid an advertising bombardment.
"One of the questions involves staying power," said Bruce Nash, founder of the Numbers, a box office tracking and analytics site. "Is 'The Eras Tour' going to do most of its business on opening weekend and then fall off a cliff? Or will people come back six times over the course of weeks? We have no idea."
Ms. Swift's distribution choice made Hollywood gnash its teeth. Studio executives had to explain to their bosses why they missed a prime moneymaking opportunity and a chance to form a relationship with Ms. Swift, who has feature film directing ambitions. (She has also tinkered with acting, including in "Cats.") Universal Pictures, fearing competition from "The Eras Tour," scrambled to move "The Exorcist: Believer" to an earlier date; ticket sales were soft.
Studios have also had to contend with an existential question: Does distribution for "The Eras Tour" mark the start of a paradigm shift? Are more movies going to bypass studios? Already, Beyoncé has followed Ms. Swift in making a deal with AMC to distribute her concert documentary, "Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé," which will arrive in theaters on Dec. 1.
Anything is possible. Mr. Nash noted that Fathom Events, an independent distributor that specializes in short-run screenings and simulcast opera performances, has found increasing success in taking faith-based projects ("The Chosen") directly to theaters. Trafalgar Releasing found a studio-skipping hit in February with a concert film focused on BTS, the South Korean boy band.
But most studio executives and entertainment industry analysts dismiss "The Eras Tour" as a one-off. When it comes to mobilizing a fan base, Ms. Swift, they say, is in a class by herself. Even Beyoncé has not shown the same selling power. First-day presales for "The Eras Tour" totaled an estimated $ 37 million, while "Renaissance" generated about $ 7 million.
At the moment, theater chains aren't thinking much beyond the weekend. The last two months have been quiet for theaters, with hits like "The Nun II" (Warner Bros.) offset by a string of duds, including "Dumb Money," "Blue Beetle," "The Creator" and "Expend4bles."
Two major movies originally expected this fall, "Kraven the Hunter" and "Dune: Part Two," were pushed into next year because of the actors' strike. (Until the strike is resolved, SAG-AFTRA, as the actors' union in known, has barred its members from engaging in any publicity efforts for films and TV shows that have already been completed.)
Theater companies, of course, make most of their money at the concession counter, and AMC, for one, is counting on Ms. Swift's fans to come hungry. Among other items, the chain plans to sell popcorn in collectible tubs for $ 20.

Terence Davies, 77, Poetic Filmmaker Who Drew From Literature and His Own Life: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With a poetic sensibility, "Distant Voices, Still Lives" echoed his Liverpool upbringing, and "The House of Mirth" put Edith Wharton's novel on the screen.
Terence Davies, a British screenwriter and director known for his poetic, intensely personal films like "Distant Voices, Still Lives" and literary adaptations like "The House of Mirth," died on Saturday at his home in the village of Mistley, Essex, on the southwest coast of England. He was 77.
His manager, John Taylor, confirmed the death but did not specify the cause, saying only that Mr. Davies had died after "a short illness."
An obituary from the British Film Institute said, "No one made movies like Davies, who precisely sculpted out of a subjective past, creating films that glided on waves of contemplation and observation."
The very specific "Distant Voices, Still Lives" (1988) starred Pete Postlethwaite as a violently abusive Liverpool father who terrorizes his wife and children. When the film was rereleased in 2018, The Guardian called it the director's "early autobiographical masterpiece" and declared it "as gripping as any thriller."
When critics referred to Mr. Davies's film dramas as musicals, they were only half joking. Songs are sung or heard in his movies just as they are in real life -- at bars, at celebrations, at church and on the radio.
In "Distant Voices," the townspeople and their children sing "Beer Barrel Polka" in a bomb shelter to distract themselves from the horrors of World War II. Audiences hear "If You Knew Susie" at a wedding reception, "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling" while Mr. Postlethwaite takes a curry comb to a horse and "Taking a Chance on Love" issuing from a radio in the background even during the most brutal scenes.
The film won the International Critics' Prize at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival.
"The House of Mirth" (2000), based on Edith Wharton's 1905 novel, starred Gillian Anderson as the doomed heroine, Lily Bart. Writing in The Village Voice, J. Hoberman called the film "brilliantly adapted" and Ms. Anderson's performance "unexpectedly stunning."
Stephen Holden of The New York Times found the film "funereally gloomy," but he had to admit, he wrote, that the story was "so gripping, it almost doesn't matter how it's couched." And The San Francisco Chronicle praised it as "such a mesmerizing downer." For all that, it grossed only $ 5 million worldwide (a little more than $ 9 million in today's currency).
The industry eventually forgave him for his commercial limitations and continued to back his films, including "The Deep Blue Sea" (2011), starring Rachel Weisz, which was based on Terence Rattigan's 1952 play about a judge's wife having an emotionally destructive affair.
It was not a blockbuster either, but critics were generally admiring. A review in New York magazine noted Mr. Davies's "ability to blend the particular with the iconic, to turn ordinary moments into something almost mythical."
Terence Davies was born on Nov. 10, 1945, in Liverpool, England, the youngest of 10 children in a working-class family.
When Terence was 7, his father died of cancer. He grew up in his mother's Roman Catholic faith but developed doubts and rejected religion completely when he was 22.
"Then I realized it's a lie," he recalled in an interview with The New Yorker in 2017. "Men in frocks -- nothing else."
He left school at 15 and worked as a shipping clerk and a bookkeeper. More than a decade later, he changed course and enrolled in a drama school in Coventry, more than 100 miles south of Liverpool, near Birmingham.
He was still a student when he began work on his first short film, "Children" (1976), later edited into "The Terence Davies Trilogy" (1983).
The next half-century or so brought Mr. Davies awards, film festival attention and a prestigious list of credits.
He did "The Long Day Closes" (1992), a young gay man's battle with the church, his family and his own guilt; "The Neon Bible" (1995), starring Gena Rowlands, based on John Kennedy Toole's novel, set in the American South; the documentary "Of Time and the City" (2008), a history of and reflection on his hometown, Liverpool (a "lovely, astringent film," A.O. Scott wrote in The Times); and "Sunset Song" (2015), starring Agyness Deyn, based on Lewis Grassic Gibbon's novel about coming of age in early 1900s Scotland.
Finally, Mr. Davies, who always said that he was drawn to the past, began to explore the lives of the poets themselves.
He made "A Quiet Passion" (2016), in which Cynthia Nixon portrays Emily Dickinson, the reclusive 19th-century American poet. The Times's critic found that Mr. Davies possessed "a poetic sensibility perfectly suited to his subject and a deep, idiosyncratic intuition about what might have made her tick."
His last film was "Benediction" (2021), a drama about the World War I poet Siegfried Sassoon. The New Yorker called it "an energizing and inspiring movie about the vanity of existence itself."
Mr. Davies, who was gay and never married, leaves no known survivors and had lived alone since 1980. He had tried the gay dating scene, he said, and dismissed it for, among other reasons, what he called its devotion to narcissism.
Lamenting the age of complete license -- in the arts as well as in daily life, he told L.A. Weekly in 2012: "The first thing that goes is subtlety. The first thing that goes is any kind of restraint or even wit sometimes. I don't know how to deal with that in the modern world."

Full text: Wes Anderson, Pedro Almodóvar and Godfrey Reggio have films this fall that are less than an hour each.
If it's epic cinema you seek this fall, many marathons await: Martin Scorsese's sprawling Oklahoma murder ballad "Killers of the Flower Moon" (3 hours 26 minutes); Ridley Scott's lush and bloody biopic "Napoleon" (2 hours 37 minutes); the ambitious, Jennifer Lawrence-less "Hunger Games" prequel "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" (2 hours 37 minutes). Even "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour," that musical behemoth slinking from stadiums to screen, commands a rigorous 2 hours and 48.
Flip the telescope though, and movies are also getting very, very small. In the discombobulated midst of a strike and a festival season, stand-alone shorts -- a category generally confined to film-nerd niche or career steppingstone -- have suddenly emerged as the passion projects of several name-brand auteurs. Why well-established directors would pivot to a format not exactly famed for its commercial viability feels like something of a mystery, but the presence of enthusiastic benefactors may offer a clue: a vaunted French fashion house, a streaming giant, a Soderbergh.
The participation of Netflix provides an unusually broad platform for Wes Anderson, who has perhaps most committed to the bit; "The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar" serves as the quixotic centerpiece of his four-part collection inspired by the endlessly adaptable British novelist Roald Dahl and unrolled on the site over consecutive days in late September.
"Henry Sugar," about a wealthy wastrel (Benedict Cumberbatch) who finds his purpose in the mystical third-eye teachings of an eccentric yogi (Ben Kingsley), seems designed to fit Anderson's gifts as a jewel-box maximalist. The starry cast runs full force with his nesting-doll plots and deadpan drolleries, the color palette comes saturated in a Pantone riot of blues, pinks and egg-yolk yellows, and the tone flips nimbly from tender to absurd, more Dahl sweetness than arsenic.
At 39 minutes, "Henry Sugar" is easily the longest and most elaborate in the series, and the only one to get a limited release in theaters (with admissions priced accordingly, between $ 5 and $ 8). It's also probably the closest to a sure-thing Oscar nominee, a recognition that may or may not extend to the lovely but evanescent "Asteroid City," Anderson's winsome feature-length dip into retrofuturism from earlier this year.
Pedro Almodóvar, the resident romantic surrealist of Spanish cinema, seems to have less lofty goals for "Strange Way of Life," his featherweight dollop of fashion-cowboy whimsy presented and costumed by the venerable Parisian label Saint Laurent. (It's not the brand's first foray into film; they backed the perennial French provocateur Gaspar Noé's demented 2019 short "Lux Aeterna," which also had its premiere at Cannes.)
The plot, such as it is, rests purely on gestural melodrama, with a "Brokeback Mountain" twist: A stoic sheriff, Jake (Ethan Hawke), and his onetime fellow gunslinger and secret paramour, Silva (Pedro Pascal), are reunited after 25 years apart. The passion between them -- also telegraphed by handsome young doppelgängers in lusty flashbacks -- still burns, but it's complicated by the criminal urges of Silva's violent, petulant son (George Steane).
Almodóvar's gaze is more like a series of fun house mirrors here, passing through classic dime-store-novel narrative, the macho-man canon of midcentury Technicolor westerns and the winky camp of queering it all in circa-2023 couture. (Pascal's Kelly-green jacket, the production notes take pains to point out, is a tribute to one James Stewart wore in 1952's "Bend of the River," though its bedazzlement tilts more Ibiza disco than dusty frontier).
For all the novelty of watching two midlife male movie stars declare their love and linger in bathtubs, "Strange" feels teasingly incomplete at 30 minutes, galloping off before it's hardly begun. It seems smart, then, that it's being paired theatrically with Almodóvar's other recent English-language experiment, the more substantial 2020 short "The Human Voice," featuring Tilda Swinton as a woman undone by her departing lover (it opens Oct. 4).
The luxe artifice of those films feels several galaxies removed from Godfrey Reggio, the former monk turned avant-garde documentarian whose pointed social consciousness and wordless, kaleidoscopic catalog has made him a sort of gnomic godhead for devoted cinephiles and stoners alike. But Hollywood still finds its way to the Santa Fe octogenarian's door: Steven Soderbergh, a fan since 1983's seminal "Koyaanisqatsi," is listed as executive producer on the 52-minute "Once Within a Time," and will travel to several cities to promote it. (Reggio is also the subject of a MoMA retrospective with his longtime collaborator, Philip Glass, that runs through Oct. 4, where the new short plays daily before releasing more widely in theaters.)
Set to a clamorous Glass score, "Once" unleashes a whirling torrent of images, churned into a daguerreotype steampunk fever dream: merry-go-rounds, mushroom clouds, screaming chimpanzees in VR headsets. Mike Tyson appears as a benevolent wizard, and the climate activist Greta Thunberg as a stern bobblehead. "Is it the sunset or the dawn?" an interstitial card demands, as sand runs through a monolithic hourglass; both hope and apocalypse are heavily implied. At 83, Reggio probably knows more than most about the tyranny of time; onscreen at least, if not in life, new rules can be applied.

Full text: In Rudy Valdez's poignant but shortsighted documentary, the guitarist's magic comes alive in performances and childhood recollections.
Since his breakthrough at the Fillmore in San Francisco and then a star-making performance at Woodstock in 1969, Carlos Santana's fusion of improvisational Latin rock and blues has been regarded as transcendent.
In the director Rudy Valdez's poignant but shortsighted documentary, "Carlos," that same magic comes alive through performance clips from various eras of the Mexican guitarist's half-century-long career and commentary about his life offstage. Santana's ethereal mood imbues the movie with a numinous feel -- even a childhood anecdote that he shares about his father communicating to birds while playing the violin at sunset is delivered with an affecting cosmic touch.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Although Santana, 76, reveals some raw details of his life -- his father's infidelity, experiencing sexual abuse as a child -- the portrait, rendered primarily through interviews, leaves a lot out. For fans wondering about the anti-trans comments that he made at a show in July and then apologized for, there's nothing in the documentary that mentions his political stances. The film presents Santana without critique.
Other interviews can feel muted. His sisters, exhibiting hesitant body language, don't seem like they want to say too much. His bandmate and second wife, Cindy Blackman Santana, is even quieter. Deeper insights from a rock critic or music historian would have enriched the film to fully convey not just what Santana's legacy is but what it means. Still, this controlled documentary captivates as a soulful personal history, even if it doesn't exactly transcend.

Full text: Jim Ryan, who has been with the company for nearly 30 years, has led one of the most dominant businesses in the video game industry.
Jim Ryan, who leads Sony's PlayStation video game console business, will retire next year, Sony said on Wednesday.
Mr. Ryan joined Sony in 1994, and has held various executive positions at the company. He became the chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony, in 2019.
"I've found it increasingly difficult to reconcile living in Europe and working in North America," Mr. Ryan, who is British, wrote in a blog post announcing his retirement.
Hiroki Totoki, another top executive at Sony, will become the interim chief executive of SIE after Mr. Ryan's departure in March, the company said. Bloomberg earlier reported his planned retirement.
Sony has long been one of the most dominant companies in the lucrative video game industry, publishing popular franchises like Spider-Man and The Last of Us. In 2020, the company released the PlayStation 5, its latest console, to critical acclaim. Mr. Ryan wrote in a blog post in July that Sony had sold more than 40 million PlayStation 5s.
Sony's chief competitors are Nintendo, which makes the Switch console, and Microsoft, which makes the Xbox. Sony has long held an edge over Microsoft in the number of hit games it makes that are exclusive to its system, driving gamers' interest in the PlayStation.
To compete, Microsoft pioneered a new form of video game distribution: a Netflix-style subscription service in which gamers pay a monthly fee for a library of titles, rather than buying individual games.
Microsoft has also been on a spending spree in hopes of catching up to Sony, buying Bethesda Game Studios and a host of other studios in 2020 for $ 7.5 billion. Sony was a fierce objector to Microsoft's other big purchase: a $ 69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard that is still under review by regulators.
Mr. Ryan testified in a recorded video deposition with the Federal Trade Commission that he believed Microsoft's acquisition of Activision's library of games would harm PlayStation users and limit competition.
He said he believed Microsoft could withhold Call of Duty, Activision's biggest game, from PlayStation "to damage us." But a federal judge didn't buy his arguments, and the Activision deal could close next month after a British regulator's review.
Sony has also made acquisitions. Last year, it bought the game studio Bungie, which makes the Destiny franchise, for $ 3.6 billion.

The Year Lou Reed Gave Up On Music: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Between quitting the Velvet Underground and writing "Walk on the Wild Side," the singer endured a long stretch of doubt, frustration and failure.
Lou Reed strode onto the stage at Max's Kansas City late on a Sunday night in August 1970. "Good evening," he said, addressing the crowd. "We're called the Velvet Underground. You're allowed to dance, in case you don't know. And, uh, that's about it." He introduced "I'm Waiting for the Man," a heroin addict's codependent lament to his dealer, as "a tender folk song from the early '50s about love between man and subway ... I'm sure you'll all enjoy it."
The Velvets were in the middle of a 10-week residency at Max's, the outré tavern and artist hangout on Park Avenue South. The place was full of the usual demimonde, as it had been for most of the shows, but also in attendance were Sid and Toby Reed, Lou's parents, who had made the trip from Long Island. Danny Fields, a regular at Andy Warhol's Factory who would soon discover the Ramones, was there, as he was virtually every night.
Up near the front of the stage was Brigid Berlin, Warhol's nominal receptionist and daughter of the Hearst Corporation president, Richard E. Berlin. A society girl whose parents encouraged her to take amphetamines to control her weight, she earned the nickname Brigid Polk for her habit of poking people with speed-filled hypodermics.
Like Warhol, she was an obsessive taper, and had recorded a number of Velvets shows that summer. She had her trusty Sony mono TC-120 cassette recorder with her. Holding the microphone was Jim Carroll, a beautiful young poet. The tape would soon be passed around the underground and would eventually be released as an album -- since Reed had decided this would be the last Velvet Underground show.
It was a strange and pivotal moment. Though the Velvet Underground are recognized now as one of the most influential rock groups ever, a touchstone for multiple generations of artists from David Bowie to Patti Smith to R.E.M., the band was a commercial failure, and Reed knew it. Through their association with Warhol, the Velvets had occupied a rarefied spot in the culture, performing at art galleries and happenings, but they couldn't get on the radio and it looked as if the moment had passed them by.
The Sixties, an era the Velvets were in many ways at odds with, were over. Rock music was bigger than ever -- but here was Reed, five years in, playing a tiny stage at his old haunt in a shadow of his original band. The drummer Moe Tucker, their heartbeat and Reed's trusted ally, was out of the picture, pregnant with her first child. Reed had long ago fired Warhol as the manager. He'd also fired John Cale, the Welsh avant-gardist who was his creative equal when they formed the band together.
Now, he was firing himself.
But the demise of the Velvet Underground was known only to one person in Max's that night: Lou Reed. And despite this, or maybe because of it, Reed led his band through an inspired set.
When the group launched into "Sweet Jane," Reed adjusted the gender-fluid lyrics, putting Jack in a vest instead of a corset. Perhaps the change was for his family's benefit. In any case, the performance was joyous; some rhythm-impaired fans tried to clap along, and Reed said, "C'mon, you can do better than that!" One imagines dancers hopping and gyrating in the low-ceilinged room: humid, hot, packed, redolent of sweat, cigarettes and weed.
The ambient banter picked up on Berlin's tape would be nearly as valuable to future archivists as the songs that were recorded.
"Go get me a double Pernod," Carroll can be heard instructing someone.
"What are ya lookin' for?" a guy inquires, with a classic New York drug-hustle cadence.
"You got a down?" Carroll asks slurrily. "What is it? A Tuinal? Gimme it immediately."
Finishing up the first set, Reed hollered, "It's the beginning of a new age," then followed "New Age" with "Beginning to See the Light."
A man who sees each of his albums as sequential chapters of a novel does not draft his final set list randomly.
Backstage, after the second set, Reed told his bandmates of his intention. The guitarist Sterling Morrison argued with him about his decision to quit the band. They still had a week of shows to do, and the album wasn't even finished. Reed wouldn't budge.
Word spread quickly as people lingered over drinks. "Someone came out and said, 'Lou just quit,"' Fields recalled. He rushed to find Berlin. "Did you get that?" he asked her, gesturing to her recorder.
"Yeah!" she said. He informed her that she'd just recorded the final Velvet Underground performance.
Reed clomped down the staircase and out onto the avenue. He stowed his guitar in the trunk of his parents' car, and Sid Reed drove home to the old house in Freeport, where his son would be staying for a while.
Reed spent his first days after leaving the Velvet Underground at home holed up in his room, sleeping. He confessed his depression to friends; his sister believes he was suffering a nervous breakdown. Whether the crisis triggered or followed his decision to leave the Velvets is an open question. He started therapy again -- a remarkable move, given his harsh experience with psychiatrists and electroconvulsive therapy in college -- and possibly started taking medication, too. He'd take long beach walks with Seymoure, the dog he had adopted with his girlfriend at Syracuse University, Shelley Albin. He began working part-time as a typist for his dad's accounting firm for $ 40 a week.
"Loaded," the Velvet Underground album Reed had been working on, was released in late September, and he was startled when he heard it. There had been some changes from what he'd recalled as the final recordings. The incantatory coda to "New Age" had been shortened, and the bridge to "Sweet Jane" had been cut entirely, the song ending in a radio-friendly fade at 3:15.
In its original versions, "Sweet Jane" hinged on that bridge -- the "heavenly wine and roses" section -- which amplified the song's self-consciousness with flowery phrases that sound lifted from a greeting card, followed by a string of sing-along-ready la-la-la's. Anyone who "ever played a part," posited Reed in the song, wouldn't "turn around and hate it." He might've been referring to his own performance as "Lou Reed," rock star.
Reed would rail at these edits, which he claimed were released without his consent, although the bassist Doug Yule would maintain that Reed made them himself. "He edited it. You have to understand, at the time, the motivation," Yule said. "Lou was, and all of us were, intent on one thing: to be successful.... You had to have a hit, and a hit had to be up-tempo, short, with no digressions ... you wanted a hook and something to feed the hook and that was it."
"Loaded" was released to little fanfare. Label promotion was minimal, unsurprising for a band whose frontman and primary songwriter had just quit. There were no hits, as the issuing of singles was halfhearted. By November, Reed's bandmates were back at the Atlantic Records studios, working on a new "Velvet Underground" album.
Reed, meanwhile, recorded demos in his childhood bedroom. He was also thinking about roads less traveled. Earlier that year, the University of Chicago Press published "Selected Essays of Delmore Schwartz," a volume that the author, Reed's mentor at Syracuse University, had begun compiling in his final years. Schwartz had pushed Reed, his star student, to be a "real" writer, telling him pop-song lyrics were worthless. Schwartz's words stuck with him. Reed was also thinking about Shelley Albin. He called her, wanting to reconnect. When she heard his voice on the line, she was in a room with her new baby and her family.
"You must have the wrong number," she told him, and hung up. The two never spoke again, and Albin destroyed all the letters Reed had sent her over the years. She didn't want to be tempted to share them once he became famous.
Around the same time, Reed picked up the phone and called Bettye Kronstad, a woman he had invited to the last Velvets show at Max's, where he'd given her a sweaty kiss and a promise to get in touch.
Reed first met Kronstad -- who, some years hence, would become his first wife -- in the spring of 1968. She was visiting their mutual friend Lincoln Swados, Reed's troubled college roommate, at Mount Sinai Hospital's psychiatric ward. Reed was sauntering out of the elevator as Kronstad was leaving Swados's room. "Hey, you! Beautiful!" Reed snapped as she breezed past him. He reached out and swatted her behind.
She turned, angry, and sized him up. Reed was dressed head to toe in denim, with pearl-snap buttons on his shirt, frayed bell-bottoms, and a tumescent air of rock star entitlement. His well-groomed curly hair added a couple of inches to his height.
He asked what she was doing in a psych ward. "You look normal," he said.
After learning of their shared connection to Swados and flirting a bit more, Kronstad agreed to meet Reed for a drink at the West End Bar, near her apartment and Columbia University, where she was working as a research assistant. Reed got hammered on Scotch, ranting about his problems with John Cale and the Velvets. Kronstad walked him to the subway, not expecting to see him again. But Reed didn't forget her, and in a gesture that suggested he was already planning his second act, he invited her to his final Velvets show at Max's.
Seeing him perform, from her spot in the crowd midway back, she felt him singing certain songs directly to her. She recalled the look on his face as "wild" and "almost pleading." After Reed called her the following week from his parents' house, they soon began seeing each other.
Kronstad was slim, with sparkling blue eyes and dirty blond hair, which she had cut short. She came from German-Scandinavian stock and a broken home with an abusive father, a World War II veteran who had fought at Normandy and suffered severe anxiety likely caused by PTSD, although it had yet to become a diagnostic classification. Like Reed, he'd received electroconvulsive therapy as part of his treatment.
Kronstad was smart but restless. After receiving a scholarship to study at Columbia, she'd begun taking acting classes with Sanford Meisner at the Playhouse on 54th Street. She lived in Manhattan with a couple of roommates; on weekends, Reed met her in the city, or she'd take the Long Island Rail Road to his parents' house. Her style was preppy, and she impressed Reed's parents. She was Protestant, but came across, in Long Island Jewish parlance, as "a very nice goil."
Amid this throwback into his family and his childhood culture, Reed was rethinking his entire identity. Before the Velvets, he'd considered returning to school. Now, five years later, he turned his attention back to literature. "He was writing poetry and seriously reflecting," Kronstad recalled. "He was very disappointed about the Velvet Underground not being as successful as they should be. He did want to continue in the music business. But while he was living at home, he was trying poetry. That was the guy I fell in love with."
His first significant publication came through Fusion, the Boston-based music and politics magazine that had always supported the Velvets. When Fusion launched a book series, the editor, Robert Somma, had the idea for an essay collection around the theme of rock 'n' roll deaths. Jimi Hendrix had asphyxiated after ingesting a massive quantity of barbiturates that September. Janis Joplin died of a heroin overdose not three weeks later. Brian Jones had drowned in his swimming pool the previous summer. "Why don't you take a shot at writing an essay?" Somma asked Reed over the phone. Reed agreed in an instant.
"It wasn't like I had to cajole him into it, believe me," said Somma, who'd already agreed to publish some of Reed's poems. "I don't think we paid him for it. I don't think he cared."
"No One Waved Goodbye: A Casualty Report on Rock and Roll" was a landmark of pop-music criticism. It included work by the pioneering Australian music journalist Lillian Roxon, an early Velvets champion; a Q. and A. with Danny Fields; even a piece by the Velvets' former manager, Al Aronowitz. Reed's "Fallen Knights and Fallen Ladies," however, is the book's only essay by a musician, and he showed a remarkable dual consciousness, as both artist and fan.
"At the age when identity is a problem," Reed writes, "some people join rock and roll bands and perform for other people who share the same difficulties. The age difference between performer and beholder in rock is not large.... The singer has a soul but feels he isn't loved offstage. Or, perhaps worse, feels he shines only onstage and off is wilted, a shell as common as the garden gardenia. But we are all as common as snowflakes, aren't we?"
Reed was proud of "Fallen Knights and Fallen Ladies." It was at odds with the mainstream suburban lifestyle he had fallen into -- working a day job, seeing his girlfriend on the weekend. But that was a more unsettled situation than it appeared. Bickering with his father, who was now his employer, too, sometimes got heated. "If we went out to dinner with his parents, Chinese food on a Sunday night, Lou just started drinking and couldn't stop," Kronstad said. "I'd try to keep up with him. It was just ridiculous."
The Dec. 24 issue of Rolling Stone ran a review of "Loaded." In it, Lenny Kaye, Patti Smith's future guitarist, praised Reed's "incredible finesse" as a songwriter, and called it "easily one of the best albums to show up this or any year." He wrote with even greater enthusiasm about the farewell run at Max's, noting Brigid Berlin's recordings in particular, then circulating as a bootleg. On paper, the Velvets still existed -- but their posthumous apotheosis had already begun.
Danny Fields adored Lou Reed from the get-go, as both an artist and a friend. He wanted Reed to keep making music. So becoming his manager seemed like a good idea.
It wasn't. The arrangement lasted two weeks. Fields, a music journalist and self-made talent scout who now worked at Atlantic Records, tried to convince his bosses to sign his new client as a solo act. But considering Reed had torpedoed the Velvet Underground just after the label signed them, that didn't go well. So Fields shopped him around. Reed obsessed over Fields's progress, calling him at all hours, demanding constant reports, giving orders. Fields bowed out.
"I couldn't take it," Fields said. "It was horrible."
Reed's suburban rewind became a double life. At home, he avoided the New York scene's pressures. Kronstad slept on a foldout couch in the den, which Reed's mother made up for her; on Sunday, they'd all have brunch with bagels and whitefish. Reed taught Kronstad to play tennis, de rigueur among aspirational Long Islanders. But he was an impatient teacher, and the first lesson ended in a fight.
Kronstad shared her interests in turn. She'd grown up riding horses on her father's farm in western Pennsylvania, and one weekend took Reed to the Equestrian Center in Hempstead. He failed the riding test, and had to remain in the corral while his girlfriend cantered down the trail without him. "He was humiliated," she recalls.
Sometimes they'd spend weekends at her place in Manhattan, and he'd introduce her to his friends. She felt the condescension. She was dismissed as "straight," and snidely referred to as "the cocktail waitress," according to Fields. Reed tried to forge a bond between her and Brigid Berlin, given the latter's upscale pedigree. But it never took. So Reed largely remained in retreat on Long Island, and doubled down on his writing.
The St. Mark's Poetry Project was run out of the 17th-century St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery by Anne Waldman, an heir to the Beats and the New York School poets. The project was an offshoot of a social program, Creative Arts for Alienated Youth. One such youth, Patti Smith, made her semi-musical debut there in February 1971. She recited "Oath," a poem that began "Christ died for somebody's sins but not mine." She also sang Hank Ballard's "Annie Had a Baby" and Kurt Weill's "Mack the Knife," and read a poem about a car crash accompanied on electric guitar by Lenny Kaye. It was a striking display, and people were buzzing about it.
When Reed appeared on the same altar the following month, it was with a sheaf of poems and no guitar. It was his first public appearance since the Max's farewell, and his first proper poetry reading, sharing a bill with Allen Ginsberg and the Velvets fan Jim Carroll. Gerard Malanga, Danny Fields, and others from the Factory scene turned out to witness the transmogrification, or whatever it was that Reed had in store. Before the reading, Reed was anxious but worked the room like a pro, flirting and glad-handing, Kronstad hovering patiently nearby.
At the lectern, Reed recited the lyrics to "Sister Ray," from the second Velvet Underground record. He read "The Murder Mystery," reframing the experimental sound collage from the band's third album as concrete poetry. He read "Heroin," after which Ginsberg clapped vigorously. Reed sounded nervous at points: rushing through endings, knocking into the tape recorder as he turned pages. He introduced new material as his "gay poems," specifying that they were "pro-" gay. There was a paean to dancing with a man ("the grip ... so strong"), with an aside noting "my father will not speak to me."
Another poem suggested cruising a longhaired boy at the library. Reed described the choice between presenting straight or not, and he imagined how nice it would be to just linger outside a movie theater, "arm in arm," in a world where no one would take any special notice. He noted that John Rechy's pioneering 1963 novel "City of Night" was one of his favorite books, and read a wistful prose fragment written from "out-and-out admiration" of it, in which a man, feeling over-the-hill, cruises men on a rainy night, then returns home to his girlfriend. Reed followed it with "Bettye," an evident celebration of his girlfriend, and the lyrics to "Andy's Chest," professing his love for Warhol.
He ended the reading with a startling announcement: He was giving up music entirely to focus on poetry.
How much truth was in the declaration, only Reed knew. But the crowd was stunned by his earnestness. "Rather than being the 'cool' Lou Reed everyone expected to entertain them, he was sincere," recalls Kronstad. "People seemed embarrassed for him."
At Max's after the reading, Reed tried to put on a good face, at one point challenging the rock critic Richard Meltzer to a drinking contest. But he felt the response to his reading had been decidedly lukewarm, and by the night's end, Reed was drunk and miserable. Kronstad recalls him "with his head in his arms on a table in the back room, incredibly sad. He felt totally rejected."
Soon after the event, Reed decided to revive his music career. Kronstad remembers a night of heavy drinking that ended at "a Long Island gay bar," where Reed was received as prodigal royalty. They closed the place, and she drove them home in his dad's Mercedes; they both passed out in his parents' den. The next morning, Reed laid out his new career plans to Kronstad. He also proposed marriage.
Startled, Kronstad declined, asking for time to think about it. She figured Reed was an alcoholic. But she also figured he was a genius, and was confident that, for better or worse, he was en route to becoming a very famous, paid-in-full rock star.
The path back to rock stardom was circuitous.
Around this time, Reed had been in conversation with an Off Broadway director named Carmen Capalbo, who was trying to stage a rock musical based on Nelson Algren's novel "A Walk on the Wild Side." Reed had been approached to possibly contribute some songs, and even after the project fizzled, the book's themes, and its title, stuck with him.
The first to hear what he would do with them was the rock 'n' roll power couple Lisa and Richard Robinson. She was an ambitious music journalist, he an artists-and-repertoire man and youth-culture barometer at RCA Records. They both revered the Velvet Underground, and after meeting Reed through Fields, they had him over for dinner at their Upper West Side apartment in the spring of 1971.
That night, and on subsequent ones, they recorded him playing songs on acoustic guitar. Some were outtakes from the Velvets era; others were new, including a giddy sketch about Manhattan life with a hooky chorus revolving around the phrase "take a walk on the wild side." Richard liked what he heard, and thought he could get Reed a record deal. He did.

Full text: Mortal Kombat, Super Mario Bros. and more are coming this season.
It has been such a fruitful year for video games that you couldn't blame someone for wanting a light fall lineup to finish titles like Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur's Gate 3. For better or worse, this season is stacked with AAA releases, long-awaited sequels and promising independent games. (Some games will be available before their official launch dates because of early-access programs.)
September
MORTAL KOMBAT 1 The fighting franchise that drew crowds at arcades in the early 1990s has conjured new gruesome fatalities for its second narrative reboot. A cast of familiar characters such as Scorpion, Kitana and Johnny Cage will be assisted in battle by partner fighters who leap onscreen. (Sept. 19; PC, Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 5, Microsoft Xbox Series X|S)
LIES OF P This is not Disney's Pinocchio. In a retelling set in the Belle Époque era, a puppet with one mechanical arm wields rapiers and greatswords against giant monsters in his way. Success will require the meticulous combat timing of the punishing Soulslike genre, which includes Dark Souls and Elden Ring. (Sept. 19; PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
EL PASO, ELSEWHERE Bullet time -- à la "The Matrix" and Max Payne -- is a crucial resource for a folklore researcher who descends into a supernatural motel filled with werewolves and fallen angels to confront his lover, the vampire lord Draculae. Designed by a small studio, this third-person shooter exudes neo-noir. (Sept. 26; PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S)
CYBERPUNK 2077: PHANTOM LIBERTY Nearly three years after the buggy release of the hyped role-playing game Cyberpunk 2077, an expansion thrusts the mercenary V into a new section of Night City as a secret agent.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The sequel to the 2018 video game will let players scour three boroughs in a love letter to the city and its Spidey savior.
Reality and fantasy were deeply intertwined in Marvel's Spider-Man, where gamers swung from webs above Lincoln Center and leaped from the Empire State Building's spire into the crowds leaving the subway station at Herald Square. The comic book icon also brought his own landmarks to that version of New York City, which hosted the Avengers headquarters a few blocks north of the United Nations and a supervillain prison in the East River.
The designers at Insomniac Games are now expanding the superhero's jurisdiction beyond Manhattan for the sequel, to be released for the PlayStation 5 on Oct. 20. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 swells into Queens and Brooklyn (including Coney Island attractions), testing a design team responsible for nearly doubling the real estate of the 2018 original.
Replicating parts of the largest city in the United States was also a bigger challenge this time because the process began while many designers at Insomniac, which has offices in Burbank, Calif., and Durham, N.C., were working from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic.
The game's design director, Josue Benavidez, said his research involved contacting organizations like the Center for Brooklyn History, posting on Reddit groups devoted to the borough and calling businesses near the buildings he was studying.
"It's been a lot of living in Google Maps," Benavidez said.
Several open-world video games have leaned on New York's familiar topography, including Grand Theft Auto IV and Tom Clancy's The Division; in Assassin's Creed III, players can scamper across an 18th-century version of the city. But New York is an inextricable part of the Spider-Man mythos, from its comic book origins -- Peter Parker was born in Queens -- to its movie iterations.
In the franchise's first live-action movie, 2002's "Spider-Man," Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider at Columbia University, rushes to his dying Uncle Ben outside the New York Public Library at Bryant Park and rescues passengers on a Roosevelt Island tram tormented by the Green Goblin.
Insomniac, the creator of Spyro the Dragon and Ratchet & Clank, thrilled players five years ago by letting them swing their way through sights like Central Park and Times Square. The addition of Brooklyn and Queens in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 brought new design challenges that included learning the quirky geometry of brownstones and rowhouses.
Designers also wanted to vary the urban landscape, ensuring that important sites from the comics, like Aunt May's house and Brooklyn Visions Academy, were clearly represented. Another difficulty was identifying where to end the playable area in boroughs that stretch into Long Island.
"The good news was that Spider-Man became successful," said Bryan Intihar, who returns as the game's senior creative director. "But with success comes greater expectations."
In the sequel, players will control two Spider-Men as they navigate new responsibilities and powers, including the ability to jet through the skies with "web wings." Parker and Miles Morales, who is from Brooklyn, will twist into knots over a symbiote suit that warps Parker into a villain from the comics, the alien parasite called Venom.
The drama unfolds across a landscape of construction cranes, water towers, bridges and tunnels -- infrastructure that Insomniac designers studied for months.
"Everything is very intentionally placed," Benavidez said, noting that there must be plenty of objects to show off the physics of Spider-Man's web-slinging abilities.
One design solution was to plant more trees than you would find in the real New York City. Some changes provide sly commentary, with additional greenery and shade in the virtual Times Square and a plethora of newspaper kiosks bordering refuges like Union Square Park. Other choices skew closer to reality: Trash cans and heaps of garbage fill the city's sidewalks.
"When there is combat, people like breaking things," reasoned Jacinda Chew, the game's senior art director.
Designing a believable New York takes time, and Benavidez discussed the lengthy process at the 2019 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. "We wanted the world to feel like a real place, like the actual city," he told an audience, referring to the original game.
A digital sketch of that version of New York City included generic skyscrapers with gray facades and black windows dotting the horizon. Developers then used their visual research -- culled from online images and field photographs -- to define the scale of the city and breathe life into its avenues.
Once designers had enough information, they began creating versions of the high-rises and brownstones that characterize a city block. Many of those designs were then fed into a procedural generation software called Houdini, which helps eliminate tedious tasks like placing individual street lamps.
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was built specifically for the more powerful PlayStation 5, which allowed Chew's team to design buildings with greater depth. Spider-Man may see more than his reflection when he scales a skyscraper, with some windows that peer into office cubicles and living rooms.
Depicting a famous city, however, takes more than meticulous renderings. Although the Chrysler Building appears in the 2018 Spider-Man game, it is missing in a 2020 spinoff, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, because Insomniac could not reach a copyright agreement with the building's new owners. The studio says the skyscraper will also be absent in October's sequel.
Expectations are high for Spider-Man 2, which may be the biggest PlayStation exclusive of the year. Insomniac said last year that the original Spider-Man and the Miles Morales spinoff had sold a combined 33 million copies.
A spokeswoman for the studio declined to address the budget or size of the development team for Spider-Man 2, but making high-fidelity games of that size can require hundreds of millions of dollars. Documents from the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit against the Microsoft-Activision merger included an accidental disclosure of budget data from Sony, the publisher of the Spider-Man games, revealing that other popular titles like The Last of Us Part II and Horizon Forbidden West cost upward of $ 200 million each.
Market analysts say major studios have relied on established intellectual property to mitigate their risk. But characters with established followings in action movies and comic books do not necessarily have the same appeal in video games.
Over the summer, Axios examined recent entries in the genre, including Gotham Knights and Marvel's Avengers, that sold poorly and drew negative reviews. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, by the studio behind the successful Batman: Arkham games, has been repeatedly delayed and mired in staff departures.
"Spider-Man fans will at least give it a fair trial," said Andre James, global head of media and entertainment practice for the consulting firm Bain & Company. "But the world of possibilities that tech has enabled may need a lot of time and iteration to get right."
The team behind the Spider-Man sequel believes it has already found a winning formula, one that whisks players into the superhero's universe by adding a touch of realism and a sucker punch of New York attitude.
"What we have tried to focus on," Intihar, the game's creative director, said, "is respecting the DNA of the franchise without being afraid of mixing things up."

What's the anatomy of a fall movie season? Although the writers' and actors' strikes have kept Hollywood in suspense, the calendar is, for now, still filled with exciting titles, including work from established masters (Martin Scorsese, Sofia Coppola, David Fincher) and relative breakouts like Justine Triet, the director of, well, "Anatomy of a Fall," which won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May.

PRISCILLA Mention Elvis, and there's no need to specify a last name. Sofia Coppola, no stranger to chronicling the isolating effects of fame, elevates Mrs. Presley to a similarly iconic stature in this look at one of the most watched marriages in rock 'n' roll.

THE MARVELS Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani) and Captain Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) join forces to take down whoever is threatening the Marvel Cinematic Universe these days. Nia DaCosta (the 2021 "Candyman" remake) directed. (Nov. 10 in theaters)

MAY DECEMBER Todd Haynes investigates what constitutes realistic acting -- and what attracts viewers to tabloid sensationalism -- in this drama, which casts Natalie Portman as a TV star shadowing her latest role's infamous real-life inspiration (Julianne Moore), a woman whose past is not dissimilar from Mary Kay Letourneau's. With Charles Melton. (Nov. 17 in theaters, Dec. 1 on Netflix)
NEXT GOAL WINS Smarting from a record-breaking loss, American Samoa's soccer team braces for another try at the World Cup qualifying matches, this time with a new, curmudgeonly coach (Michael Fassbender). Taika Waititi directed. The team's story was also told in a documentary with the same title. (Nov. 17 in theaters)
THANKSGIVING Sixteen years is a long time from trailer to release. But the tongue-in-cheek coming attraction that Eli Roth made for the midpoint of "Grindhouse" (2007) is now a feature film in its own right. Patrick Dempsey stars. (Nov. 17 in theaters)
TROLLS BAND TOGETHER The Troll universe expands again as Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) seek out Branch's brothers, with whom he previously formed a boy band. That the siblings are not voiced by Timberlake's former 'N Sync mates seems like a missed opportunity. (Nov. 17 in theaters)
THE BOY AND THE HERON Ten years after "The Wind Rises," which had been billed as a final feature, the master animator Hayao Miyazaki gives us this story of a boy who moves from Tokyo after his mother's death during World War II. An enigmatic tower that stands near his new home becomes a gateway to a parallel world -- a quintessentially Miyazakian realm. (Nov. 22 in theaters)
MAESTRO In the director's chair again after "A Star Is Born" (2018), Bradley Cooper also stars as the legendary conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein. Carey Mulligan plays the actress Felicia Montealegre Bernstein, his wife for nearly three decades until her death. (Nov. 22 in theaters, Dec. 20 on Netflix)
MENUS-PLAISIRS -- LES TROISGROS After more than 40 features, the 93-year-old Frederick Wiseman is still going strong. You could probably bake a pretty good cassoulet in the four hours it takes to watch his latest documentary, which observes the workings of a three-Michelin-star restaurant in Roanne, France, from farm to table and beyond. (Nov. 22 in theaters)
NAPOLEON Stanley Kubrick's Bonaparte biography will, alas, always be one of cinema's great what-ifs. But we are getting Ridley Scott's version of the life of the French military leader, with Joaquin Phoenix donning the bicorn. Vanessa Kirby also stars. (Nov. 22 in theaters)
WISH Will Ariana DeBose belt out a hit as big as "Let It Go"? Disney's latest animated offering, advertising its affinities with "Frozen," among other movies, casts the "West Side Story" Oscar winner as a heroine who takes on a king with the help of a cosmic force and a goat. Alan Tudyk and Chris Pine lend their voices as well. (Nov. 22 in theaters)
SALTBURN The writer-director Emerald Fennell's first feature behind the camera since "Promising Young Woman" is set at Oxford, where a student played by Barry Keoghan becomes taken with the lifestyle of a classmate (Jacob Elordi). (Nov. 24 in theaters)
December
THE BIKERIDERS A married couple (Jodie Comer and Austin Butler) are part of a motorcycle gang; Tom Hardy plays their leader. The movie, directed by Jeff Nichols ("Loving"), is inspired by a 1968 book by the photographer Danny Lyon. (Dec. 1 in theaters)

Barack and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground Productions is attached. (Dec. 8 on Netflix)
POOR THINGS Alasdair Gray's 1992 novel riffed on the concept of the Frankenstein monster. In this version, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos ("The Favourite"), who usually works from his own absurdist material, Emma Stone plays the revivified creature, and Willem Dafoe her scientist creator. Mark Ruffalo and Ramy Youssef co-star. (Dec. 8 in theaters)
THE ZONE OF INTEREST Loosely based on Martin Amis's 2014 Holocaust novel, the director Jonathan Glazer's first feature since "Under the Skin" a decade ago is an intensely formal exercise that tries to immerse viewers in the perspective of Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel), the commandant of Auschwitz, as he carried on with his life next to the camp. With Sandra Hüller as Höss's wife. (Dec. 8 in theaters)
ANYONE BUT YOU Advance word suggests that this film, starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, is unusually racy by the standards of comedies faintly inspired by "Much Ado About Nothing." Will Gluck directed. (Dec. 15 in theaters)
CHICKEN RUN: DAWN OF THE NUGGET A teaser trailer suggests that the "nugget" in question is a newborn chick -- although the title could also refer to the invention of chicken nuggets, which would make this sequel to "Chicken Run" (2000) more of a horror film than a family feature. Thandiwe Newton, Zachary Levi and Bella Ramsey provide some of the voices. (Dec. 15 on Netflix)
WONKA While "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" and Roald Dahl's book left many questions, how Wonka defeated a chocolate cartel to found his factory was not exactly foremost among them. Will the movie at least explain how Timothée Chalamet, who plays Wonka in this prequel, could grow into Gene Wilder? (Dec. 15 in theaters)

THE IRON CLAW Sean Durkin ("The Nest") directed this dramatization of the real-life Von Erich brothers, who beginning in the 1970s made a name for themselves wrestling and who almost all died young. Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White star. (Dec. 22 in theaters)
MIGRATION A family of ducks -- the Mallards -- do what a lot of American families do: fly south for a winter getaway. Not surprisingly, travel proves to be a hassle. Mike White, a long way from "The White Lotus," wrote the screenplay for this animated feature, which has the voices of Kumail Nanjiani, Elizabeth Banks, Awkwafina and Keegan-Michael Key, among others. (Dec. 22 in theaters)
REBEL MOON -- PART ONE: A CHILD OF FIRE Sofia Boutella bands together misfit warriors to save the galaxy. Untethered from DC Comics characters and the zombies of his "Dawn of the Dead" and "Army of the Dead," this could be the most unfiltered dose of Zack Snyder since "Sucker Punch" (2011). This is the first of two installments, with the next one due in April. (Dec. 22 on Netflix)
THE COLOR PURPLE The Broadway musical version of Alice Walker's novel, which itself was already adapted into a movie by Steven Spielberg in 1985, hits the big screen. The singer Fantasia, a.k.a. Fantasia Barrino, plays Celie, the role Whoopi Goldberg embodied in the original film. With Taraji P. Henson, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo and Halle Bailey. Blitz Bazawule directed. (Dec. 25 in theaters)
FERRARI Michael Mann and the sleek Italian auto brand go way back. (See also "Miami Vice" in its TV and movie versions.) Adam Driver plays the sports car maker Enzo Ferrari in 1957, at a time of personal turmoil, when he bets big on the Mille Miglia race across Italy. Penélope Cruz and Shailene Woodley also star. (Dec. 25 in theaters)
OCCUPIED CITY Working from a book by his wife, the Dutch filmmaker Bianca Stigter, the director Steve McQueen combines documentary footage from present-day Amsterdam with narration that recounts events in the city throughout World War II. "With formal rigor and adamant focus, it maps -- street by street, address by address -- the catastrophe that befell Amsterdam's Jewish population," Manohla Dargis wrote when the film played at Cannes. (Dec. 25 in theaters)

The Stock Play That Began as a Reddit Joke: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The GameStop stock craze of 2021 becomes the basis for an irreverent underdog movie starring Paul Dano.
"Dumb Money," an energetic, ingratiating dramatization of the GameStop stock craze of 2021, presents an interesting challenge for its screenwriters, who have to juggle two forms of jargon in fast-paced dialogue.
That January, amateur traders, encouraged by online posts and videos, wildly drove up the stock price of the video game retailer GameStop, a company that seasoned investors had written off. Hedge funds that were shorting the stock -- in essence, betting that it would fall -- wound up facing huge losses, thanks to an army of ostensible novices.
So what's more difficult to keep comprehensible for an audience: the obfuscatory verbiage of people who speak Wall Street and treat finance as a kind of secret, clubby code, or the mystifying memes of the Reddit and YouTube users, who are shown likening profits to chicken tenders and using the misspelling "HODL" to indicate that they don't want to sell?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Dumb Money," to its credit, keeps nearly everything clear. Based on "The Antisocial Network," a book that the author Ben Mezrich ("Bringing Down the House") turned around in less than eight months, the movie contains more than a hint of David Fincher's "The Social Network," both in its lighting schemes and its efforts to wring suspense from shots of people looking at devices. (The two films share an editor, Kirk Baxter. Also, somewhat oddly, "Dumb Money" counts among its executive producers the real-life twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, "Social Network" characters and the founders of a cryptocurrency exchange. Teddy Schwarzman, son of the Blackstone chief executive Stephen A. Schwarzman, provided financing for the movie.)
The actual director is Craig Gillespie, who treats the material with the same irreverence he brought to "I, Tonya" (2017), his dementedly funny take on the Tonya Harding scandal. The strain shows more than in that film, partly because "Dumb Money" is fundamentally earnest. The movie tells a story in which an assortment of have-not strangers -- led by a former financial educator whose YouTube costume, one character notes, owes something to Luke Wilson's headwear in "The Royal Tenenbaums" -- band together to hold a stock even when cashing out would be unimaginably lucrative for them individually.
Their online forums may be filled with juvenile humor, and their users may not be snappily dressed, but these are people trying to feed their families and pay their debts. There's nothing jaunty about that, try as the movie might to keep things lively with a Cardi B needle drop, TikTok-filled imagery and congressional grillings cleverly edited to make it look as if the actors were interacting with real-life lawmakers. (Some news clips feature the New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin.) Onscreen, the title is cheekily accompanied by an asterisk, to note that the phrase "dumb money" is used by Wall Street to deride dabbling investors.
The sardonic approach -- which already has critics name-checking "The Big Short" -- isn't as fresh as it would have been even a few years ago. The former Wall Street Journal reporters Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo's script surveys a range of people who jumped on the GameStop bandwagon. All of the principal characters, many of them inventions meant to stand in for real-life counterparts, are introduced with text indicating their estimated net worth.
The GameStop cult's accidental leader is Keith Gill (Paul Dano), who has multiple noms de web and a thing for cat memes. After Gill explains online why he thinks GameStop is undervalued, his bullishness inspires others. His adherents, who never meet, include Jenny (America Ferrera), a nurse and single mother in Pittsburgh; Harmony (Talia Ryder) and Riri (Myha'la Herrold), undergraduates in Austin, Texas; and Marcos (Anthony Ramos), who works at a GameStop in Detroit and has to endure the sneering demands of his boss (Dane DeHaan).
"Dumb Money" isn't fully content to wonk out. It can't just be an investment movie; it also has to be a domestic drama. That makes sense to the extent that the story concerns people's livelihoods (Shailene Woodley plays Gill's wife, who supports his YouTubing and sweats through the agonizing decisions about whether to walk with millions). The humanizing efforts are less inspired when "Dumb Money" falls back on sibling-rivalry tropes. Pete Davidson gets a few laughs as Gill's brother, who confuses Warren Buffett with Jimmy Buffett and takes a lax ethic toward his DoorDash gig.
Better, by virtue of being cast against type, are Seth Rogen, mostly in a straight-man role, as the hedge fund chief Gabe Plotkin, whose finances plummet as the GameStoppers' portfolios explode, and Dano, who never condescends to a character he might easily have played as a joke. It's hard not to root for Gill, in his dorky headband, to take down people who have staked vast sums against the stock he loves. Who cares if what the movie itself is selling is played out?

Satirical Film Lampoons Trade Titans: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The film tells the story about the stock market frenzy over the video game retailer GameStop. It was financed and produced by the son of a Wall Street superpower.
"Dumb Money" is the kind of midbudget, formula-busting, thinking-person's movie that isn't supposed to get made anymore, much less receive a wide, studio-backed release in theaters.
It tells the bizarre true story of small investors -- a nurse, college students, a YouTube personality known as Roaring Kitty -- who created a Wall Street frenzy over the troubled video game retailer GameStop during the pandemic. Determined to teach professional investors a lesson, and hopefully get rich in the process, they pushed GameStop shares to a stratospheric level in early 2021, for a time putting the squeeze on sophisticated hedge funds that had bet that GameStop shares would fall.
The $ 30 million film, directed by Craig Gillespie ("Cruella"), contains withering depictions of real-life Wall Street figures like Kenneth C. Griffin, the Citadel titan; Steven A. Cohen, the hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner; and Gabe Plotkin, whose hedge fund lost billions in the squeeze. In one colorful scene, Mr. Cohen, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, sits in a mansion snarfing a club sandwich and snorting with laughter on the phone with Mr. Plotkin, played by Seth Rogen.
"I honestly can't tell if that's you or Romeo," Mr. Plotkin says, referring to Mr. Cohen's pet pig. The camera cuts to the animal. Mr. Cohen gleefully tosses deli meat on the carpet for it to eat.
In a twist that makes "Dumb Money" even more unusual, the film was financed and produced by Teddy Schwarzman, whose father, Stephen A. Schwarzman, is also a Wall Street superpower and the chief executive of Blackstone, the private equity behemoth that has more than $ 1 trillion under management. Without Teddy Schwarzman's last-minute investment -- he stepped in with financing after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer balked -- "Dumb Money" would not exist, according to Rebecca Angelo and Lauren Schuker Blum, former Wall Street Journal reporters who wrote the screenplay and served as executive producers.
"When no one else believed in this film, Teddy came in pretty heroically," Ms. Blum said.
The "Dumb Money" poster depicts stacks of cash styled to look like an obscene hand gesture, along with the words "Dear Wall Street." What does Mr. Schwarzman's father think about this? Moreover, what do the businessmen caricatured in the film think?
"I'm very, very curious as to what they'll say," said Thomas E. Rothman, chairman of Sony's motion picture group, which will premiere the R-rated "Dumb Money" on Friday at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I know the movie was meticulously researched." (Translation: Sony's lawyers are ready.)
Stephen Schwarzman declined to comment. So did Mr. Griffin and Mr. Cohen. Mr. Plotkin did not respond to queries.
In 2011, Teddy Schwarzman, 44, founded a film company that has since delivered art house hits like "The Imitation Game," which collected $ 234 million worldwide in 2014 and was nominated for eight Oscars. (The movie won for Graham Moore's screenplay.) In an interview, Mr. Schwarzman insisted he had no particular desire to make Wall Street look bad.
"It's never about my thoughts and my feelings," Mr. Schwarzman said of the films he made. "It's about the material: What is this saying and how effective is it in what it's trying to do? Is this a piece of content that can stand out in the genre that it's in and do something novel and do something special?"
"'Dumb Money' is a comedic and thrilling examination of what's going on in our Main Street versus Wall Street world," he added.
Asked if his father or any other Wall Street figure had reached out to him to complain about "Dumb Money," directly or indirectly, Mr. Schwarzman shook his head no.
Sony, which bought distribution rights to "Dumb Money" from Mr. Schwarzman, plans a slow theatrical rollout for the film starting next Friday. Sony expects "Dumb Money" to play on at least 2,500 screens in the United States and Canada by Sept. 29. A release of that size typically requires a marketing campaign costing more than $ 20 million. (Sony declined to say how much it will spend.)
It's a big gamble. "The Big Short," the 2015 film about the greedy architects of the 2008 financial crisis, rode five Oscar nominations to $ 133 million in global ticket sales. (It cost about $ 28 million to make.) Since then, however, in part because of the pandemic, audiences have grown accustomed to streaming these kinds of films at home, leaving theaters to play mostly big-budget franchise spectacles.
"Originality works in theaters when it has cultural urgency, and there's a tremendous amount in this story that speaks to the particular cultural moment that we're in -- the explosion of discontent," Mr. Rothman, the Sony executive, said.
The cast includes Paul Dano, America Ferrera, Pete Davidson, Anthony Ramos and Shailene Woodley. Normally, a cast like this would translate into promotional appearances in settings like "Saturday Night Live," talk shows and social media platforms.
But Hollywood actors are on strike. Their union has banned publicity efforts for virtually all completed films until the stalemate is resolved, and no talks have been scheduled. (Writers are also on strike, with no end in sight. It is not lost on the screenwriters that "Dumb Money," about a populist uprising, is coming out when they have been walking picket lines.)
Familiarity with the GameStop investing saga or even the basics of high finance is not a prerequisite for watching "Dumb Money." The movie unfolds as a relatively simple David-and-Goliath story -- set to a sometimes profane hip-hop and rock soundtrack, with actual Reddit threads, TikTok memes and TV news footage occasionally peppering the screen in unconventional ways.
"To quote the great Billy Friedkin, we wanted the movie to feel like a bat out of hell," said Ms. Angelo, the co-writer, referring to the famed director, who died last month.
Mr. Gillespie, the director, is known for quirky, comedic films ("Lars and the Real Girl," 2007) with exuberant pacing ("I, Tonya," 2017) that sometimes teeter toward mockumentary. "Dumb Money" was a unique challenge, he said, because the story is told through a large number of characters, many of whom have lives that never intersect.
"We have 12 different characters plus a complicated backdrop," he said. "The priority was always to strip it back and get to the core of the emotion, which is this frustration and outright outrage at the disparity of wealth that's going on in this country."
The GameStop surge was driven, in part, by boredom. Working at home or being unemployed during the pandemic, neophyte investors opened brokerage accounts and got caught up in endless online hype around certain stocks.
Mr. Gillespie's son Miles was one of the them. "He made like 50 times his investment," Mr. Gillespie said of his son's GameStop bet. "He actually timed it perfectly."
Excited, Mr. Gillespie then put money into the company -- just in time for the stock to crash. "My timing was perfectly wrong," he said. Mr. Gillespie declined to say how much he lost. "The point is that I was emotionally invested in this story," he said.
"Dumb Money" got its start in January 2021 when the producer Aaron Ryder ("Arrival") was twiddling his thumbs during a 14-day pandemic quarantine in Canada. He had come across conversations on Reddit about GameStop, and then his phone rang. It was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was owned by Anchorage Capital, a New York investment firm led by Kevin Ulrich. Mr. Ulrich also served as MGM's chairman.
"He thought the GameStop story would make a cool movie," Mr. Ryder recalled.
Mr. Ryder sprang into action. Through a contact, he had heard that Ben Mezrich, who wrote the Facebook origin book that served as source material for the film "The Social Network," was working on a book proposal about the GameStop phenomenon.
"I kind of just begged and pleaded and maybe lied a little bit to try to get a hold of this thing," Mr. Ryder said. He succeeded, and started to put together a creative team, including Ms. Angelo and Ms. Blum, who ultimately based their screenplay on Mr. Mezrich's book "The Antisocial Network: The GameStop Short Squeeze and the Ragtag Group of Amateur Traders That Brought Wall Street to Its Knees."
In spring 2021, however, Anchorage sold MGM to Amazon, and "Dumb Money" was suddenly in limbo. "The project ended up being a bit of an orphan that nobody wanted to own," Mr. Schwarzman said.
At the time, "Dumb Money" was expected to cost as much as $ 40 million to make. Mr. Ryder and Mr. Schwarzman whittled down the budget and secured tax rebates from New Jersey, where much of the 31-day shoot would take place.
Mr. Schwarzman then sold certain distribution rights to Sony for an estimated $ 16 million. His company, Black Bear, sold additional rights to overseas distributors, putting the film on solid financial ground before it even arrives in theaters.
The irony is that Mr. Schwarzman is what Hollywood has long called "dumb money," an affluent, often gullible outsider bitten by the movie bug. But he may get the last laugh. As he told The Wall Street Journal in 2013, for an article about Hollywood-bound heirs to family fortunes, "The idea is for dumb money to be smarter."

For Mattel, Success of 'Barbie' Goes Far Beyond the Big Screen: [National Desk]

Full text: The company's approach has paid off to a degree that even the C.E.O. could hardly have believed possible.
When Ynon Kreiz arrived at Mattel in April 2018, the newly installed chief executive had one mantra when it came to a feature film starring Barbie, a project he really wanted to get off the ground: He didn't care if the movie sold a single additional doll.
But "Barbie" the film had to be good and a cultural event. It had to be different. It had to break molds.
And if that meant turning the chief executive of Mattel -- i.e., himself -- into the object of comic ridicule in the portrayal of the chief executive character in the film ("vain and foolish to the nth degree," as The Guardian put it), then so be it.
That approach has paid off to a degree that even Mr. Kreiz could hardly have believed possible. "Barbie" is close to grossing $ 1.4 billion and passed one of the "Harry Potter" movies as the top-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time. It could end up near the $ 2 billion mark. (The record-holder is 2009's "Avatar," at $ 2.9 billion.)
How Mattel pulled off a feat that had eluded the company for years was the subject of recent interviews with Mr. Kreiz; Robbie Brenner, Mattel's executive producer of films; spokespeople for Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig, the film's star and its writer-director; and others familiar with the doll's sometimes tortuous path to the big screen.
Mattel and Warner have jealously guarded their financial arrangements. But people with knowledge of their agreement said Mattel earned 5 percent of the box office revenue, as well as a percentage of eventual profits as a producer of the movie and additional payments as owner of the Barbie intellectual property rights. At $ 2 billion in box office revenue, that amounts to $ 100 million. In addition, there are sales of merchandise connected to the movie as well as an expected boost in sales of dolls.
Representatives for Mattel and Warner declined to comment on the financial arrangements, though the company's chief financial officer said at a conference on Thursday that the company would make about $ 125 million in total billings from the film.
Even though Barbie results weren't reflected in Mattel's latest earnings, released July 26, all anyone wanted to talk about at the earnings call was "Barbie." Mr. Kreiz hailed the film as a "milestone moment" in the company's strategy to "capture the value of its I.P." and demonstrate its ability to attract and team up with top creative talent -- a cornerstone of its ambitious slate of more toy-themed movies.
After the first "Barbie" trailer -- showing a hyper-blond, Day-Glo-clad Ms. Robbie and Ryan Gosling skating along Venice Beach -- went viral in December, anticipation started building. Mattel stock has been on a tear. It has gained 33 percent, from $ 16.24 on Dec. 19 to this week's $ 21.55. The S&P 500 rose 16 percent over the same period.
Wall Street has been reluctant to give much credit to one hit, on the theory that such success is hard to replicate. ("Barbie" has had no discernible impact on Warner Bros. Discovery's stock price.)
But for Mattel, the positive impact of "Barbie" goes far beyond just one film. The company's yearslong strategy to become a major film producer, using its vast storehouse of toys as intellectual property, had been met in Hollywood with skepticism, if not outright mockery. A-list talent wasn't lining up to direct a plush purple dinosaur like Barney. But now the perception that Mattel's leadership is willing to trust and support an unorthodox creative team that delivered both a box office bonanza and a possible awards contender has radically altered that.
And Mattel's surprising willingness to make fun of itself was one of the elements that mostly delighted critics and added to the buzz that roped in many more moviegoers than the "Barbie" fan base.
That Mr. Kreiz was willing to laugh at his own caricature came as something as a surprise to some acquaintances and former colleagues. An Israeli military veteran with dual Israeli and British citizenship, a former professional wind surfer, an avid kite surfer and a fitness buff, with more than a passing resemblance to a younger Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 58-year-old Mr. Kreiz comes across as more of a square-jawed G.I. Joe action hero than a Barbie fan with a sense of humor.
Mr. Kreiz's entire career was in media and entertainment, not retail. His longtime mentor, the Power Rangers entrepreneur and billionaire Haim Saban, hired him fresh out of the University of California, Los Angeles, to launch Fox Kids Europe, a joint venture with Fox. He later ran Maker Studios, a YouTube aggregator, which Disney acquired in 2014. Mr. Kreiz left in 2016, and Maker was folded into the Disney Digital Network in 2017.
That "Barbie" even got made was no small feat. It had languished at Sony for years, with Mattel routinely renewing the option, as various writers struggled to adapt the doll for the big screen. Although one of the most popular toys ever, Barbie was the subject of intense controversy, seen both as a symbol of female empowerment and as an impossible standard of beauty and femininity. The only feasible approach seemed a parody. The comedian Amy Schumer was once slated for the part. But scripts came and went.
Weeks after becoming chief executive in 2018, Mr. Kreiz refused to renew the Sony option, according to multiple people interviewed for this article. He called Ms. Robbie's agent and asked for a meeting. Ms. Robbie was among the most sought-after young actresses in Hollywood, fresh from acclaimed performances in diverse roles -- as the ill-fated ice skater Tonya Harding in "I, Tonya"; in Martin Scorsese's "The Wolf of Wall Street"; and as a fixture in Warner's DC Comics universe as Harley Quinn, the Joker's former girlfriend. And while no human could replicate Barbie's exaggerated dimensions, Ms. Robbie came reasonably close, while also radiating wholesome beauty.
Ms. Robbie was simultaneously reaching out to Mattel and Mr. Kreiz after learning that the "Barbie" option hadn't been renewed. She was looking for a potential franchise to take to Warner, where her production company, LuckyChap, had a first-look deal. But she wasn't looking to star in the film herself.
Over breakfast at the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel, the plush entertainment and celebrity hangout not far from Mattel's less glamorous El Segundo headquarters, Mr. Kreiz shared his vision: He didn't want to make movies in order just to sell toys. He wanted something fresh, unconventional, bold.
"Our vision for Barbie was someone with a strong voice, a clear message, with cultural resonance that would make a societal impact," he said, recalling his message.
Mr. Kreiz's obvious enthusiasm and determination, and his pitch for creative integrity make him hard to resist, as Ms. Brenner, a producer, discovered when he recruited her to run the newly created Mattel film division during another meal at the Polo Lounge. Ms. Brenner, a respected producer and an Academy Award nominee for "Dallas Buyers Club," was attracted to his idea for the movie. In Mr. Kreiz's vision, Mattel would be as much a movie company as a toy company. The two bonded after he asked her who should play Barbie, and she, too, volunteered Ms. Robbie.
At their first meeting, Ms. Robbie suggested Ms. Gerwig for the director. The two were friends and had talked about working together. Mr. Kreiz loved the idea in part because it was so unexpected -- Ms. Gerwig had directed and written acclaimed but offbeat independent films like "Frances Ha," "Lady Bird" and a new take on the classic "Little Women," but no big-budget fare.
"Lady Bird" was one of Ms. Brenner's favorite movies. But would Ms. Gerwig consider such a mass-market, commercial proposal?
Ms. Gerwig, it turned out, had played with Barbie dolls and loved them. She even had old photos of herself playing with Barbie. Ms. Brenner met with Ms. Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, also an acclaimed screenwriter and director, at an editing facility in New York. They kicked around a few ideas, but nothing concrete emerged. Anything seemed possible.
A deal was struck, and Warner signed on as co-producer. Once Ms. Gerwig was on board, Ms. Robbie agreed to star.
At which point Ms. Gerwig and Mr. Baumbach retreated. "I know it's not conventional and not what you're used to, but we have to go into a room for a few months. That's how we work and want to do it," as Ms. Gerwig put it, Mr. Kreiz recalled.
When the script did land in Ms. Brenner's email, it was 147 pages -- the length of a Quentin Tarantino film, epic by Hollywood standards. She closed her office door and started reading. "It was like going on this crazy ride," she recalled. It broke rules, including the so-called fourth wall, addressing the audience directly. It poked fun at Mattel.
New to the company, Ms. Brenner didn't know if this would prove too much for Mattel executives. But she believed it was a great script.
Ms. Brenner's first call was to Mr. Kreiz. "I've read a lot of scripts, and this is so different," she told him. "It's special. You don't get this feeling many times in an entire career."
Mr. Kreiz read the script twice, back to back. "It was deep, provoking, unconventional and imaginative," he said. "It was everything I was hoping it would be."
Ms. Brenner was pleasantly surprised. "Ynon is a very confident person," she said. "He can laugh at himself."
At one point Mr. Kreiz flew to London, where "Barbie" sets were being built at Warner's studio outside the city. He and Ms. Gerwig spent a half-hour discussing the perfect shade of pink.
Mr. Kreiz and Ms. Brenner knew they had a potential hit. "It was our secret that we couldn't talk about," Ms. Brenner recalled.
The original budget target of $ 80 million jumped above $ 120 million once Ms. Gerwig was signed. But even that wouldn't realize the director's full vision for the film. For Warner executives it was a struggle to find what are known as "comps," similar films that had grossed enough to justify such an outlay.
Would "Barbie" be another "Charlie's Angels" from 2019 -- which was budgeted at $ 55 million but grossed only $ 73 million and, after marketing costs, lost money? Or another "Wonder Woman" from 2017, budgeted at over $ 100 million, with a worldwide gross of $ 822 million?
Eventually the budget hit $ 141 million and, with some reshoots, ultimately topped $ 150 million.
On opening night, July 21, Mr. Kreiz took his 19-year-old daughter to the Regal cinema complex at Union Square in Manhattan. As they neared the theater, droves of moviegoers -- and not just young girls -- were heading to it in pink outfits. Five screenings were in progress. All were sold out.
Mr. Kreiz and his daughter dropped in and out to gauge audience reactions. People laughed, applauded and in a few cases shed tears.
Of course the success of "Barbie" has drastically raised the bar -- and expectations -- for Mattel's movies in development, starting with "Masters of the Universe," written and directed by the brothers Adam and Aaron Nee. Twelve more films are in various stages of development, including a "Hot Wheels" produced by J.J. Abrams, also at Warner. Some of these may need to be rethought.
And there will no doubt be "Barbie" sequels, perhaps even a James Bond-like franchise, which would be Mr. Kreiz's ultimate fantasy (although he said it was too soon to discuss any such plans).
Mr. Kreiz acknowledged that in a notoriously fickle and unpredictable business, future success is hardly assured. But "Barbie" has given Mattel momentum -- the beginning of what he calls "a multiyear franchise management strategy."

Full text: From "The Idol" to "Oppenheimer," women's bodies were on display on our screens the past few months. Some executions succeeded with humor, others felt misguided.
This has been a summer of women being liberated -- from their wardrobes, mostly. The nudity on our screens has been a topic of constant conversation for months, from the provoking premiere of "The Idol" in June to the left-field nudity in "Oppenheimer" (and the interpersonal havoc it wreaked on some relationships, as one viral TikTok can attest to). In each instance the theme, in one respect or another, seems to be liberation: not necessarily of the de Beauvoir variety, but a female character's liberation from some kind of enclosure, whether societal, cultural or personal, and her nudity is meant to reflect that.
Depending on the context of the story, the director's intention, the work's perspective or the execution of the shot, a nude scene may serve as shorthand for a character's newfound physical or spiritual freedom, or even an emotional or psychological breakthrough. Or it may be another case of entertainment using a woman's body for shock value. What follows is a spoiler-filled survey of the most gratuitous, unforgettable scenes of nudity this summer -- and an analysis of which ones succeeded in showcasing the female form with reason and intention, as more than just eye candy.
Constant nudity means an unsatisfying night of television.
The setup: On "The Idol," a young pop star named Jocelyn (Lily-Rose Depp), feeling artistically frustrated and in the midst of a nervous breakdown, thrives under the tutelage of a mysterious club owner named Tedros (Abel Tesfaye, a.k.a. The Weeknd) who is fostering a cult of skilled wannabe stars.
The scene: It's tough to pick just one nude scene in this disaster of a television show because Jocelyn is perennially stuck in a state of partial undress. In the first few minutes of the first episode we see Jocelyn in an open silky red robe at a photo shoot, arguing with the intimacy coordinator about her choice to do the shoot with her breasts visible.
By belittling the job of the intimacy coordinator, the scene appears to be less about building Jocelyn as a character than it is about the series planting a flag in the bedraggled land of lurid television. Jocelyn's insistence on doing the shoot without covering up is meant to illustrate that she's a liberated woman, fully in charge of her sexuality, her body, her image. But "The Idol" never figures out what it thinks of its own characters, nor what they want or what to do with them.
One of the prevailing questions about the show among viewers was: Are we meant to think Jocelyn is actually talented? It's unclear whether the show considers its protagonist a true artist or an inept yet deluded peddler of mass-market schlock. Similarly, we don't know how much control Jocelyn actually has. Her submissiveness to Tedros seems to indicate that she's being manipulated. So Jocelyn's daily wardrobe choices -- which don't ever seem to include baggy house clothes for bloated days or cotton pajamas for comfy lounging -- seem to be less about her own self-image and freedom than they are about her being trapped in a 24/7 prison of objectification by her public and those around her.
But the show makes a messy concluding three-point-turn near the end, proposing that perhaps Jocelyn was the evil mastermind after all. Just like the show can't have both its earnest, docile starlet and cunning undercover operator, it can't have a celebrity with both total agency and an obsession with appeasing everyone in their ideas of what she should look like and what she represents as an artist. Either way, with the show's cancellation, it seems Jocelyn's career is forever dead, with no Tedros to revive it.
Fisticuffs in the buff make sexuality besides the point.
The setup: In "No Hard Feelings," Maddie (Jennifer Lawrence), a crude and awkward 30-something with commitment issues who's strapped for cash, responds to an ad from a rich couple seeking a woman to date and deflower their unknowing 19-year-old son, Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman). Maddie's attempts at seducing the neurotic and insecure teenager are repeatedly thwarted in the most ridiculous ways, but in the process Maddie and Percy build a real connection.
The scene: One night, as Maddie and a reluctant Percy go skinny-dipping at the beach, some bullies try to steal their stuff. Maddie steps out of the water in a full-frontal reveal, which then leads to a very NSFW fight sequence.
Here "No Hard Feelings" takes a classic romance trope -- the sexy, impromptu post-date dip -- and wrings out all of the seduction, instead opting for absurd physical comedy. The scene, which includes an impressive crotch punch, succeeds for Lawrence's dedication to this juvenile (and creepy) entry into the "raunchy sex comedy" category of forgettable B-movies.
The camerawork is respectful, matter-of-fact, with no hint of a lingering eye. Lawrence's body is not the point of the scene, but the vehicle of the comedy. Her sexuality is incidental; she pummels the beach interlopers so thoroughly that the violence purposely undermines her attempt to appear desirous to Percy.
Miranda deserves better.
The setup: In the second season of this "Sex and the City" sequel, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) struggles to maintain her frayed relationships with her family while figuring out how she defines her sexual identity.
The scene: Despite the show's revolutionary, daring precursor, "And Just Like That..." can't seem to figure out how to write its characters into a new world of sex, relationships and dating. AJLT also takes a more demure approach to its depictions of sex -- which makes Miranda's two full-frontal nude scenes in Episode 1 especially surprising.
A beloved character that many SATC fans read to be coded gay -- as did Nixon herself, who has been outspoken about her own coming out journey -- Miranda discovers a new dimension to her sexuality once she meets Che (Sara Ramirez), a queer nonbinary comedian. In the first nude scene, part of a season-opening sex montage, Miranda is the only one of the cast members who is exposed, shown nude from the belly up in a pool with Che. At first the montage seems to place the queer romance on equal terms with the cis heterosexual ones, but the moment of nudity does seem as though "And Just Like That..." is calling special, almost self-congratulatory, attention to Miranda and Che.
But Miranda struggles to adjust to a new relationship, a new sexuality and a new lifestyle, exemplified by the second scene, where Miranda tries Che's sensory deprivation tank. Unable to relax, Miranda panics and stumbles her way out of the tank, floundering in the nude. It's a depiction of the fish-out-of-water metaphor that extends to another scene in the episode that shows her in the bedroom with Che struggling to use a sex toy. Here Miranda serves as a comic aside.
Miranda's arc has been the least forgiving in the series, given how her journey of self-discovery comes at the cost of her relationships and, in these nude scenes and others, her dignity. Miranda's nascent sexual liberation is graphically defined by gaffes and naïveté. For a show that aims to represent women -- and, particularly, middle-aged women, with more diverse bodies and backgrounds and sexual orientations than "SATC" included in its series -- "And Just Like That..." unfortunately uses an older woman's body as a punchline.
A well-placed tattoo can create comedy gold.
The setup: In "Joy Ride" Audrey (Ashley Park), an Asian American lawyer raised by white parents, travels to China for a business trip that, thanks to her friends Lolo (Sherry Cola), Kat (Stephanie Hsu) and Deadeye (Sabrina Wu), transforms into a crazy vacation full of sex, drugs and misadventures. In one such outing Audrey finds herself in the middle of a threesome with two handsome basketball players. In another, a wardrobe malfunction reveals Kat's secret genital tattoo.
The scene: The movie's charm lies largely in its dedication to its tried-but-true girlfriends-gone-wild genre of comedy. So even the formulaic setups and telegraphed emotional resolution are entertaining given how much free rein the characters -- and the actors playing them -- are offered to showcase the film's absurdity. One of the reoccurring themes in the movie is the importance of being true to yourself, and the nude scenes fall perfectly in line with this idea.
Audrey's emotional journey hinges on her unwillingness to find her birth mother and connect with her culture. Her friends mock her for her uptightness and for her unchecked internalized racism -- the knee-jerk trust she shows for a blond white woman over someone who looks like her, her obliviousness to her culture's food and traditions, her infamously poor track record for dating Asian men. So when she sleeps with two attractive Asian athletes, it's her liberating moment, when she can let loose sexually and feel open to embracing -- literally and figuratively -- Asianness.
Likewise, Kat's nude moment -- revealing the giant demon head encompassing her full vulva -- is the punchline to a classic, tidy setup that traces back to the early scenes of the movie, when Audrey lets slip to Lolo that Kat has a genital tattoo. Lolo's vulgar line of questioning and theories about Kat's private art, paired with the reveal that Kat pretends to be a chaste virgin in her relationship with her very Christian fiancé, build up the comedic tension. When her embellished nethers make an appearance, it's a surprise, but not a sexy one. The garish detail of the demon face -- and the pivot to an "internal" view, the camera showing the other three friends peeking into her vagina -- rockets the movie's comedy up to absurd heights without seeming unnecessarily sexualized or exploitative.
One man gets to be brilliant, while a brilliant woman gets to be naked.
The setup: In "Oppenheimer," the eponymous father of the atomic bomb (Cillian Murphy) is seen through the lens of his research, shifting politics and personal affairs -- including a romance with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) -- from his school days to his role as scientific director of the Manhattan Project to his public discrediting in the wake of a 1954 security hearing.
The scene: For all of the ways "Oppenheimer" succeeds as a film, from its cinematography and performances to its storytelling, it also commits a cardinal cinematic sin: not just underusing a great actress like Florence Pugh, but also blatantly objectifying her character in gratuitous nude scenes.
In Pugh's first scene, Jean and Oppenheimer meet and banter, as if to show that she's a worthy intellectual adversary, and therefore a worthy lover for the man-genius. After a meager couple of lines of dialogue Jean is naked, straddling Oppenheimer while instructing him to translate a copy of the "Bhagavad Gita" in his room. "I am become death, the destroyer of worlds," he translates, immediately transforming the scene into a misogynistic trope so often used in stories about male genius. Jean is not a brilliant thinker with daring politics; she's not a character with her own story and agency. She is reduced to a body and a brilliant man's inspiration.
In Pugh's second nude scene, when Tatlock persuades Oppenheimer to take a short leave of the Manhattan Project to spend the night with her in a hotel, she's the stand-in for temptation. Her passion for him, and his ultimate refusal to continue their affair, helps the film craft an image of a man who is desired not just for his brain, but also his body.
But the most unforgivable is Jean's final nude appearance, imagined by Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), during Oppenheimer's hearing. The only new information the scene is meant to convey is Kitty's reaction to the council's line of questioning about Oppenheimer's affair with Jean. But Blunt's acting -- the hardness in her eyes, the clear expression of disdain and embarrassment -- tells us all we need to know about her emotional response. Here the film yet again erases Jean's personhood; she exists almost purely within the imagination of Oppenheimer and that of his wife, who like Jean, is similarly underwritten. She's an underdressed footnote in a story about a smart guy she slept with a few times. What woman would envy that?

On 1,000 Planets, High Expectations: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Starfield almost immediately nudges its players to the edges of the cosmos. In the opening hours of the role-playing video game, it's possible to land your spaceship on Earth's moon or zip 16 light-years from a remote outpost to Alpha Centauri. When you open your map and zoom out from a planet, you can behold its surrounding solar system; zoom out again, and you're scrolling past luminous stars and the mysterious worlds that orbit them.
That sprawling celestial journey within Starfield, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, reveals both the tremendous potential and the monumental challenge of an open-world space adventure. Bethesda has hyped an expansive single-player campaign with 1,000 explorable planets. And expectations around the game, officially releasing on Sept. 6 after a 10-month delay, are nearly as vast.
It's the first new universe in 25 years for Bethesda, known for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. It's also a high-stakes moment for Microsoft, which makes the Xbox and has long faced criticism that it produces fewer hit games than its console rivals, Sony and Nintendo. To compete, Microsoft went on a spending spree, acquiring Bethesda's parent company in 2020 and agreeing to purchase Activision Blizzard in 2022, a $ 69 billion bet that is being challenged by regulators.
Now Bethesda must deliver. Known for letting players navigate competing factions and undertake eccentric quests, the studio hopes Starfield will dazzle those clamoring for engaging encounters with alien life-forms or space mercenaries as well as a sense of boundless exploration.
But creating a game the size of a galaxy is extraordinarily time-consuming and expensive, and several past attempts that shot for the stars failed to stick the landing.
"The biggest challenge you face when building any sci-fi game is the almost limitless imagination as players we have about space and about the universe," said Aaryn Flynn, the chief executive of Inflexion Games and a former general manager of BioWare, which makes the sci-fi Mass Effect series. "Players want that captured in the experience."
Todd Howard, the executive producer of Bethesda, was well aware that Starfield, which is being released for Windows computers and the Xbox Series X and S, would have to be expansive to reflect the allure of space travel.
"All of us, I think, at some point look to the sky and say, 'Man, I wonder what it would be like to blast off and land on the moon?' or 'I wonder what would be beyond that?' or 'What's in that star?' or 'Is there life out there?"' Howard said in an interview, adding: "We needed the scale to have that feeling. We could have made a game where there are four cities and four planets. But that would not have the same feeling of being this explorer."
So Starfield has promised 1,000 searchable planets, about 10 percent of which contain life in addition to quests and valuable raw materials. That scale has caused some concern that the studio responsible for glitchy releases like Skyrim and Fallout 76 is in over its head -- and that some aspects of space will be a black hole of fun.
The game's developers say they are confident they have struck the right balance by using a mix of scientific data and artificial intelligence to generate realistic planets, and then fine-tuning those worlds with human programmers who also craft the quests and the enemies that players will encounter.
"We have artists who hand-built the rocks, partly from scanning real rocks in our world and changing them," Howard said. "And then we have algorithms that create the landscape of a planet and put the rocks and the trees in all the right places."
When players land on a new planet in Starfield, they may encounter a tangle of atlas weed or discover that giant crabs can viciously attack. Those who enjoy hoarding can pick up items as innocuous as a jar of sealant in an abandoned laboratory.
But exactly how the game unfolds will differ for each player. Howard acknowledged that Starfield posed "an incredibly difficult design challenge" -- one his team tried to solve by building a planet content manager that allows certain quests to be placed as players reach the surface. One player might run into a derelict outpost; someone else might hear another spaceship's engine as she wanders. Developers have also tried to ensure that very little will happen in some cases, so that players "get some periods of loneliness," Howard said.
Despite the technological advancements that have made it possible to generate countless planets with ease, more than a dozen gaming executives, analysts and developers said in interviews that studios must be wary of overpromising what they can deliver.
No Man's Sky drew incredible hype when its developers at Hello Games spoke of a procedurally generated universe of no fewer than 18 quintillion planets. But when the game made its debut in 2016, players found its worlds uninteresting and its alien dinosaurs crude. The criticism was so harsh that one of the company's founders said he received death threats; the independent studio was investigated for false advertising and eventually cleared.
"Procedural generation can generate new maps but not compelling gameplay," said Elena Bertozzi, a professor of game design and development at Quinnipiac University. "No Man's Sky had a lot of planets with nothing interesting going on."
A spokesman for Hello Games declined to comment, referring to public remarks that one of its founders, Sean Murray, made in 2019. By then, the game had improved and was being praised for its successful postrelease updates.
"Innovation is in such short supply in the industry, and we need it so badly," Murray said at the time. "We need to encourage it, we need to foster it. We need to ask people to shoot for the moon. And if they fail on their first attempt, we need to be there to support them."
The team behind Mass Effect: Andromeda, the fourth installment in the role-playing series, also planned to leverage procedural generation, said Mac Walters, who worked for BioWare for almost two decades as a writer, producer and director and joined the Andromeda project partway through.
"There was this vision that we were going to have a thousand planets," Walters said, confirming some details of an investigation into what the gaming news site Kotaku called a "turbulent and troubled" development. When Andromeda was released in 2017, there were about a half-dozen planets to explore.
BioWare did not respond to a request for comment. Flynn, the studio's former general manager, said the team was hamstrung by decisions such as the choice to use the Frostbite game engine, which was not intended for content-heavy role-playing games. He said the team had hoped to have enough sophistication in its algorithms to make the procedurally generated worlds "indistinguishable" from what developers were making, so that they could focus on building a transporting narrative.
"We didn't get there," he said. "And so our developers still had to come over and work on the procedural content a fair bit."
When players finally got their hands on the game, many were shocked by its lack of polish. The characters' facial animations were so clumsy, they became fodder for internet memes. Critics assailed what they described as cheesy dialogue, subpar voice acting and major plot problems.
Avoiding similar pitfalls with Starfield is paramount for Microsoft, which desperately needs a new blockbuster game as its flagship franchise, Halo, fades in relevance. Some time after Bethesda announced an open-world space game in 2018, Microsoft executives learned that Sony was considering a deal to make it available exclusively on PlayStation consoles.
"When we heard that Starfield was going to potentially end up skipping Xbox -- we can't be in a position as a third-place console where we fall further behind on console ownership," Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, testified during a court hearing in June that focused on the Activision acquisition. "We had to secure content to remain viable."
Microsoft shelled out $ 7.5 billion for ZeniMax Media, the parent company of a swath of game studios that included Bethesda, but is still looking for a return on investment. Redfall, the most prominent Xbox game resulting from the deal so far, flopped when it was released in May.
Xbox owners have also been denied a seat at this year's feast of role-playing games, including Final Fantasy XVI, which is currently available only on the PlayStation 5, and Tears of the Kingdom, a Zelda game for the Switch. Baldur's Gate 3, which has been rapturously received by computer gamers, hits the PlayStation 5 on Wednesday; an Xbox version is due later this year.
Microsoft has pioneered a shift in gaming away from $ 60 or $ 70 retail purchases and toward a Netflix-style subscription service that offers hundreds of games for between $ 10 and $ 17 per month. That service, Game Pass, had more than 25 million subscribers last year but needs a steady supply of marquee games to make it a can't-miss subscription.
If Starfield wins over players, "it becomes a crowning jewel in that portfolio," said Yung Kim, the head of partnerships at the gaming data firm Aldora and a former analyst for Piper Sandler.
Spencer said he would measure Starfield's success simply by how many people play it, regardless of how they do so. "Everything comes from that. How many people are playing across devices?" he wrote in an email. "I want Starfield to be Bethesda Game Studios' most played game ever."
Starfield draws inspiration from movies and television shows like "Interstellar," "Battlestar Galactica" and "The Martian," Howard said, but also from real organizations like NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX. The game's main story focuses on collecting mysterious alien artifacts and can be completed in about 30 hours. But players can spend hundreds more customizing spaceships, harvesting resources, exploring planets and fighting bloodthirsty pirates.
Focusing on realism helped ground the project, Bethesda executives said. Engineers toured NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which Ashley Cheng, Bethesda's managing director, said helped inspire Starfield's realistic simulation of the galaxy -- down to how quickly a planet rotates around its axis. The trip also helped set parameters on Starfield's procedural generation of planets to ensure that their geography was realistic.
All of the names, locations and characteristics of Starfield planets are the same for every player. Some are temperate, made of rock and filled with fauna and flora. Others are gas giants in a deep freeze that cannot be landed on. Still others have chemical water, low gravity or a surface so hot it emits scalding vapor fog. (Earth, in 2330, is essentially a desert filled with corrosive gas.)
"They all have different biomes," Angela Browder, Bethesda's studio director, said. "We all have this idea of what space is supposed to be like. Whatever you thought it was going to look like, we probably have a planet that matches up."
Browder said developers also had to weigh realism against enjoyment. Survival in space needed to be challenging, but not too burdensome. The team ditched the idea of making players refuel their spaceships, and tried to make the controls for piloting them accessible.
Their desire for accuracy also kept expectations in check. Cheng said part of the balance was making sure there was enough to do without jam-packing all 1,000 planets with content. Not every location, he said, "is supposed to be Disney World."
"The point of the vastness of space is you should feel small. It should feel overwhelming," Cheng said. "Everyone's concerned that empty planets are going to be boring. But when the astronauts went to the moon, there was nothing there. They certainly weren't bored."

Richard Ekstract, 92, 'Maverick' Magazine Publisher With Link to Warhol: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He was promoting a new trade journal, Tape Recording, when he lent a video recorder to Andy Warhol, who used it to make a classic work with Edie Sedgwick.
Richard Ekstract, a magazine publisher who found success with niche audiences -- from trade journals like Tape Recording and Audio Times to a regional shelter franchise that started with Hamptons Cottages and Gardens -- and played a curious role in Andy Warhol's career, died on Aug. 7 in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 92.
His death, in a hospital, was announced by his son Steven. The cause was cancer.
Mr. Ektract was a media mogul of sorts, having amassed a small fortune creating a cottage industry of some 20 trade and consumer publications, moving from electronics to video to decorating and real estate. But he may be best remembered for an early collaboration with Warhol.
In the summer of 1965, Mr. Ekstract, then a budding trade journal publisher in New York with one title under his belt, Audio Times, lent Warhol, who had been making 16-millimeter films, a prototype of a Norelco "slant-track" video camera. (It was a few months before Nam June Paik, the so-called father of video art, got his first Sony video recorder.)
Mr. Ekstract had met Warhol a few years earlier through an art director and, knowing Warhol's frugality, would often lend him equipment.
The clunky white Norelco was a one-off, expensive and difficult to use, but Warhol played with it for a month, creating a landmark work, the affecting "Outer and Inner Space." The film, in a split-screen format, starred the magnetic, doomed Edie Sedgwick delivering dueling monologues: Perched on a stool, she opines on this and that as a video of her opining on this and that, but less clearly, plays next to her.
J. Hoberman, writing in The New York Times, called the film "a masterpiece of video art made before the term even existed."
In exchange for the use of the video camera, Warhol gave Mr. Ekstract a collection of acetates he had used the year before to make a series of red silk-screened self-portraits. With Warhol's permission, Mr. Ekstract took them to a commercial printer, who made a second set of self-portraits, following Warhol's directions given over the phone.
As part of the deal, one of the portraits would appear in Mr. Ekstract's new magazine, Tape Recording. To celebrate the magazine's debut, Mr. Ekstract, with characteristic flair, threw a party on abandoned rail tracks underneath the Waldorf Astoria hotel. The portraits were exhibited -- and given away to a few of the magazine's sponsors -- and "Inner and Outer Space" was screened.
The red self-portraits had a complicated afterlife. One of them had been bought by a filmmaker named Joe Simon-Whelan in 1989 and became the subject of a long and bitter lawsuit. Despite ample documentation about its origins, when Mr. Simon-Whelan asked to have the work authenticated by the Warhol Foundation, his request was denied multiple times. He sued, and in 2010, after the foundation had spent $ 7 million in legal fees, Mr. Simon-Whelan gave up, having run out of money to continue.
Mr. Ekstract kept one of the red portraits for himself. Last year, he offered it to an auction house in Arizona, but the piece failed to sell.
Richard Evan Ekstract was born on Feb. 20, 1931, in Brooklyn to Max and Mildred (Last) Ekstract. His father was in the apparel business; his mother was a homemaker. Richard grew up in Philadelphia and studied journalism at Temple University. He joined the Army in 1952 as a lieutenant and served at Fort Benning, Ga., where he became the editor of Infantry magazine.
Mr. Ekstract's first magazine of his own was Audio Times, a weekly trade journal. By the end of its first year it had no revenue to speak of, until Avery Fisher, the audio electronics pioneer and philanthropist, signed on as its first advertiser.
Mr. Ekstract's last publishing venture was the Cottages and Gardens franchise. Hamptons Cottages and Gardens began as a free biweekly shelter magazine in the summer of 2002 and soon spawned spinoffs: Palm Beach Cottages and Gardens and Connecticut Cottages and Gardens.
The magazines were distinctive for using original photography instead of pickup pictures of interiors and for generally punching above their weight as regional freebies, giving them the look and feel of national magazines. Advertisers responded, and locals -- from old money types to the newly flush -- opened their showplaces to the editors.
"Richard was a maverick in magazine publishing at a level that surprised some people," Newell Turner, the first editor of HC & G, as it was known for short, said in a phone interview. (Mr. Turner went on to be editor of House Beautiful magazine and then editorial director of the Hearst Design Group.) "He got into the shelter magazine world on a local basis when others didn't see much value there. But he realized there was a huge interest in it, particularly in the Hamptons, and he was right.
"Because of the audience -- the creative and business classes of New York City -- the magazine had a huge power," he continued. "He saw the importance of micro-audiences, and he was revolutionary in that he believed a free magazine could still be worth someone picking it up and reading it."
Mr. Ekstract's tastes were eclectic. He was opinionated, strong willed and colorful in his language. He was notorious for hiring and firing, running through 10 publishers in the first five years of HC & G.
In addition to magazines, "Richard collected art and architecture," said Alexander Gorlin, who designed a Tuscan villa for Mr. Ekstract on the site of a former estate in East Hampton, one of a number of houses he built and flipped on the East End of Long Island. "But everything was for sale."
He is survived by his wife, Eileen, whom he married in 1990; his daughter, Janet; his sons Steven and Michael; and four grandchildren. His marriage to Claudia Tucker ended in divorce
In the spring of 2008, as the recession deepened, Mr. Ekstract put his Cottages and Gardens franchise on the market. A year and a half later, it was bought by Marianne Howatson, a veteran magazine publisher, for an undisclosed sum.
But Mr. Ekstract, with typical brio, told The New York Post that the downturn was not the reason for the sale.
"I'm 77," he said. "It's enough already. I have nothing left to prove."

Studios' Labor Negotiator, Usually Coy, Has Lead Role: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Carol Lombardini, the studio voice in union talks, values a low profile. That hasn't kept striking writers and actors from casting her as a villain.
As the Hollywood union strikes have dragged on, key characters have taken turns in the spotlight.
There is Fran Drescher, the comedic actress who, with surprising ferocity, has rallied the actors' union against television and film companies, and enraged studio executives in the process. Robert A. Iger, who leads Disney, publicly pushed back against the striking workers, and found himself jeered on picket lines as a robber baron.
But one crucial participant has remained an enigma: Carol Lombardini, 68, the top union negotiator for studios and a 41-year veteran of Hollywood labor battles.
For someone who sits at the center of two increasingly bitter strikes -- writers walked off the job on May 2, followed by actors on July 14 -- very little is known about her. Ms. Lombardini has not given an interview of more than a few words since 2009, when she ascended from the No. 2 job to become president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that bargains on behalf of the eight largest entertainment companies.
Until now, her tenure had been marked by labor peace. Studios reached an agreement with the directors' union in June; the writers last struck in 2008, the actors in 1980. Over the years, she has told colleagues that cultivating a public persona would only undercut her effectiveness at the bargaining table. Or at least it would not help. She declined to comment for this article.
Wanted or not, the spotlight has found her. Many union members blame her for the negotiating logjam that has brought almost all movie and television production in Hollywood to a halt. Partly because of her woman-of-mystery persona and partly because she's an easy target, Ms. Lombardini has become an avatar for the grievances of tens of thousands of striking workers. "Carol can go kick rocks," Caroline Renard, a striking writer, said this month on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
With her public personality absent, actors and writers have invented one. In May, someone started a parody account on X that has portrayed Ms. Lombardini as a crass tyrant declaring, "I'm a goddess of chaos!" (Yes, she has seen it, an associate said. No, she is not amused.)
Another group of screenwriters have mocked Ms. Lombardini online as a fuddy-duddy who hangs out at chain restaurants, the taunt being that no Hollywood person would be caught dead in one. (Her office is near a Cheesecake Factory in suburban Los Angeles.)
Other union members seem to have simply grown curious about the Oz-like negotiator behind the curtain. "Will we ever find out what Carol Lombardini is in the flesh?!" Maridia Minor, a writer, asked on X last week.
A few facts are known about Ms. Lombardini. She is a devoted baseball fan. She grew up in a working-class town outside Boston. And of course, she has enormous power. Ms. Lombardini is responsible for negotiating all 58 of Hollywood's union agreements, from contracts with the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, as the actors' union is known, to ones with the American Federation of Musicians and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. How she handles herself -- union officials who have negotiated with her describe her as blunt yet cordial -- can make the difference between smooth talks and a strike.
Jeff Ruthizer, who spent 40 years as a labor negotiator at Disney, ABC and NBC and recently wrote a book, "Labor Pains," drawing on that experience, called Ms. Lombardini "a funny person" who "knows how to read a room and is tough when she needs to be."
At the end of the day, however, Ms. Lombardini is an employee, albeit one whose duties require deft ego management. She answers to moguls like Mr. Iger of Disney and Ted Sarandos of Netflix, who are not used to managing by committee. The other alliance members are NBCUniversal, Apple, Warner Bros. Discovery, Amazon, Paramount Global and Sony Pictures. Ms. Lombardini advises them on a course of action, but they ultimately decide on a strategy and then she does their bidding.
In late July, for instance, some company leaders pressed Ms. Lombardini to reopen negotiations with the Writers Guild. (The two sides had not met since early May.) While not adamantly opposed, Ms. Lombardini expressed skepticism; she was not convinced that the Writers Guild was ready to soften its stance, according to two studio chiefs and one studio labor lawyer involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Ultimately, the companies directed her to re-engage with the writers.
The subsequent talks have gone poorly, with the Writers Guild holding firm to demands related to staffing minimums in television writers' rooms and transparency into streaming-service viewership, among others. Frustrated, studio leaders told Ms. Lombardini on Tuesday to release the details of their sweetened proposal -- which included higher wages, a pledge to share some viewership data and additional protections around the use of artificial intelligence -- to the news media. It was essentially a strategy to go around the guild's negotiating committee and appeal to rank-and-file members.
In a message to its 11,500 members on Thursday, the Writers Guild said it was "undeterred by this latest tactic."
The Writers Guild declined to discuss Ms. Lombardini. Other unions did the same. (SAG-AFTRA, whose contract covers tens of thousands of movie and television actors, has not returned to the bargaining table in more than six weeks.) It appears, however, that union leaders have a grudging respect for her.
"She's been around a long time, and she knows what she's doing, and she commands a lot of respect as well," Lindsay Dougherty, the lead Teamsters organizer in Hollywood, said in an interview with an entertainment trade news publication last year.
"I think she's a fair individual," Ms. Dougherty added. (Teamsters represent drivers, casting directors and animal handlers, among other Hollywood specialties.)
Ms. Lombardini, an avid Red Sox and Dodgers fan, had a working-class upbringing in Framingham, Mass., and was inspired to become a lawyer by reading articles about F. Lee Bailey, according to an associate. After getting a bachelor's degree in Renaissance history from the University of Chicago and a law degree from Stanford, she started her career at law firms in Los Angeles, specializing in labor by happenstance after one firm moved her from its quiet trusts and estates department to its bustling labor one.
She has worked at the studio alliance since its creation in 1982 and is married to William Cole, a prominent labor lawyer whose clients have often included studios.
"Carol has one of the most complicated jobs in Hollywood -- and it's growing even more so -- but I think she clearly understands and appreciates the challenge," said Barry M. Meyer, a former Warner Bros. chairman who worked closely with Ms. Lombardini. "It's actually been an integral part of her life's work."
By all accounts, Ms. Lombardini knows various union contracts cold, which is no small feat; the most recent Writers Guild contract ran 740 pages. Ms. Lombardini is not a zealot in the negotiating room, according to union officials who have sat across the table from her, but she can be brusque and unyielding. In a letter to its members this month, the Writers Guild said Ms. Lombardini would not engage on certain topics. "Carol's response -- something she repeated three times during the meeting: 'People just want to get back to work."'
In the past, studio leaders have prized her efficiency. "Carol has done a very good job this past year," Kevin Tsujihara, who was the Warner Bros. chairman, wrote in a 2014 email that was made public as part of the Sony Pictures hack, noting that she had recently concluded six negotiations.
"There was no public drama and all were concluded within parameters we had established," Mr. Tsujihara wrote. He recommended a bonus of $ 365,000, or 30 percent of her salary, which he listed as $ 1.2 million.
The job has become much more difficult. For a start, the studio alliance's relatively recent additions of Apple, Netflix and Amazon have made its priorities more varied and unwieldy than in the past. The unions have grown more aggressive. And bargaining issues -- the rise of artificial intelligence, for instance, and its potential to disrupt the creative process -- have become more complex.
"She has to unify the various views of the studios and get everyone to agree," Mr. Ruthizer, the labor lawyer, said. "And then she has the other job of negotiating with the other side of the table."
"The challenge now is greater than she's ever seen," he added. "It's bigger than anybody has ever seen."

As Obscure as an Extra, She Has a Lead Role in Hollywood’s Labor Fight

As the Hollywood union strikes have dragged on, key characters have taken turns in the spotlight.
There is Fran Drescher, a comedic actress who, with surprising ferocity, has rallied the actors union against television and film companies, and enraged studio executives in the process. Bob Iger, who leads The Walt Disney Co., publicly pushed back against the striking workers and found himself jeered on picket lines as a robber baron.
But one crucial participant has remained an enigma: Carol Lombardini, 68, the top union negotiator for studios and a 41-year veteran of Hollywood labor battles.
For someone who sits at the center of two increasingly bitter strikes — writers walked off the job May 2, followed by actors July 14 — very little is known about her. Lombardini has not given an interview of more than a few words since 2009, when she ascended from the No. 2 job to become president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the organization that bargains on behalf of the eight largest entertainment companies.
Until now, her tenure had been marked by labor peace. Studios reached an agreement with the directors union in June; the writers last struck in 2008, the actors in 1980. Over the years, she has told colleagues that cultivating a public persona would only undercut her effectiveness at the bargaining table. Or at least it would not help. She declined to comment for this article.
Wanted or not, the spotlight has found her. Many union members blame her for the negotiating logjam that has brought almost all movie and television production in Hollywood to a halt. Partly because of her woman-of-mystery persona and partly because she’s an easy target, Lombardini has become an avatar for the grievances of tens of thousands of striking workers. “Carol can go kick rocks,” Caroline Renard, a striking writer, said this month on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.
With her public personality absent, actors and writers have invented one. In May, someone started a parody account on X that has portrayed Lombardini as a crass tyrant declaring, “I’m a goddess of chaos!” (Yes, she has seen it, an associate said. No, she is not amused.)

Other union members seem to have simply grown curious about the Wizard of Oz-like negotiator behind the curtain. “Will we ever find out what Carol Lombardini is in the flesh?!,” Maridia Minor, a writer, asked on X last week.

It's Women vs. Men In Campus Comedy: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Atypical star vehicles, ensemble indies, high-powered genre pictures and gripping historical documentaries are among the highlights of this month's offbeat picks.
'Damsels in Distress' (2012)
Stream it on Hulu.
Eleven years ago, the "Barbie" mastermind Greta Gerwig was known not as the director behind a billion-dollar blockbuster, but as one of the most charismatic actresses on the indie film scene. Her talents are nicely showcased in this sharp-witted, frequently quotable comedy of manners and satire of campus life. The writer and director is Whit Stillman, who helped define smart, talky '90s indies with his triple play of "Metropolitan," "Barcelona" and "The Last Days of Disco"; this, his first feature in 13 years, was a welcome return to form. Gerwig is at her complicated best as Violet, who helps her friends (Megalyn Echikunwoke, Carrie MacLemore and Lio Tipton, all memorable) navigate the unfortunate men of the fictional Seven Oaks College; Adam Brody is likably squirrelly as the campus cad.
'The Seagull' (2018)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Gerwig's frequent leading lady Saoirse Ronan is one of the many familiar faces in the ensemble cast of this well-crafted adaptation of Anton Chekhov's theatrical classic. Brian Dennehy, Billy Howle, Elisabeth Moss and Corey Stoll also appear, as residents and visitors of a picturesque country estate outside Moscow, though Annette Bening shines brightest in the showcase role of Irina Arkadina, the comically vain and heartbreakingly complicated diva of the Russian stage. The director Michael Mayer works a bit to hard to jazz up the text with showy camera movements and excessive coverage, but those momentary distractions can't detract from the fine acting on display here.
'Non-Stop' (2014)
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Liam Neeson's third act as a hero of pulpy action pictures has seen its ups ("The Grey") and its downs (the "Taken" sequel of your choosing), but this tightly-wound potboiler is one of the genuine highlights. He stars as Bill Marks, an ex-cop-turned-air-marshal battling a mysterious killer who's bumping off the passengers -- one every twenty minutes -- of an international flight. The director Jaume Collet-Serra takes the right approach to this somewhat silly premise, crafting the picture as a cross between Agatha Christie, "Airport" and "Speed," and the ensemble cast (which includes Michelle Dockery, Scoot McNairy, Julianne Moore, Lupita Nyong'o, Linus Roache and Shea Whigham) helps keep this wild flight on course.
'Drug War' (2013)
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The celebrated Hong Kong action auteur Johnnie To ("Election," "Triad Election," "Breaking News") brought his decades of film craft to bear in this fast-paced, furiously entertaining crime epic. There are characters galore and subplots aplenty (as is To's custom), but the underlying premise is simple: a bad guy (Louis Koo's ruthless drug kingpin), a good guy (Sun Honglei's dedicated undercover cop) and a pursuit. To's breathless set pieces are as relentless as ever, but the picture is about more than mere action; he gives dimension to what could have been cartoon characters, and surveys the human consequences of the titular conflict.
'Bernie' (2012)
Stream it on Hulu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The true story of how a beloved East Texas mortician murdered a wealthy widow could've made for a probing character study (or, perhaps, a tacky Netflix true crime docuseries). Instead, the director and co-writer Richard Linklater achieves a delicate and precise mixture of dark comedy and small-town portraiture, thanks in no small part to a cast that includes Jack Black (Linklater's "School of Rock" star) as the mortician, Matthew McConaughey (Linklater's "Dazed and Confused" star) as the district attorney who prosecutes him and the great Shirley MacLaine as the victim, a characterization she pitches somewhere between Ouiser from "Steel Magnolias" and Beelzebub.
'A Hologram for the King' (2016)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Tom Hanks movies were still an event in 2016, yet few paid much attention to this light yet lofty adaptation of Dave Eggers's novel. Perhaps it was just a bit too odd, too steeped in the hands-off style and indie sensibility of its director Tom Tykwer ("Run Lola Run"), but it's an undiscovered gem of Hanks's late period. He stars as Alan Clay, a recently divorced and undeniably desperate American consultant in Saudi Arabia for what is intended to be a brief sales pitch to the Saudi government. But days pass as he waits for his audience with the Saudi king, resulting in an unexpectedly effective combination of insightful character study and "Waiting for Godot"-inspired absurdism.
'Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story' (2017)
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Few film stars of the 1930s were as shimmeringly seductive as the Viennese vamp first called Hedy Kiesler, and first known for her then-shocking in-the-buff turn in the 1933 Czech import "Ecstasy." But this is no mere tale of Old Hollywood stardom. Lamarr lived an eventful and exciting life, of sin and scandal and, most notably, invention -- particularly her development of a communication system that formed the foundation of modern Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth. She was a woman more dynamic and complex than any of the characters she played, and Alexandra Dean's documentary tells her story with excitement, verve and plentiful (not to mention well-earned) sympathy.
'Radio Unnameable' (2012)
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
For decades, Bob Fass was a comforting voice for nocturnal New Yorkers -- the overnight host on WBAI-FM, an early developer and practitioner of "free-form radio," opening his phone lines and airwaves to an assortment of searching callers and outlaw entertainers. Paul Lovelace and Jessica Wolfson's affectionate documentary tells the story of Fass's show and his life (to the limited extent that they were separate at all), via a riveting collection of archival audio recordings, photographs, films and memories, from his early searching days to the loosely organized and occasionally out-of-control gatherings of what he called his "cabal" of loyal listeners. On Fass's show, insomniacs and night workers and eccentrics found not only a megaphone, but a community; Lovelace and Wolfson's film gently draws the line to contemporary high-tech counterparts, while still longing for the idealism and possibility of the past.

Gran Turismo Drove a Teenager to Prominence: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Yu, Brandon

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The PlayStation video game's realistic cars and racetracks helped Jann Mardenborough find his calling as a professional driver.
Jann Mardenborough can vividly recount the first time he ever played Gran Turismo, the popular racing video game that would completely alter his life.
While seeking refuge on Bonfire Night, a British holiday full of firework celebrations, an 8-year-old Mardenborough stumbled upon the game at his neighbors' house. He selected a violet Mitsubishi 3000GT and began racing on the Autumn Ring track. Mardenborough went on to play the game all night, and then every day after that, showing up at his neighbors' door immediately after school.
"They got so fed up with me turning up at their house, one day the wife came across the street, knocked on our door and had in hand the PlayStation and GT 1, and gave it to my parents," the 31-year-old racecar driver recently recalled during a video interview.
It's the origin story to the other origin story: the true, improbable one depicted in the film "Gran Turismo," which was directed by Neill Blomkamp and opens on Friday. The movie dramatizes Mardenborough's journey, from gaming in his bedroom to winning the 2011 GT Academy -- an annual competition that, from 2008 to 2016, put the game's best players in real vehicles -- to driving formula cars professionally.
The eight main games in the Gran Turismo franchise, which debuted in Europe and North America in 1998, are known for their scrupulously reproduced cars and exacting racing simulations. In the months before he attended GT Academy, Mardenborough upgraded from a plastic PlayStation controller to a homemade wooden racing frame along with a steering wheel and pedal that he bought with money his parents gave him for good grades.
The competition was a godsend for Mardenborough, who was trying to sell car parts on eBay after losing a retail job; he had dropped out of college after realizing that studying motor sport engineering did not mean he could actually drive the cars.
Even so, Mardenborough said he was skeptical of his chances. He had played Gran Turismo no more than an average teenage gamer after his initial fixation, had never competed in a tournament and had barely any experience driving a normal car. The first time he brought his rickety 1991 laser blue BMW E30 onto a highway was on his way to the competition.
Mardenborough's perspective took a visceral turn when he qualified for racing camp -- a stretch depicted in the film that follows the finalists training in actual cars -- and was given his first taste of the track.
"After my first few laps, when I got out the car, I remember thinking, 'I don't want to go through life never experiencing that again,"' said Mardenborough, who served as a producer on "Gran Turismo" and as the stunt double for his own character.
Mardenborough can eagerly describe the technicalities that distinguish game from reality -- the sensation, for instance, of the vibration through the car seat -- but said that much of the real-world feeling and reactions mirrored Gran Turismo.
"When you race against real people," he said, "everything is real."
Mardenborough, who is played by Archie Madekwe in "Gran Turismo," went line by line with Sony over early drafts of the script, which he noted is mostly true to his life. The characters played by David Harbour and Orlando Bloom are both fictionalized but loosely based on real people. And a crash involving Mardenborough in Germany that left a spectator dead really happened, although detractors have complained about how the tragic event was translated to the screen.
In the film, the crash occurs right before Mardenborough returns to the track for a podium finish at Le Mans, the famous endurance race in France -- back-to-back events that form an emotional arc of setback and triumph. In reality, Mardenborough's crash in Germany came two years after that podium finish, leading to criticism that the film's timeline was edited to serve a narratively pat movie ending.
"The order is the order, but those events happened in my life," Mardenborough, who avoided serious injuries, said in response. "This isn't a documentary." He did race in Le Mans one year after the crash, and Mardenborough said the emotional battle the film constructed was consistent with his feelings.
"When you believe the reason why you're put on earth is to race a racing car, and then you're asking yourself, 'Do I still want to do this?"' he said. "It's not a pleasant question to ask."
Mardenborough last competed in May and is talking to teams about potentially racing in the United States next year. And occasionally, the driver who fidgeted with a gaming steering wheel during our interview will still play Gran Turismo.
If he were to race against his 19-year-old self in the game right now, who would win? Mardenborough thought for a moment.
"Me," he said with a competitive smirk. "If I put in the amount of hours I did back then, considering my experience in real life, I would be quicker. But all it is is hours."

Full text: A popular racing video game series gets turned into an underdog sports drama in this big-screen adaptation.
Since the late 1990s, the Gran Turismo racing games for PlayStation have brought in billions of dollars, rivaling the box-office bounties of some movie franchises. It was only a matter of time before a movie offshoot arrived, following in the tracks of other live-action adaptations of PlayStation games, including last year's "Uncharted." "Gran Turismo" the movie tells the true (but unlikely) story of Jann Mardenborough, a Gran Turismo maven who became a professional racer of actual cars on actual tracks.
Mardenborough's leap from pixels to asphalt was an effective advertisement for Gran Turismo as more than a game, but his transition wasn't all smooth. In the director Neill Blomkamp's dutiful telling, Jann (Archie Madekwe), a teenager from Cardiff, Wales, faces doubters and steep learning curves to go with the racetrack curves. His underdog story -- can this digital driver make it in the real world? -- doubles as an old-fashioned tale of a young man proving his worth to his family and other skeptics.
Madekwe's Jann is so unassuming that every step in his journey comes as a pleasant surprise. After Jann's father (Djimon Hounsou) says there's no future in gaming and brings Jann to his job at a rail yard, Jann goes off and wins a contest held by Nissan to recruit promising Gran Turismo players. (His mother, played by Geri Halliwell Horner, is a bit more encouraging.) He earns a spot in the company's racing academy, which is overseen by a hard-nosed engineer, Jack (David Harbour), and an unctuous marketer, Danny (Orlando Bloom). Once again Jann exceeds expectations and beats out a more TV-ready competitor for the chance to race professionally.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The movie begins to resemble the levels in a video game, as Jann enters races worldwide to clinch his contract with Nissan. He finally beats an obnoxious front-runner (Josha Stradowski) in Dubai and celebrates in Tokyo, but he flips his car on his next race (as the real Mardenborough did in 2015, though the film adjusts the chronology). Like many sports movies, there's no shortage of training and competition -- the perpetual buildup. A finale comes at Le Mans, the annual 24-hour race.
Blomkamp's handling of the track scenes lacks a compelling physicality, or (if you'll pardon the term) drive -- the editing and camerawork could each use a sharper sense of rhythm and velocity. That might not matter so much if it were paired with a strong screenplay, but the platitudinous script here lacks flair (though Jann does have the likable quirk of listening to Enya or Kenny G to chill out before races). Madekwe conveys a youthful vulnerability and an appealing air of quiet doggedness, even if he's mild-mannered as a performer here. The movie doesn't need to achieve the same levels of sensation as a wildly popular racing simulator, but it should convey excitement and dynamism in its own cinematic way. When the novelty of watching a gamer become a driver wears off, we're left with an adequate racing drama in a medium built for so much more.

Nothing's Ever Easy For Spidey: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: An amateur tribute with millions of views has set off controversies -- not about copyright, but about racist texts and the point of fan films to begin with.
In 2020, Gavin J. Konop, a high school junior in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., was going through a rough patch in life -- his grades were dipping, and his friendships strained -- so he decided to create a film about his favorite superhero: Spider-Man.
Drawing on various comics, he wanted to tell an emotional story of Spider-Man grappling with personal failure and self-doubt, a tale that would parallel his own problems as a teenager.
This month, Konop's "Spider-Man: Lotus," made for $ 112,000 through crowdfunding, debuted on YouTube after a red-carpet premiere in Los Angeles. It has received about 3.5 million views, but it has also become mired in controversy after screenshots surfaced on social media showing racist texts sent by Konop and the lead actor.
Between the comparatively large budget and the texts controversy, "Lotus" has gone viral, and the resulting attention has caused a rift among makers of Spider-Man fan films. These creators, overwhelmingly young men, have uploaded thousands of videos in which their beloved web-slinger swings through New York City and swoops down on bad guys outside the confines of the official movie franchises.
"When you look up Spider-Man fan films on YouTube and just hit enter, you'll be scrolling for days," said Samuel Flatman, 29, who has made several of the videos.
For years, all it took to make one was a cheap camera and a simple plot. "You just find a small downtown area, go into the alleyway and beat up a couple of your friends. And then you got a Spider-Man movie," said Heath Gleason, a 27-year-old creator from Georgia.
Now, with a relatively monster budget and a cast and crew of more than 150, "Lotus" has redefined what a Spider-Man fan film can be. Some creators have welcomed the development. Others say "Lotus" has undermined the experience.
"These kids are going to go from saying, 'I can just pick up a camera and make a Spider-Man fan film' to 'I now have to compete in a fictional market of all of these other fan films that people have made, I'm going to have to make something equally as compelling, and I'm going to have to raise thousands of dollars to do it,"' Gleason said. "And it's antithetical to what a fan film is. It's a passion project. It's a labor of love. And money really isn't the most important part."
Talk to anyone in the community, and they'll probably mention two of the best-known Spider-Man fan films: "The Green Goblin's Last Stand" (1992) for which its creator, Dan Poole, tied himself to a building's fire escape and swung around; and "Peter's Web" (2011) by Roger King.
These grainy videos feature costumes that look as if they were cobbled together from a child's closet. But they, along with Joey Lever's 2014 "Spider-Man: Lost Cause," have inspired young filmmakers to don the red-and-blue suit themselves and mimic their hero, known to mainstream fans as the alter ego of Peter Parker, who acquired superpowers after a radioactive spider bite.
"At our core, we're just people who got bitten by the bug, no pun intended," Gleason said. "We literally just wanted to see ourselves in the Spider-Man suit, or we really wanted to tell a cool story with Spider-Man and we did everything within our power to make that happen."
In the past decade, thousands of young creators have posted their takes, making them a global phenomenon. Fans from different countries often add flair to their costumes. For example, Spider-Man India wears a hoodie and a British Spider-Man has white stripes.
"It has a reach that I could not even imagine or put into words," said Nero Omar, a 19-year-old visual effects artist from Singapore. He worked briefly on "Lotus" and now freelances for various Spider-Man projects. "It feels like a very niche community, but when you post your work, you're sharing it to everyone."
There are fan films for other superheroes, like Superman and Batman. But part of the appeal of Spider-Man is his universality. Unlike the billionaire Bruce Wayne or the otherworldly Superman, Peter Parker started life as an ordinary person.
"Anyone can fit in that mask. You could be any color, any gender," Lever said. "The whole point of Spider-Man is that he's in a uniform that covers your whole body."
Even though many of these videos may be copyright violations, major movie studios often avoid cracking down because they aren't worried about the competition and don't want to deter loyal fans, said James Boyle, a law professor at Duke University.
Representatives from Sony Pictures Entertainment did not respond to requests for comment. A representative for Jon Watts, the director of the latest live-action Spider-Man trilogy, declined to comment.
Many of the young men behind these projects see this as a chance to embark on a career in movies.
That was true for Konop, now 20, who is majoring in English at the University of California, Riverside, and wants to pursue filmmaking full-time after graduating.
Originally, Konop conceived "Lotus" as a small-scale passion project with a budget of about $ 20,000. He quickly exceeded that after posting it on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo in 2021, and when he released the first trailer that year, contributions skyrocketed to more than $ 100,000.
After finding performers through a mix of social media and auditions, Konop filmed for a few months in 2021 in New York City and Arkansas, where much of the cast is from. It was his first time away from his parents, he said.
The film features some tropes of the genre -- Spider-Man beating up bad guys or perched on a skyscraper in New York -- but it is more drama than action flick, a portrayal of a shattered hero in anguish over the death of Gwen Stacy.
In June 2022, about a year before the movie's release, a Twitter user named Thunder shared screenshots that showed Warden Wayne, the 23-year-old actor who plays the superhero in "Lotus," sending texts containing racial slurs. A couple of days later, a Twitter user named Berk circulated screenshots showing texts in which Konop used racial and homophobic slurs.
In response, the film's five-person visual effects team, including Omar, quit. Dozens of contributors on Indiegogo asked for refunds and for their names to be removed from the film credits. (The credits have not been removed.)
"Even though he had done that as a kid, he tainted the project," Omar said of Konop. "He still had to be held accountable for his actions."
In an interview with The New York Times, Wayne said that the texts were sent when he was a teenager being home-schooled in a conservative Christian environment and that they were examples of ignorance, not racism.
"I was in a bubble, where I wasn't aware of how serious it was for me to say these things or these words," Wayne said in an apology posted online at the time. "My ideas of right and wrong were skewed."
Konop, who apologized online when the screenshots appeared, said in an interview with The New York Times, "I was part of these communities of teenagers and people who didn't really fit in who were saying explicit things to get attention." He added that he was socially awkward at 14 or 15 years old and that he had "retreated to these communities where there were these kinds of people in the corners of the internet that you don't want to look into."
By the time he turned 16, he said, he had left those communities and began changing how he thought and talked.
Justin Hargrove, who plays a villain in "Lotus" and was one of the few Black actors involved, said in an interview that he had no problems with prejudice during production.
"I know what it's like to experience racism, actual racism, and I know what it's like to experience ignorance, and I didn't experience either of those two when I was on set," he said. "But I think what happened was just pure ignorance."
"Lotus" continues to be the subject of withering criticism online for the texts, but also for the project itself, leaving some fans divided about what a Spider-Man project should be. Is the goal to make a high-budget, high-profile video? Or were the relative obscurity and poor production values part of the point?
"Either we try and do what 'Lotus' did and get a budget, or we stick to what we've built and try and create something without, which is the hardest thing in the world," said Lever, who made "Lost Cause" for about 400 pounds (or about $ 510 today). Half of his budget went to creating the suit.
"You can't just get 100,000 pounds and make a film," he added. "You need to learn your craft, you need to make them shoestring budget films so you can learn the tips and tricks," he said.
For Gleason, it's worrying that "Lotus" is many viewers' introduction to the world of Spider-Man fan films.
He said it's a world that should have remained obscure.
"We're weirdos," he said. "We run around in skintight spandex and record it and pretend were some kind of sanctioned Marvel production."

Full text: The News
British antitrust officials said on Tuesday that they were reviewing a revised offer by Microsoft to win approval of its $ 69 billion merger with Activision Blizzard, an effort to clear the biggest remaining regulatory hurdle to the major video games deal.
To address the concerns of British regulators that the deal would stunt the development of a new area of gaming technology, Microsoft said it would transfer the cloud streaming licensing rights for all current and new Activision Blizzard games to Ubisoft Entertainment, a rival game publisher.
Why It Matters: The offer aims to address concerns over cloud gaming.
The deal that once faced long odds now appears to be on a path to approval. Britain is the last major holdout standing in the way of completing the blockbuster acquisition.
Microsoft's revised offer is an effort to win over the country's main antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, which said in April that it would to block the merger because of concerns about its impact on so-called cloud gaming, an emerging area of technology that lets people stream games on phones, tablets and other devices, potentially eliminating the need for consoles.
Under the new terms, Microsoft would give Ubisoft control over licensing deals for cloud gaming services for 15 years. This is aimed at preventing Microsoft from launching titles exclusively on its own cloud streaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming.
Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the Competition and Markets Authority, called the offer "substantially different from what was put on the table previously," yet cautioned that "this is not a green light."
"Our goal has not changed," she said in a statement. "Any future decision on this new deal will ensure that the growing cloud gaming market continues to benefit from open and effective competition driving innovation and choice."
Background: Microsoft has overcome other objections to the deal.
After announcing its intension to buy Activision in January 2022, Microsoft has faced a gantlet of scrutiny, as the deal has become a test of whether regulators around the world would approve a tech megamerger amid concerns about the industry's power. Rivals such as Sony lobbied for it to be blocked.
The acquisition faced an uphill climb after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block it in December and the British authorities said they would likewise try to stop the acquisition.
But Microsoft scored a major victory in May when the European Union approved the deal. And in July, a U.S. federal judge ruled against the F.T.C.'s efforts to slow down the deal, leaving only the British authorities as a major obstacle to clear.
What's Next: A decision is expected by October.
The British regulator said it would issue a decision by Oct. 18, the date that Microsoft has set as a deadline to complete its deal with Activision.

How the 'Spider-Verse' Influenced Animation: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie and other C.G.I. cartoons are taking a looser, imperfect approach. The style represents a shift made possible by Spidey's success.
When "TMNT," a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated film, was released in 2007, the critic Jeannette Catsoulis wrote in The New York Times that it offered "an impressive lack of visual texture." She was not wrong. The eponymous reptiles are rendered in an inert computer-generated form, as if they were modeled from plastic and then put on a screen. Their green skin is dull and smooth.
The same cannot be said for the turtles in the latest incarnation of the ooze-filled tale: "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem." In this new film, released Wednesday, our heroes -- Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo and Raphael -- appear to spring from a (talented) high school doodler's notebook. Their bodies and faces are rendered with an imperfect sketchy quality that makes their eyes vivid and their smiles vibrant. Their greenness is distinctive and gains extra contours when reflected in New York's neon lights.
"Mutant Mayhem," directed by Jeff Rowe, is representative of a larger shift that has occurred in the 16 years since "TMNT" was released. It's part of a wave of films that proves computer-generated animation doesn't have to look quite so, well, boring.
So what happened? Well, in 2018, "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" was released. "Into the Spider-Verse" -- along with its even more technically virtuosic sequel, "Across the Spider-Verse" this summer -- bucked the trend of modern animation by invoking its hero's comic-book origins with Ben-Day dots and wild, hallucinogenic sequences.
Since "Into the Spider-Verse" became a box office hit as well as an Oscar winner, major studios have grown less fearful of animation that diverges from the norm. The film proved that audiences wouldn't reject projects that look markedly different from the house styles of Pixar ("Toy Story") and DreamWorks ("Shrek"). Films like "Mutant Mayhem," "The Mitchells vs. The Machines," "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish" and "Nimona" all have distinctive looks that are visually sensational without conforming to established playbooks.
It's exciting for the filmmakers, too. "All animators ever did before that was have lunch with each other and bitch about how all animated movies look the same," Mike Rianda, director of "The Mitchells," told me in an interview. (Rianda is a member of SAG-AFTRA and spoke before the strike.)
Rianda -- who worked on that movie alongside Rowe, its co-director -- was developing it at Sony Pictures Animation while "Into the Spider-Verse" was in the works. (Both were produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller; "The Mitchells" was eventually released on Netflix in 2021.) "The Mitchells," about a kooky family's road trip during an A.I. takeover, looks like a window into the overstimulated mind of its teenage heroine, Katie Mitchell (voiced by Abbi Jacobson), an exuberant film geek -- and Rianda and Rowe wanted the animation to have all of her quirks. They felt that the humans should look imperfect and asymmetrical rather than like Pixar's "The Incredibles," because the plot concerned a battle between Homo sapiens weirdos and regulated robots.
Still, there was pressure from the studio to go the standard route. "That's easy," Rianda said. "The computer knows how to do that. It's already been taught that. It was wonderful to have 'Spider-Verse' going on in the next room so we could point to it and say, 'Look, they're doing it. We can do it too, right?"'
Films like "Into the Spider-Verse," and those that have followed in its footsteps, blend animation techniques that are common in 3-D computer-generated movies with those that were commonplace in the 2-D hand-drawn animation that preceded it. It's not just that the images are less photorealistic, the movements of the characters are as well. The results are more broadly impressionistic in the ways that Looney Tunes cartoons, Disney classics or decades of anime have been.
For instance, when the cat hero of "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish" sticks his sword into the thumbnail of a giant in the bravura musical opening sequence, the sky goes yellow as the giant gasps with pain. The giant's thumb turns red, and white lines reverberate in the background mimicking the throbbing.
"The Last Wish," directed by Joel Crawford, is linked to the era of animation dominated by C.G.I.; it is a spinoff of "Shrek," a hallmark of that time. For Crawford, "Into the Spider-Verse" showed studios that "audiences were not only accepting of different styles but craved it because you get the same thing over and over."
Crawford wanted to keep Puss recognizable to fans, but put him in the context of a "fairy tale painting." That meant rendering his fur more as brushstrokes rather than strands. Fur is actually a good barometer of the shift. In the 2022 DreamWorks caper "The Bad Guys," which follows a group of animal criminals, the wolf ringleader's coat looks like it has been shaped by pen strokes, a change from the way his fuzzier lupine brethren were crafted in Disney's 2016 comedy "Zootopia."
But all the animation directors I spoke with argued that the art has to come from a thematically relevant place. For "Nimona," now on Netflix, the directors Troy Quane and Nick Bruno landed on what they described as a "two-and-a-half-D" style that evoked medieval paintings, a fitting look for their graphic-novel adaptation set in a futuristic world with the chivalrous customs of the Middle Ages. A trailer for Disney's upcoming "Wish" has an illustrated quality in line with its storybook fable plot about a star descending from the sky. The effect is something out of an Arthur Rackham illustration or a Beatrix Potter book mashed up with "Frozen."
Rowe's initial goal for "Mutant Mayhem" was just to be as bold as possible, excising any timidity he had felt about pushing boundaries on "The Mitchells." As he spent more time working on the world of the Turtles, he figured out where those impulses were coming from and how they'd fit into the story. He and the production designer, Yashar Kassai, rediscovered drawings they had done as teenagers. "There's just this unmitigated expression and honesty to those kinds of drawings," Rowe said. "It's a movie about teenagers; that's our North Star. Let's commit to the art style looking like it was made by teenagers. Ideally the world and the characters will look like they drew themselves."
As a viewer, I find it's invigorating to see the animators on "Mutant Mayhem" quite literally coloring outside the lines. When the turtles jump across rooftops, the moon behind them appears to be vibrating scribbles. You can see (digital) pen lines in explosions and expressions.
"At first 'Spider-Verse' gave people permission," Rowe said. "And now I think with 'Spider-Verse 2,' it's made it a mandate. I think if anyone makes a film that looks like a C.G. 3-D film from the last 30 years now, it's going to feel dated." For audiences, that's great news.

Millions Follow Their Movie Reviews, but Don't Call Them Critics: [National Desk]

Full text: On MovieTok, reviewers can reach an audience of millions and earn tens of thousands of dollars per post. "Critics," they say, are old news.
Maddi Koch loves to spread the gospel about a good movie. Her favorites are little-noted thrillers with few stars but juicy concepts or dig-your-nails-into-the-sofa plot twists.
On TikTok, where Koch has three million followers (and goes by Maddi Moo), her review of "What Happened to Monday," about a dystopian world where seven identical sisters share a single identity, has drawn over 24 million views. "If I were to die tomorrow, I'd watch this tonight," she raved.
Koch, who is a senior at Virginia Tech and is sometimes paid by film companies to promote their work, says she makes videos to connect people and to spare them "the pain of arguing over finding a movie or not knowing what you're really looking for." (Most of her videos, including the "What Happened to Monday" review, are not sponsored.) When asked, she'll describe herself as a "random girl" who loves movies, a "content creator," or, sure, even an "influencer."
But one title that she would never use might be the most obvious: "Critic."
"I just don't see myself in that light," she said.
Koch, 22, is among dozens of personalities on TikTok, along with peers like Straw Hat Goofy and Cinema.Joe, who reach millions of people by reviewing, analyzing or promoting movies. Several earn enough on the platform -- from posts sponsored by Hollywood studios (many have taken a break from working with them since the actors' strike), through one of TikTok's revenue sharing programs or both -- to make their passion for film a full-time job, a feat amid longstanding cuts to arts critic positions in newsrooms.
But the new school of film critic doesn't see much of itself in the old one. And some tenets of the profession -- such as rendering judgments or making claims that go beyond one's personal taste -- are now considered antiquated and objectionable.
"When you read a critic's review, it almost sounds like a computer wrote it," said Cameron Kozak, 21, who calls himself a "movie reviewer" and has 1.5 million followers. "But when you have someone on TikTok who you watch every day and you know their voice and what they like, there's something personal that people can connect to."
On MovieTok -- as the community is known -- the most successful users generally post at least once per day, with videos typically ranging between 30 and 90 seconds. Many attempt to capture the viewer's attention within the first three seconds ("This movie's perfect for you if you never want to sleep again," begins Koch's review of the hit horror film "Barbarian") and speak directly to the camera, with screenshots from the film in the background.
Many creators, most in their 20s or early 30s, specialize within a particular niche. Joe Aragon (Cinema.Joe, 931,000 followers) is known for his breakdowns of coming attractions; Monse Gutierrez (cvnela, 1.4 million followers) and Bryan Lucious (stoney_tha_great, 387,000 followers) demystify and rank horror films; Seth Mullan-Feroze (sethsfilmreviews, 256,000 followers) leans toward art house and foreign cinema.
Unlike film departments at major metropolitan newspapers or national magazines, individuals on MovieTok generally don't aspire to review every noteworthy film. And while most expressed admiration for traditional critics' grasp of film history, they tended to associate the profession as a whole with false or unearned authority.
"A lot of us don't trust critics," said Lucious, 31. He was one of many who pointed to the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, where the scores of "Top Critics" often differ widely from those of casual users, as evidence that the critical establishment is out of touch. "They watch movies and are just looking for something to critique," he said. "Fans watch movies looking for entertainment."
MovieTok creators are not the first in the history of film criticism to rebel against their elders. In the 1950s, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and other writers of the journal Cahiers du Cinéma disavowed the nationalism of mainstream French criticism. In the 1960s and '70s, the New Yorker critic Pauline Kael assailed the moralism associated with Bosley Crowther, a longtime movie critic of The New York Times, and others. And movie bloggers in the 2000s charged print critics with indifference or hostility to superhero and fantasy films.
"There's always this denigrating of those so-called 'other' critics as somehow elitist and old-fashioned while presenting yourself as the new avant-garde," said Mattias Frey, head of the department of media, culture and creative industries at the City University of London and the author of "The Permanent Crisis of Film Criticism." He defined criticism, by any name, as "evaluation grounded in reason," citing the philosopher Noël Carroll.
Juju Green, a 31-year-old former advertising copywriter, sees himself as on a "mission to combat film snobbery." Known as Straw Hat Goofy, Green is the most prominent member of MovieTok, with 3.4 million followers and an emerging side career as a correspondent and host. His most popular video, in which he identifies Easter eggs in Pixar movies, has nearly 29 million views.
Seven years ago, Green started a movie-themed channel on YouTube -- which favors longer, more produced videos -- but abandoned it after the birth of his first child. On TikTok, he found that he could reach an enormous audience with relatively little effort. He said one of his first videos on the platform, a post from January 2020 about Tom Holland's performance in "Avengers: Endgame," received over 200,000 views in about an hour.
"I had a feeling like I was meant to do this," he said. Green quit his advertising job last year.
Without the salary of a news organization, MovieTok creators earn money by partnering with entertainment companies. A sponsored post promoting a film or streaming service can be worth anywhere from $ 1,000 to $ 30,000.
Green's clients have included Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros., among others. In January, Universal paid him to create a post at an N.F.L. game promoting the movie "M3GAN" that received nearly seven million views -- part of a marketing campaign that helped the film earn $ 30.2 million in the United States and Canada on opening weekend, about 30 percent more than box office analysts had predicted.
It is impossible, of course, to make a direct link between TikTok influencers and ticket sales. But there are signs that the impact can be considerable. Sony executives have cited MovieTok campaigns as one reason for the strong performance of "Insidious: The Red Door," which cost $ 16 million to make and has taken in a surprising $ 183 million worldwide.
Being paid by the studios presents an obvious conflict of interest. Creators may be reluctant to speak negatively about the products of a company that pays them (or might). While traditional news organizations, including The Times, sell ads to movie studios, they do not allow critics, reporters or editors to accept compensation from them and generally keep editorial and business operations separate.
Carrie Rickey, who was the film critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer from 1986 to 2011, said she refrained from working too closely with studios to avoid even the "appearance of impropriety."
"It would mar my reputation as an independent writer," she said.
Many on MovieTok have evolved an ad hoc code of ethics -- accepting payment only for trailer announcements or general recommendations, for example, rather than true reviews -- but recognize accusations of bias as an occupational hazard.
"I always try to be super transparent with my viewers," said Megan Cruz (jstoobs, 535,000 followers), noting that she is careful to identify gifts and sponsorships in her videos. "We do exist in this in-between space and I think it's important to clarify whenever you're getting any kind of advantage." (By law, paid endorsements on TikTok must be labeled; but gifts, including swag boxes and travel to red carpet events, are not always disclosed.)
Cruz, 34, echoed other MovieTok reviewers who said they dislike doing sharply negative posts and would be unlikely to slam a movie whether they were in business with the studio or not. She said she generally prefers to deliver negative opinions in the form of a "compliment sandwich," preceded and followed by more positive remarks.
"It pains me to say that this movie, by and large, did not work for me," she said, in a review of the horror-comedy "Renfield." Cruz then added: "There are a lot of individual elements of this film that really do work."
Another source of income is TikTok itself. Since 2020, the platform has shared revenue with accounts that meet eligibility requirements. Gutierrez said that between sponsored posts and payouts from TikTok she has made as much as four times the salary of her previous job as a substitute teacher.
After Hollywood actors went on strike in July, many creators stopped working for the studios in solidarity. SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, issued guidelines for influencers last month discouraging them from accepting "any new work for promotion of struck companies or their content."
Green, who had previously implied that he would continue working as usual, subsequently walked back those comments. He said in a recent interview that he had turned down eight proposals to work with struck companies and would continue to do so for the duration of the strike.
"It was a mistake that I made and I completely own that," he said.
The lack of Hollywood work has prompted many creators to pivot to other subjects, such as independent films and anime.
But with or without the studios, those interviewed for this story said their obsession with dissecting movies would remain.
"I like to call it professional overthinking," Green said.

He said one of his first videos on the platform, a post from January 2020 about Tom Holland’s performance in “Avengers: Endgame,” received more than 200,000 views in about an hour.
“I had a feeling like I was meant to do this,” he said. Green quit his advertising job last year.
Without the salary of a news organization, MovieTok creators earn money by partnering with entertainment companies. A sponsored post promoting a film or streaming service can be worth anywhere from $1,000 to $30,000.
Green’s clients have included Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros., among others. In January, Universal paid him to create a post at an NFL game promoting the movie “M3GAN” that received nearly 7 million views — part of a marketing campaign that helped the film earn $30.2 million in the United States and Canada on opening weekend, about 30% more than box office analysts had predicted.
It is impossible, of course, to make a direct link between TikTok influencers and ticket sales. But there are signs that the impact can be considerable. Sony executives have cited MovieTok campaigns as one reason for the strong performance of “Insidious: The Red Door,” which cost $16 million to make and has taken in a surprising $183 million worldwide.
Being paid by the studios presents an obvious conflict of interest. Creators may be reluctant to speak negatively about the products of a company that pays them (or might). While traditional news organizations, including the Times, sell ads to movie studios, they do not allow critics, reporters or editors to accept compensation from them and generally keep editorial and business operations separate.
Carrie Rickey, who was the film critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer from 1986 to 2011, said she refrained from working too closely with studios to avoid even the “appearance of impropriety.”
“It would mar my reputation as an independent writer,” she said.
Many on MovieTok have evolved an ad hoc code of ethics — accepting payment only for trailer announcements or general recommendations, for example, rather than true reviews — but recognize accusations of bias as an occupational hazard.
“I always try to be super transparent with my viewers,” said Megan Cruz (jstoobs, 535,000 followers), noting that she is careful to identify gifts and sponsorships in her videos. “We do exist in this in-between space, and I think it’s important to clarify whenever you’re getting any kind of advantage.” (By law, paid endorsements on TikTok must be labeled, but gifts, including swag boxes and travel to red carpet events, are not always disclosed.)
Cruz, 34, echoed other MovieTok reviewers who said they dislike doing sharply negative posts and would be unlikely to slam a movie whether they were in business with the studio or not. She said she generally prefers to deliver negative opinions in the form of a “compliment sandwich,” preceded and followed by more positive remarks.
“It pains me to say that this movie, by and large, did not work for me,” she said, in a review of the horror-comedy “Renfield.” Cruz then added, “There are a lot of individual elements of this film that really do work.”
Another source of income is TikTok itself. Since 2020, the platform has shared revenue with accounts that meet eligibility requirements. Gutierrez said that between sponsored posts and payouts from TikTok, she has made as much as four times the salary of her previous job as a substitute teacher.
After Hollywood actors went on strike in July, many creators stopped working for the studios in solidarity. SAG-AFTRA, the actors union, issued guidelines for influencers last month discouraging them from accepting “any new work for promotion of struck companies or their content.”
Green, who had previously implied that he would continue working as usual, subsequently walked back those comments. He said in a recent interview that he had turned down eight proposals to work with struck companies and would continue to do so for the duration of the strike.
“It was a mistake that I made, and I completely own that,” he said.
The lack of Hollywood work has prompted many creators to pivot to other subjects, such as independent films and anime.
But with or without the studios, those interviewed for this story said their obsession with dissecting movies would remain.
“I like to call it professional overthinking,” Green said.

They Review Movies on TikTok, but Don’t Call Them Critics

Maddi Koch loves to spread the gospel about a good movie. Her favorites are little-noted thrillers with few stars but juicy concepts or dig-your-nails-into-the-sofa plot twists.
On TikTok, where Koch has 3 million followers (and goes by Maddi Moo), her review of “What Happened to Monday,” about a dystopian world where seven identical sisters share a single identity, has drawn more than 24 million views. “If I were to die tomorrow, I’d watch this tonight,” she raved.
Koch, who is a senior at Virginia Tech and is sometimes paid by film companies to promote their work, said she makes videos to connect people and to spare them “the pain of arguing over finding a movie or not knowing what you’re really looking for.” (Most of her videos, including the “What Happened to Monday” review, are not sponsored.) When asked, she’ll describe herself as a “random girl” who loves movies, a “content creator,” or, sure, even an “influencer.”
But one title that she would never use might be the most obvious: “Critic.”
“I just don’t see myself in that light,” she said.
Koch, 22, is among dozens of personalities on TikTok, along with peers like Straw Hat Goofy and Cinema.Joe, who reach millions of people by reviewing, analyzing or promoting movies. Several earn enough on the platform — from posts sponsored by Hollywood studios (many have taken a break from working with them since the actors’ strike), through one of TikTok’s revenue sharing programs or both — to make their passion for film a full-time job, a feat amid long-standing cuts to arts critic positions in newsrooms.
But the new school of film critic doesn’t see much of itself in the old one. And some tenets of the profession — such as rendering judgments or making claims that go beyond one’s personal taste — are now considered antiquated and objectionable.
“When you read a critic’s review, it almost sounds like a computer wrote it,” said Cameron Kozak, 21, who calls himself a “movie reviewer” and has 1.5 million followers. “But when you have someone on TikTok who you watch every day and you know their voice and what they like, there’s something personal that people can connect to.”
On MovieTok — as the community is known — the most successful users generally post at least once per day, with videos typically ranging between 30 and 90 seconds. Many attempt to capture the viewer’s attention within the first three seconds (“This movie’s perfect for you if you never want to sleep again,” begins Koch’s review of the hit horror film “Barbarian”) and speak directly to the camera, with screenshots from the film in the background.
Many creators, most in their 20s or early 30s, specialize within a particular niche. Joe Aragon (Cinema.Joe, 931,000 followers) is known for his breakdowns of coming attractions; Monse Gutierrez (cvnela, 1.4 million followers) and Bryan Lucious (stoney_tha_great, 387,000 followers) demystify and rank horror films; Seth Mullan-Feroze (sethsfilmreviews, 256,000 followers) leans toward art house and foreign cinema.
Unlike film departments at major metropolitan newspapers or national magazines, individuals on MovieTok generally don’t aspire to review every noteworthy film. And while most expressed admiration for traditional critics’ grasp of film history, they tended to associate the profession as a whole with false or unearned authority.
“A lot of us don’t trust critics,” said Lucious, 31. He was one of many who pointed to the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, where the scores of “Top Critics” often differ widely from those of casual users, as evidence that the critical establishment is out of touch. “They watch movies and are just looking for something to critique,” he said. “Fans watch movies looking for entertainment.”
MovieTok creators are not the first in the history of film criticism to rebel against their elders. In the 1950s, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and other writers of the journal Cahiers du Cinéma disavowed the nationalism of mainstream French criticism. In the 1960s and ’70s, New Yorker critic Pauline Kael assailed the moralism associated with Bosley Crowther, a longtime movie critic of The New York Times, and others. And movie bloggers in the 2000s charged print critics with indifference or hostility to superhero and fantasy films.
“There’s always this denigrating of those so-called ‘other’ critics as somehow elitist and old-fashioned while presenting yourself as the new avant-garde,” said Mattias Frey, head of the department of media, culture and creative industries at the City University of London and the author of “The Permanent Crisis of Film Criticism.” He defined criticism, by any name, as “evaluation grounded in reason,” citing philosopher Noël Carroll.
Juju Green, a 31-year-old former advertising copywriter, sees himself as on a “mission to combat film snobbery." Known as Straw Hat Goofy, Green is the most prominent member of MovieTok, with 3.4 million followers and an emerging side career as a correspondent and host. His most popular video, in which he identifies Easter eggs in Pixar movies, has nearly 29 million views.
Seven years ago, Green started a movie-themed channel on YouTube — which favors longer, more produced videos — but abandoned it after the birth of his first child. On TikTok, he found that he could reach an enormous audience with relatively little effort. He said one of his first videos on the platform, a post from January 2020 about Tom Holland’s performance in “Avengers: Endgame,” received more than 200,000 views in about an hour.
“I had a feeling like I was meant to do this,” he said. Green quit his advertising job last year.
Without the salary of a news organization, MovieTok creators earn money by partnering with entertainment companies. A sponsored post promoting a film or streaming service can be worth anywhere from $1,000 to $30,000.

Rodriguez, 81, Folk Singer Whose Career Hit Its Stride Late, Is Dead: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two albums in the early 1970s went largely unnoticed in the United States, but not overseas. Then came the 2012 documentary "Searching for Sugar Man."
Rodriguez, a Detroit musician whose songs, full of protest and stark imagery from the urban streets, failed to find an American audience in the early 1970s but resonated in Australia and especially South Africa, leading to a late-career resurgence captured in the Oscar-winning documentary "Searching for Sugar Man" in 2012, died on Tuesday. He was 81.
A posting on his official website announced his death but did not say where he died or provide a cause.
Rodriguez's story was, as The New York Times put it in 2012, "a real-life tale of talent disregarded, bad luck and missed opportunities, with an improbable stop in the Hamptons and a Hollywood conclusion."
Rodriguez -- who performed under just his surname but whose full name was Sixto Diaz Rodriguez -- was playing bars in Detroit in the late 1960s, his folk-rock reminding those who heard it of Bob Dylan, when the producer Harry Balk signed him. In the documentary, Dennis Coffey and Mike Theodore, who would go on to produce his first album, "Cold Fact" (1970), told of hearing Rodriguez at a particularly smoky establishment called the Sewer on the Detroit River, where he was playing, as he often did, with his back to the audience.
"Maybe it forced you to listen to the lyrics, because you couldn't see the guy's face," Mr. Coffey said.
A single released under the name "Rod Riguez" went nowhere. "Cold Fact," released on the Sussex label, drew a smattering of favorable notices; its first track, "Sugar Man," gave the documentary its title.
"Rodriguez is a singing poet/journalist, telling stories of today," Jim Knippenberg wrote in The Cincinnati Enquirer. "He does it with a voice much like Dylan's, very Dylanesque imagery and a musical backing dominated almost entirely by a guitar. But he's not a Dylan carbon. Rodriguez is much more explicit."
Mostly, though, the album went unnoticed in America, as did its follow-up a year later, "Coming From Reality."
"Getting the records cut was easy," Rodriguez told The Sydney Morning Herald of Australia in 1979. "Getting them played was a lot harder."
He was being interviewed by an Australian newspaper that year because, while he had settled into a life as a laborer and office worker in Detroit (though still playing bars and even running unsuccessfully for various political offices), he had -- unknown to him -- been developing fans overseas. Australia was one place where his music had found an audience, and in 1979 he was invited to tour there. He returned in 1981 for a few shows with the band Midnight Oil and released a live album in Australia.
Rodriguez's music had found an even bigger following in South Africa, which was still under apartheid and cut off from the rest of the world in many respects. He seemed to have no idea how popular he was there, especially among white South Africans uncomfortable with apartheid and the country's rigidly conservative culture.
"To many of us South Africans, he was the soundtrack to our lives," Stephen Segerman, owner of a Cape Town record store, said in the documentary. "In the mid-'70s, if you walked into a random white, liberal, middle-class household that had a turntable and a pile of pop records, and if you flipped through the records, you would always see 'Abbey Road' by the Beatles, you'd always see 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' by Simon and Garfunkel, and you would always see 'Cold Fact' by Rodriguez. To us, it was one of the most famous records of all time. The message it had was 'Be anti-establishment."'
In the mid-1990s Mr. Segerman began trying to find out more about the mysterious artist known as Rodriguez and how he had died; rumors were rampant that he had killed himself onstage, died of an overdose, and so on. He joined forces with Craig Bartholomew-Strydom, a journalist who was also searching for Rodriguez, and eventually they found the singer, still living in Detroit. A 1998 tour of South Africa followed, with Rodriguez playing six sold-out shows at 5,000-seat arenas.
"It was strange seeing all those bright white faces, all of them knowing every word to every one of my songs," he told The Sunday Telegraph of Britain in 2009.
After the South Africa tour he played shows in England, Sweden and other countries. In the United States, the label Light in the Attic rereleased "Cold Fact" in 2008 and "Coming From Reality" in 2009.
And there was another round of rediscovery ahead. In 2012 Malik Bendjelloul released "Searching for Sugar Man," his first and only documentary (he died in 2014), to rave reviews. The film, which won the Oscar for best documentary feature, concentrated on the search by Mr. Segerman and Mr. Bartholomew-Strydom and included an interview with Rodriguez, who in the aftermath found himself at the Hamptons International Film Festival and embarking on a fresh round of touring.
Matt Sullivan founded Light in the Attic Records, which reissued Rodriguez's albums.
"His words and music were brutally honest and raw to the core," he said by email. "It instantly struck a chord the second we heard it, and still does, nearly 20 years later."
Sixto Diaz Rodriguez was born on July 10, 1942, in Detroit. His mother, Maria, died when he was a boy. His father, Ramon, was a laborer who became a foreman at a steel plant.
He said that he started playing the guitar at 16.
"Of course I've been into Dylan forever," he told The Times in 2012, "and also Barry McGuire, the whole 'Eve of Destruction' thing."
During his period of relative anonymity after the release of his albums, he earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Wayne State University in Detroit.
Information about his survivors was not immediately available.
The "Coming From Reality" album includes a song called "Cause," a lament about hard times and life's disappointments.
"They told me everybody's got to pay their dues," Rodriguez sings. "And I explained that I had overpaid them."
But in the 2009 interview with The Sunday Telegraph, he was more serene about his unusual career path.
"My story isn't a rags to riches story," he said. "It's rags to rags, and I'm glad about that. Where other people live in an artificial world, I feel I live in the real world. And nothing beats reality."

Full text: Success came relatively easy -- until he tried acting. For a moment, journalism seemed more viable. But now he's the lead in "Shortcomings."
Five years after Justin H. Min began pursuing acting by Googling "how to pursue acting," he thought he was getting the hang of it. He had made a viral commercial, and he was in contention for three major roles.
He landed none of them.
"I was not nervous and I did everything I wanted to," Min recalled of the auditions. "And that's the most devastating because you're like, 'I guess I just don't have it."'
It was in this less-than-healthy head space that Min decided to pivot to a different unstable profession: travel writing. He had caught on with a British magazine and it seemed he might cobble together full-time work as a freelance writer if he got on a plane to London.
So Min told his manager he was moving. But rather than beg him to stay (as Min had secretly hoped), the manager gave his full blessing. Before Min could head for the airport, though, a fellow actor urged him to reconsider -- timely encouragement that set Min, now 34, on the path to "a star-making performance," as a critic for The Times put it, in the new comedy "Shortcomings," as well as fan-favorite turns in the Netflix series "Beef" and "The Umbrella Academy."
"This sounds absurd, but I don't think I've really ever struggled with failure until I started to pursue acting," Min said in a prestrike interview. "So I will absolutely savor this."
INDEED, EVERYTHING IN the first 20-ish years of Min's life had come to him with relative ease. He concedes this only very sheepishly and with many disclaimers about how fortunate he feels.
In Cerritos, Calif., the predominantly Asian suburb where he grew up, Min felt little sense of difference. He found that most success was attainable through application. Min was class president all four years of high school and elected king of the winter formal. He was so good in speech and debate competitions that he won thousands of dollars in prize money that helped pay for a Cornell education. Given his gifts, he thought he might become a lawyer -- or maybe a politician.
But on the day Min was to graduate from college, he woke up to nine missed calls. His grandfather, who had flown in for the occasion, had died that morning. And so Min's commencement walk ended in a teary embrace with his family.
The death of Min's grandfather pushed him to reflect during a solo, cross-country road trip back home to Cerritos.
"What do I really want to do?" Min recalled asking himself. Life was fleeting, he now understood. Becoming a lawyer or a politician just didn't feel right anymore. He liked public speaking, writing and storytelling. And back under his parents' roof, he was near Los Angeles anyway. He decided to give acting a shot.
He soon discovered, however, how hard the business of acting really was and that applying himself would not be enough.
When he ran into college friends and they asked about his acting career, "I remember feeling so shattered and so lost in terms of what to say or how to present myself because I no longer could stand on accomplishments," he said. "I didn't have that anymore."
IT WAS SLOW going at first. Min dove into Reddit threads, took classes, searched for agents and discovered Wong Fu Productions, a content company run by young Asian Americans that would become a popular part of Asian American media as YouTube blossomed in the 2010s. The guys running it asked Min to audition for what he said they called a "narrative thing, but like branded content."
The "narrative thing" was essentially an eight-minute advertisement for a Simplehuman trash can. But it was built around an exploration of adulting, and the video received tens of millions of views.
That work didn't pay much, and Min began to dabble in journalism as a side hustle. He was a good writer and his photography, like most things in his life, had drawn praise.
He traveled to Mexico City to interview the chef Enrique Olvera at Pujol; and to Chicago to pick the brain of Grant Achatz at Alinea. What was not to like about work trips to two of the world's most acclaimed restaurants?
Which helps explain why Min was willing to give writing a full go when he got those back-to-back-to-back acting rejections. But as he pondered his next move, Min had dinner with a friend, the actress Amy Okuda. She tapped the brakes on his travel plans.
"I think everybody saw something in Justin and I did, too," Okuda said in a prestrike interview. So she sent a note about Min to her own manager, Joshua Pasch, who got in touch with him almost immediately; Pasch even had Min submit an audition tape for "The Umbrella Academy" before the pair met.
"The rest is history," Pasch said. "He was on the show a month later."
MIN HAD LANDED THE ROLE of Ben Hargreeves on what would become a hit for Netflix. His part was modest at first -- a dead brother in a superhuman sibling squad who occasionally shows up as a ghostlike figure that only the drug-addled sibling, Klaus, can see. The character had very little screen time, and Min was not a series regular initially.
But Ben became surprisingly popular in Min's hands. Steve Blackman, the showrunner, came up with a way to expand the role and even bring Ben back to life as a different, meaner version of himself in later seasons.
"The character of Ben doesn't really exist that much in the graphic novel" on which "Umbrella Academy" is based, Blackman said. "I wrote Ben in to be someone that Klaus could talk to and only Klaus could see."
But, he added, "the minute Justin embodied the character, I'm like, 'Oh, we've got to do so much more."'
"The Umbrella Academy," which premiered in 2019, was an "I made it" moment for Min. But he would also earn acclaim two years later for his thoughtful, sincere portrayal of the titular robot in "After Yang," a quiet sci-fi drama starring Colin Farrell.
"He had such a rich life before he became an actor," Kogonada, who directed "After Yang," said of Min. "Like all the great actors, he is consumed with his craft. But I feel like I'm getting to know him better through the different roles that he plays."
Then came "Beef," and the part of Edwin, an irritatingly perfect leader of a Korean church.
Lee Sung Jin, the director of "Beef," was best friends with Min's brother, Jason, in college. Lee said in an interview that he had called Jason Min, an admired praise leader, into the writers' room to help craft the character of Edwin. It was a role Lee said he had always intended for Justin to fill.
Both Min and Lee recalled being in Las Vegas years earlier for Jason's bachelor party and promising each other that they were going to make it in Hollywood, and that they would work together when they did.
"Drunk confidence," Lee said.
NOW MIN IS PLAYING another Ben. This one, the main character in "Shortcomings," is not a ghost but a very flawed would-be filmmaker who, in the words of a girlfriend, is brimming with "anger, depression, your weird self-hatred issues and just the relentless negativity."
Min "is probably the only person who could have played him in the way that he did, with such nuance," Ally Maki, who plays the girlfriend, Miko, said in a prestrike interview.
Min recalled reading the script and saying to himself: "I understand this guy because I was this guy" and "parts of me are still this guy."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When he initially read the first scene -- in which Ben complains about a "Crazy Rich Asians"-style movie that everyone else liked -- Min said the words felt natural tumbling out of his mouth.
Ben is dealing with the gap between his elevated tastes and his lack of career success, he said, "and that disparity is crippling. I remember when I started off in this business, I felt the same disparity. I felt such a chasm between the projects I was doing and the projects that I wanted to do."
"It results in a lot of dissatisfaction. It results in a lot of cynicism," he continued, recalling how, at one point, "I sort of prided myself in being sort of this funny, cynical, dry kind of guy the way that Ben is. And then through many years of therapy, I realized that that was simply a defense mechanism for me to hide and shield myself from the actual pain of feeling like I had failed at this industry that I so wanted to succeed in."
Min holds onto one particular memory from the movie. Ben is sprinting through the West Village -- that classic movie moment when the hero tries to salvage the relationship before it's gone forever. In the midst of the scene, he thought, "This is crazy that I am in New York in the middle of this busy West Village street, running as the lead of this movie," he said. And he remembered how some of his favorite movies had iconic running shots. "I never thought that I was going to be the guy who was running."

Full text: The mayhem touched off by a social media personality's game console giveaway tested the New York Police Department's response.
About 12:30 p.m. Friday, the New York Police Department's entertainment unit saw that Kai Cenat, a social-media streamer who has more than 6 million followers, had said that he would be in Manhattan's Union Square that day, ready to give away free PlayStation 5 consoles and other prizes to fans who showed up.
The local precinct sent a few officers and supervisors. By 1:30 p.m., there were about 300 fans in Union Square.
"Not a big crowd," Jeffrey Maddrey, the chief of the department, said at a news conference on Friday. "Something we'd expect for a social media event like this."
The crowd grew. Fast.
Soon, there were about 6,000 people massed in Union Square. Chaos ensued: Fans of Mr. Cenat darted in and out of traffic, climbing on the hoods of cabs and other cars. Others clambered up lampposts and traffic signs, toppled trash cans or threw objects at police officers. Several set off firecrackers, sending throngs of people running. The swarm spilled out onto Broadway, Park Avenue and other neighboring streets to the north, south, west and east.
By the end of the afternoon, at least 66 people -- about half of them minors -- had been arrested. Mr. Cenat, who had tried to flee the giant crowd in a black SUV, was charged with inciting a riot, among other offenses. By 6 p.m., the crowd had dispersed but questions remain over how it grew so large and dangerous.
The charges against the crowd included disorderly conduct; unlawful assembly; resisting arrest; inciting to riot; riot; obstruction of governmental administration; failure to disperse; and criminal possession of a weapon.
On Monday evening, a statement from Mr. Cenat's Any Means Possible group said no one had anticipated the scale of the event and that they were "deeply disappointed by the outbreak of disorderly conduct." But how might the mayhem been avoided?
Where did this crowd come from?
Mr. Cenat, 21, has developed a huge following thanks to his high-energy videos on YouTube and Twitch, a livestreaming service where he is among the most watched.
He has posted shakily filmed clips of himself shopping in Tokyo, buying his mother a house and fleeing enormous snakes. He also livestreams himself playing video games with rappers, and has shared a video where he goes to dorms and asks college students if he can spend the night in their rooms.
Mr. Cenat, who is from the Bronx, told his Twitch followers on Wednesday that he would be in Union Square on Friday. He asked how many fans would show up.
A flurry of answers came in: 1,000, 5,000, 10,000. A friend sitting next to him said so many would come that Mr. Cenat would need security and barricades.
"All trains go here so there's no excuse," Mr. Cenat told those watching. "I love you all so much, bro."
Word spread, and his followers flocked to Union Square.
How are police supposed to respond?
Most event organizers obtain city permits so that law enforcement can close streets and create access points. Mr. Cenat did not notify authorities or get a permit, Chief Maddrey said.
When a crowd surges, the police can activate what they call a rapid mobilization, designating an emergency that requires swift backup, according to the Police Department patrol guide.
On Friday, officials called in a level-four mobilization -- the most urgent. Soon after, hundreds of officers including members of specialty units like the counterterrorism bureau and the strategic response group swooped in.
Officers in tactical gear formed lines to herd people out, as a loudspeaker told the crowd to get out of the area. "If you leave voluntarily, no charges will be placed against you," they said in a message played over a loudspeaker. "If you refuse to leave, you will be arrested for unlawful assembly."
That kind of response is necessary, said Brian Higgins, a security and public safety consultant and former chief of the Bergen County, N.J., police department.
A crowd as large and rowdy as Friday's is "extremely dangerous," said Mr. Higgins, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, threatening a deadly crush, he said.
"When it gets to that point," Mr. Higgins said, "it really has to be brought down with force."
Were the police too aggressive?
A video with more than 2.2 million views on Twitter shows a disturbing encounter from Friday: A young man in a red sweatshirt stands looking confused as a crowd flees approaching officers. Two officers grab the man and hurl him at the rear of the taxi. His head hits the broken window, and he is placed under arrest.
The police said the incident is under review.
The Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates police misconduct, said it was looking into four incidents, including the arrest of the man in the sweatshirt, according to a spokeswoman.
Edwin Raymond, who retired as a lieutenant this past spring, said officials should review their response. Rather than arrest Mr. Cenat immediately, for example, the police could have used him to address the crowd, he said.
"The minute that the N.Y.P.D. moved Kai Cenat from the scene, they lost their chance to leverage him," Mr. Raymond said.
Chief Maddrey said officers showed restraint dealing with people, many of them minors, who destroyed police vehicles, including his own. Officers escalated force in proportion with the crowd's behavior, said Chief Maddrey, who described getting hit in the head with an object.
"We had to be very, very delicate in how we handled this," he said. "We wanted the kids to just comply with us and leave. But we were met with a lot of resistance. We were attacked."
What lessons should be drawn?
Mayor Eric Adams said young people are "being inundated by influencers."
"Our children cannot be raised by social media" he said on Saturday at a news conference in Brooklyn. "Our children cannot get their values, their beliefs from social media and other outside entities."
He also said the event drew people "from outside of the city" and that officials are "looking into where there's some even outside agitators."
"You don't come to get free Game Boys and bring smoke bombs and bring M80s and bring other disruptive items," Mayor Adams said.
Chief Maddrey said Monday on Fox 5 New York that many parents came to Union Square to see whether their children had been hurt in the melee or arrested.
"We don't want to touch your children," he said "We don't want them to go to jail. We want you to be mom and dad, grandma, uncle. Grab the young person and say, stop it now."
Mr. Higgins said the blame lies squarely on a social media personality who failed to take the proper steps to ensure a safe event and unruly fans who failed to listen to the police.
"Disperse when you're told to disperse," he said.
The police should not underestimate the lure of free goods, Mr. Higgins said. Shirts and hats are not a big deal, Mr. Higgins said. Free game consoles?
"That's something that should have been picked up on," he said.
Did anyone get a PlayStation 5?
As of Monday afternoon, it was unclear whether any fans received the prizes Mr. Cenat had offered.

Full text: Two YouTube hosts have built a following by dissecting the psychology of movie characters. Here, they analyze some of this summer's familiar faces.
Is Indiana Jones better at burying his feelings than digging up priceless artifacts? How might Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver's characters in "Marriage Story" have better navigated divorce and co-parenting? Hey, wait a minute: Does the hero of "The Lego Batman Movie" contain all the building blocks of a narcissist?
Such questions are the bread and butter -- or perhaps the popcorn and butter-flavored topping -- of the YouTube series "Cinema Therapy." Founded in 2020 by its hosts, Jonathan Decker, a marriage and family therapist, and Alan Seawright, a filmmaker, the channel has built a following in part by holding faux therapy sessions for heroes, villains and onscreen couples, treating movie plots and characters as case studies for mental health topics. Some typical titles: "Psychology of a Hero: 'Hulk' and Anger Management," "Villain Therapy: Jobu Tupaki From 'Everything Everywhere All at Once"' and "Movie Couple Therapy: 'Shrek."'
Like TikTok therapists and mindfulness podcasts, "Cinema Therapy" is part of a wave of modern media that delves into topics once reserved for psychology books, academic journals and, well, actual therapy. The hosts and their team shoot the videos in the basement of Seawright's Utah home. By YouTube's count, many episodes have been viewed more than a million times each.
In a recent interview, Decker and Seawright, both 42, discussed characters from four of this summer's big movies.
Barbie
Greta Gerwig's take on the toy line centers on a version of Barbie (Margot Robbie) whose ostensibly perfect life is interrupted when she develops flat feet and irrepressible thoughts of death.
DECKER Barbie is having an existential crisis. We see this in real life -- the whole, "things start to go wrong in my life and I'm not sure why, because I'm just chugging along like I always have been." And the assumption is, what I've always been doing is fine. There's a phrase in trauma healing, "the thing that used to help you has now got you stuck." What saved me before is now hurting me.
SEAWRIGHT There's a difference in life, and in film characters, between what the character wants and what they need.
DECKER Barbie wants everything to just keep going the way it's going. What she needs is self-reflection, introspection and perspective-taking. Perspective-taking allows her to make a shift, to let go of the thing that worked for her in the past and to walk into a future that's going to work for her. What I would prescribe is exactly what the movie does.
J. Robert Oppenheimer
"Oppenheimer," Christopher Nolan's biopic about the man who was central to the development of the atomic bomb, shows its subject (played by Cillian Murphy) grappling with the consequences of his invention -- and maintaining a romantic connection with a political activist, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), while married to Katherine Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), known as Kitty.
SEAWRIGHT It was really fascinating to see [Nolan] apply his complex, nonlinear time sense to a guy who, in a very similar way, looked at the rules of physics and was like, "No, I'm going to break those" -- and who looked at the rules of relationships and went, "No, I'm going to break those."
DECKER Oppenheimer to me, it's like the difference between narcissism and hubris. Because Oppenheimer isn't devoid of compassion for other people. Generally, he doesn't put others down to make himself look better. He does think that he is unique and specially gifted, but, to be fair, he was. So Oppenheimer is not a narcissist, but he does have a high amount of hubris. It's the hubris that led to the naïveté -- the naïveté in his personal relationships that, "I can carry on with Jean while being married to Kitty and this'll go fine." What I would prescribe in therapy is cognitive behavioral treatment exploring his assumptions about himself and the world around him, to challenge that thinking.
Miles and Rio Morales
One story line in "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse," the latest adventure of the teenage hero Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), finds Miles furthering a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld). Miles's mother, Rio Morales (Lauren Vélez), struggles to accept it -- though she does come around.
DECKER In adulthood, presumably, we have full autonomy. In childhood, we're very reliant on our parents. And then in between is where the power struggle happens, where kids want more power than the parents feel they're ready for, and parents want more control than the kids want to give them. Alan and I both feel the same way: There have been so many unhealthy relationships played for drama, that to actually show people growing and doing right by each other is not only refreshing -- I think it's the future of storytelling. Some of our more popular episodes have been about healthy movie marriages or things where we show what good parenting looks like. People are like, "I have plenty of examples in my real life of what the negative looks like." And so I like to see Miles's mom arrive where she did.
Indiana Jones
Harrison Ford's whip-snapping archaeologist is in low spirits at the start of "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny," which finds an aging Indy separated from his wife, Marion (Karen Allen), and grieving the death of their son.
SEAWRIGHT This is a married couple who lost a son. They need to be in therapy. Granted, it's, what, the late '60s, early '70s? That's not really a thing that's done.
DECKER I don't know if I would give him major depressive disorder, maybe dysthymic disorder, which is like depressive disorder but it doesn't have as many rigorous criteria. Instead of chronic, it would be circumstantial: circumstantial related to aging, the loss of his son, his separation from his wife. The way he has a lack of not just energy, but a lack of interest in life, in people. The things that used to excite him don't excite him anymore. What I would urge him to do in counseling is to not do what he generally does, which is to bury his feelings. I would advise him to go to therapy with Marion and to work on expressing his vulnerability and opening up to her.

Use These Fans to Keep Cool. Or to Channel Beyoncé.: [Style Desk]

Full text: They could also be used to say, "I love you." Can an air-conditioner do that?
In the 19th century, Duvelleroy, a hand fan manufacturer in Paris, published a marketing pamphlet called "The Language of the Fan." It featured a list of gestures one could make with a fan and the meaning of each.
To carry a fan open in your left hand, according to the pamphlet, signaled "come talk to me." Drawing a fan across one's cheek: "I love you." Placing a fan on one's left ear: "I wish to get rid of you."
When temperatures rise from steamy to sweltering, as they have lately in much of the world, pulling out a fan can make a more universal statement: It's way too hot out.
There are hand fans on the market for every taste. Many can get someone from the subway to the office in a moderately dry state. But just as how a fan is held can communicate something about its user, so too can the style of the fan a person holds. Whipping out the fan sold at Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, for instance, signals die-hard fandom.
Few options are more practical for a shvitzing city dweller than a simple paper folding fan from Pearl River ( $ 3). Sold in cheery shades of yellow and turquoise, it is cheap enough to buy in bulk and to misplace without regret. Extras can be stored in tote bags or given to a sweaty friend.
Pearl River's scented colorful wood fan ( $ 6) is just as practical and is sold in a variety of scents (melon, ylang-ylang, sakura) that would help freshen the air on a train platform full of sweaty commuters at rush hour. A bit more polished, but no less fragrant, are the fans from Miya Shinma (150 euros; about $ 166), a Japanese perfumer in Paris. The fans, which are made from bamboo and Japanese washi paper, come with a black lacquered box and are sold in three floral scents.
Those seeking refuge from heat in the air-conditioned halls of a museum may notice fans displayed as objects and in artworks like "Dancer With a Fan" by Edgar Degas and "Lady With a Fan" by Gustav Klimt. It should come as no surprise, then, that museums' gift shops are fertile terrain for fan hunting.
The Weimar-inclined may prefer the boldly patterned fan made of black and blue silk ( $ 32) from the Neue Galerie's gift shop. For an option that more obviously nods to art history, consider the fan featuring the Japanese artist Hokusai's "Great Wave" block print from the shops at the de Young and Legion of Honor museums in San Francisco ( $ 20).
Film, too, is filled with fans, including the delicate pearl-and-lace fan Audrey Hepburn carries in "War and Peace" and the intricate pink fan Kirsten Dunst wields seductively as the titular character in "Marie Antoinette."
For those who want to live their own Versailles fantasy, Agnès b. offers a gold-tinged folding fan made from sycamore wood and cotton canvas ( $ 170). According to the brand, the fan is a homage to the town of Versailles, which is where Agnès b.'s founder and designer, Agnés Troublé, grew up.
A closer approximation to the fan used by Ms. Dunst in "Marie Antoinette" is a pink silk hand fan with a pleasing rose-colored tassel from the Etsy store Brownskylight ( $ 30). Gucci's lilac-and-green flower print fan, which has a lush flora-and-fauna print on its screen and a gold interlocking G logo charm on its handle, also looks like it could have been lifted from a royal court. At $ 440, the fan, which is made with silk satin and wood, is royally priced, too.
To conjure the tropics and their refreshing breezes, try a softly pleated Iraca hand fan from the Etsy store CoroCoraColombia ( $ 33). The fan is made with Iraca palm straw and would look as elegant on a shelf as it would in a hand. So would Baba Tree's Bolga fan ( $ 35), which is handwoven from vetiver grass. Both fans have handles with a hook, making it easy to attach either to a bag with a ribbon or a carabiner.
The watermelon Iraca hand fan ( $ 37), also from CoroCoraColombia, seems ideal for cooling down at a picnic or a garden party. So does Pubumésu's lemon fan ( $ 143), which is made with calf-hide leather and ox horn. Pubumésu's line of luxe leather fans also includes a graphic fish fan ( $ 151) and an ivory crab fan ( $ 158) that unfolds to reveal a large orange crustacean and tiny starfish.
Duvelleroy, it should be noted, is still in the fan-making business. Among its most functional fans is the Take Away, which is available in a few colors and comes with an adjustable cord so it can be worn like a handbag. For a stately option, try the navy blue Take Away ( $ 93). A sportier choice would be the Kelly green Take Away that Duvelleroy produced in collaboration with the Frankie Shop ( $ 87).
Like any hand fan, both of those, as Duvelleroy's "Language of the Fan" pamphlet instructs, can be drawn across the face as a subtle signal of affection when not being used to cool down. If subtlety is not your lover's strong suit, Olivier Bernoux's heart-shaped Mon Amour fan ( $ 160) may convey your feelings more clearly.
All Consuming is a column about things we see -- and want to buy right now.

Full text: Thousands of people descended on the Manhattan park after Kai Cenat, a popular YouTube and Twitch streamer, promised to hand out free game consoles.
A popular social media streamer faced a charge of inciting a riot on Friday when an event at Manhattan's Union Square Park where he planned to give away video game consoles descended into mayhem, drawing a crowd estimated at several thousand young people.
In addition to the riot count, the livestreamer, Kai Carlo Cenat III, was expected to be charged with unlawful assembly and, potentially, other crimes, Jeffrey Maddrey, the Police Department's chief of department, said at a news conference late Friday.
The episode, which began shortly after 3 p.m. and was effectively over by 6 p.m., resulted in 65 arrests (nearly half of them of juveniles); injuries to officers and some of those in the crowd; and damage to food carts, police vehicles and stores, officials said.
"It was uncontrolled. It took us a while to get it under control. And a lot of young people got hurt," the official, Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, said, speaking against the backdrop of a trash-littered plaza at one of two news conference held after the park had been cleared.
Mr. Cenat and another streamer, Fanum, had announced plans to hand out PlayStation 5 consoles at the park at 4 p.m. The two are members of the streaming group AMP, which has legions of fans on YouTube and the streaming site Twitch. Mr. Cenat's YouTube channel has more than 3.6 million followers.
The event was spontaneous and came together without a city permit, Chief Maddrey said. The police learned of the gathering from a social media post around midday, he added. By 3 p.m., he said, "the post had gone viral."
At that point, he said, "the event grew exponentially, rapidly, vast."
Hordes of young people were soon packing the park and spilling onto the surrounding streets and sidewalks, where they blocked cars and pedestrians. The popular Union Square Greenmarket shut down early. Subway trains began bypassing the Union Square station.
As 4 p.m. approached and the crowd grew restless, the Police Department initiated a Level 4 mobilization, its highest-level response. While parts of the crowd remained mostly peaceful, others tipped into unruliness. One cluster of people stormed a construction site and then began hurling building materials, rocks and bottles at one another, the chief said.
"You had people walking around with shovels, axes and other tools of the construction trade," he said, adding that others had been lighting fireworks and tossing them toward officers and one another.
When the scheduled giveaway time came and went, the pandemonium increased.
Water bottles, basketballs, a computer and fireworks sailed through the crowd. One group of young people pushed back against police officers carrying riot shields as they tried to move in to make arrests. A knot of more than 200 people standing near a flagpole at the center of the park directed a vulgar chant at the police. Images from the scene showed people climbing onto cars stuck in the crowd.
People in the crowd began to "commit acts of violence against the police and the public," Chief Maddrey said.
"A lot of these young people, they were not following our orders," he said. "They really wanted to see this influencer."
By 5 p.m., the police had pushed most of the crowd onto Park Avenue, with hundreds of young people flooding both lanes, stopping traffic, banging on cars and hurling things. Those who refused commands to move up the avenue were tackled and taken into custody.
"That's my friend you're arresting," a teenager yelled at an officer. "That's my boy."
"You want to get arrested too?" an officer replied before grabbing the teenager, taking him to the ground and putting him in zip-tie cuffs.
The police pushed a group of young people up the avenue, moving up a block at a time every few minutes as several helicopters hovered overhead.
At 19th Street, a crowd of those being driven north collectively took a knee and started a "Black Lives Matter" chant. At 20th Street, they sat on wicker chairs outside an upscale restaurant as employees locked the doors and looked on from inside. At 22nd, dozens of teenagers stormed through a CVS store, grabbing water bottles, candy and snacks and then distributing them to others in the crowd.
"When we started clearing the young people out here, the young people ran through the streets of the city, taking plates off of people who were outside dining," Chief Maddrey said.
Officers gave the crowd several chances to leave the area before making arrests, the chief said. Officers loaded some of those they had detained onto a city bus, which itself came under attack as people tried to free those who were being taken away.
Mr. Cenat was taken to safety, and police officials were considering whether to file charges against him related to "inciting a riot," Chief Maddrey said.
"This shows the power of social media and the danger of social media," he said.
One of those in the crowd, Josh Ortiz, who lives in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, said he was at the park to see the two YouTube personalities.
"I just came out because I wanted to see them," Mr. Ortiz, 18, said. "I think a lot of kids thought they could get a free PC or PlayStation and start making money, but I just wanted to see Kai. He's the biggest Black creator in America right now."
He said that things had initially been peaceful but that a few people had "started going crazy."
"It's between bothersome and funny," he said. "There was a big explosion just a second ago, but if you know, like I do, that it's just kids with fireworks, then it gets kind of funny."
Mr. Ortiz said Mr. Cenat deserved some blame for the chaos.
"It's kind of Kai's fault," he said, adding that the event "wasn't planned well" and that Mr. Cenat could have chosen "a more open area."
As the scene in the park unfolded, a large group of teenagers swarmed the entrance of a nearby Best Buy store, prompting workers to lock the doors.
"These guys are huge," said a 21-year-old gamer from Queens who would identify himself only as Zap. He said that 90,000 people had been watching Mr. Cenat's livestream several days ago when he announced the giveaway.
Adam Mass, a 20-year-old student from Brooklyn, said he had come to the park after hearing about the pandemonium.
"I heard they were out here," Mr. Mass said of the two streamers, whom he referred to as a "big deal."
"I didn't even want to get a giveaway," he added. "I knew something was happening, though, so we came here."

He's Finally Coming of Age, And It's a Mighty Struggle: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Directed by Randall Park, this charming comedy about a Japanese American man's belated coming-of-age touches upon fascinating questions of identity but fails to dig below the surface.
"Shortcomings," the directorial debut of the actor Randall Park, opens with a movie-within-the-movie: it's a spoof of "Crazy Rich Asians," playing at an Asian film festival in the Bay Area. As Ben (Justin H. Min), a Japanese American cinephile, and his girlfriend Miko (Ally Maki), a festival organizer, step out of the theater, Ben blasts it as "a garish mainstream rom-com that glorifies the capitalist fantasy of vindication through materialism and wealth."
I nodded enthusiastically. Too bad Ben turns out to be a jerk.
If the meme "the worst person you know just made a great point" were a movie, it would be "Shortcomings." Ben's opinions aren't wrong -- market-tested corporate ploys at diversity do deserve our skepticism, for instance, and the toilet-bowl art of Ben's hipster co-worker (Tavi Gevinson) does deserve the snide laugh it elicits from him -- but he is self-absorbed and fickle. His moping and griping are unearned, lobbed like wet blankets at anyone trying to actually do something with their lives, like Miko, or his best friend, Alice (Sherry Cola).
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Shortcomings" traces the belated coming-of-age of Ben, as Miko abruptly leaves for New York for the summer and Ben fumbles around, dating different women and confronting the looming closure of the art house movie theater where he works. His character arc isn't new: Hollywood has given us numerous stunted heroes who slowly, begrudgingly, come to realize their, err, shortcomings. Where Park's movie, adapted from a 2007 graphic novel by Adrian Tomine, feels fresh is in the way it brings Ben's Asian American identity into the mix. Is his maladjustment a consequence of his experience of otherness, or is he just a regular old man-child?
Ben, for his part, invokes and denies racism opportunistically: He is dismissive when Miko accuses him of ogling white women, but quickly labels her new lover, Leon -- a white man, played hilariously by Timothy Simons, who speaks Japanese and busts out Taekwondo moves -- a "rice king." Ben isn't being fair -- but neither is the scorned date who tells Ben that his lot in life is owed only to him, not to his race. What these arguments get at is the genuine struggle, familiar to people of color, to wrest some agency from a world that tells us who we can and cannot be.
Park's film isn't intrepid enough to really plumb the thorny terrain of that struggle. The movie is funny and touching, with a star-making performance by Min and a script full of lovely, self-aware little touches: When Jacob Batalon, who plays one of Ben's co-workers, derides the "Spider-Man" movies that the actor himself stars in, I chuckled. But it's shot like a sitcom -- flat, shiny, perfunctory -- and structured like one, too, with quip-heavy vignettes that resolve in pat conclusions. Ben surely deserves his comeuppance, but "Shortcomings" traces too neat a narrative journey to that end, leaving a trail of unexplored questions and missed opportunities in its wake.

Studios Shift In Bid to Talk With Writers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The actors' union has historically been more willing to negotiate, but when Fran Drescher took a hard line as its leader, executives shifted their focus to the other striking guild.
When the Writers Guild of America told its members on Tuesday night that movie and television studios had asked for "a meeting this Friday to discuss negotiations," it was the first sign of movement in a stalemate that had begun in early May.
It also signaled a shift in strategy for Hollywood executives working behind the scenes to resolve dual union strikes that have ground the vast entertainment industry to a halt.
The 11,500 screenwriters represented by the Writers Guild went on strike in May after contract negotiations with the studios broke down. Last month, they were joined on the picket lines by tens of thousands of actors after their union, SAG-AFTRA, called a strike. Both unions are worried about not receiving a fair share of the spoils of a streaming-dominated future, among other issues.
Faced with navigating a two-front labor war, the studios at first remained focused on the actors. If that strike could be resolved relatively quickly, at least cameras could start rolling again on movies and shows that are past the writing stage, or so the thinking went. Crucially, actors would also be able to rejoin the publicity circuit for already-finished projects. (During a strike, SAG-AFTRA forbids promotional interviews, social media posts and red carpet appearances.)
The actors' guild has historically been more willing to negotiate with the studios, while the writers have taken a much harder line. Members of the Writers Guild have walked out several times through the decades, most recently in a 100-day strike that ended in 2008. The actors had last gone on strike in 1980.
Over the past week and a half, however, the companies reconsidered that thinking, according to three studio chairs, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the labor situation. The primary reason: Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA.
Ms. Drescher, the former star and co-creator of the 1990s sitcom "The Nanny," has launched broadsides at studio executives, including Disney's chief, Robert A. Iger. Her sharp criticism of studios started at a news conference on July 13 and continued on picket lines over the next week. On Tuesday, she revved up the SAG-AFTRA membership anew, appearing at a New York City Council meeting and nearby rally. She called studio executives "greed-driven and disrespectful people."
SAG-AFTRA did not respond to a request for comment.
Studios decided there could be a path forward with the Writers Guild after a small, informal meeting at a home in Los Angeles last Wednesday, the studio chairs said. A handful of executives met with three members of the guild's negotiating committee, with senior showrunners helping to arrange the sit-down through back channels.
No negotiating took place, but the studio executives came away thinking that there could be a path to a deal, said a labor lawyer who was briefed on the meeting and discussed the private gathering on the condition of anonymity.
A spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, declined to comment. A representative for the Writers Guild also declined to comment.
A broader group of studio leaders convened on Zoom on Friday, the lawyer said. This session included Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, the chairs of Disney Entertainment; Donna Langley, the chair of the NBCUniversal Studio Group; Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-chief executive; and Tony Vinciquerra, the chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment.
There continued to be disagreement over how to handle certain Writers Guild demands, including staffing minimums in TV show writers' rooms. But some of the moguls -- notably Mr. Vinciquerra, the labor lawyer said -- pushed the group to move quickly to make a formal overture to the union.
Carol Lombardini, the lead negotiator for the studio alliance, called her counterpart at the Writers Guild on Tuesday. They agreed to meet in person on Friday to discuss a return to the bargaining table.
The three studio chiefs emphasized that discussions about how to resolve the standoff with SAG-AFTRA were also taking place. Pressure has been increasing from multiple directions -- agents, local elected officials, some of Hollywood's other unions -- to reach agreements with both the actors and the writers by Labor Day.
The writers and actors went on strike after they raised concerns about their compensation and working conditions now that streaming content is affecting all corners of entertainment. The writers' union has called its grievances "existential." In a video address to members last week, Chris Keyser, a chair of the Writers Guild negotiating committee, said writers of all stripes had, for some time, been "fighting for survival."
But in those same remarks, Mr. Keyser offered a self-described "olive branch" to the studios.
"If you are visionaries, envision a solution, not a stalemate," he said, addressing the studio chiefs. "Because this isn't a war we're in -- it's a negotiation. It's just a negotiation. And when you come to remember that again, we will be here as we have been here all along."
Mr. Keyser also said the writers remained unified.
"You cannot outlast us -- you cannot," he said. "And not just because we have the will. Because we have power. Nothing in this business happens until we start to write, and we will not start to write until we are paid."
When the writers first went on strike, the companies essentially turned away from them and focused on separate contract negotiations with the Directors Guild of America and the actors. Hammer out new agreements with them, or so the thinking went, and the Writers Guild, viewed as the most zealous of the three unions, would be boxed in, making its leaders more willing to bargain. It was a playbook that worked the last time the writers went on strike.
Studios reached an agreement with the directors' union in early June. So far, so good. But then came an unexpected plot twist: The actors' union angrily broke off talks in mid-July and joined writers on picket lines.
Since then, the clamor from actors has been relentless. On Wednesday, the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, a charity that is associated with the union but run separately, announced that Meryl Streep and George Clooney had helped raise $ 15 million for workaday actors in need of financial assistance. In a statement, Ms. Streep said, "We will stand strong together against these powerful corporations who are bent on taking the humanity, the human dignity, even the human out of our profession."
Jeffrey Ruthizer, who spent 40 years as a labor negotiator at Disney, ABC and NBC and recently wrote a book, "Labor Pains," described the stalemate as an "all-out war," adding that he had never "seen it this bad." He noted that leaders of the actors' union had asked members to authorize a strike before negotiations even began.
"That's highly unusual," Mr. Ruthizer said. "You don't stoke fear of a strike before sitting down. Once you inflame the passions, you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube."

Full text: Ken Jaworowski edits features for The Times print edition. His debut novel, "Small Town Sins," is due out on Aug. 1. While writing the thriller he listened to hours of excellent music and savored many wonderful stories. Here are a few of them.
The War on Drugs
Though they've won a Grammy (in 2018 for best rock album), this band seems like an insider secret, with its smart yet unpretentious synth-jam tunes. My favorites are "Under the Pressure," which clocks in at nearly nine minutes, and "Burning," at almost six. I'm still not sure I like the band's name. But I'm certain I like its sound.
Living
When I first learned of this 2022 remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1952 masterpiece, "Ikiru," I cringed. Then I saw it and my heart broke. Bill Nighy's subtle performance and Kazuo Ishiguro's gentle script err on the side of understatement as they tell the tale of a dying British bureaucrat and his final wish. See it and weep.
WXPN
Traditional radio is in a sad state, particularly when it comes to indie music, but WXPN is a happy exception. This free, listener-supported station, which is available everywhere via app, online or smart speaker, has introduced me to artists like Neko Case, Lord Huron, Band of Horses and Best Coast. More discoveries await.
The Collected Stories
William Trevor's works have haunted me for years. In a few sentences, he can outline an entire life or evoke a well of emotion. Many of his stories center on the lonely, the damaged and the lost, yet these characters carry on, often using slight smiles to mask deep sadness.
The Rider
The writer and director Chloé Zhao won praise and Oscars for "Nomadland." Yet her previous film, "The Rider," feels unjustly overlooked. It's a quiet, poetic tale of a rodeo rider who must rethink his life after a terrible injury. I saw the film when it came out in 2018 and still find myself encouraging others to watch it.

Sony Delays Movie Releases as Strike by Actors' Union Upends Publicity Plans: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The union has barred members from publicizing their work, and without red carpets and the buzz machine in full swing, other studios are likely to follow.
Hollywood studios, scrambling to contend with a strike by unionized actors, have started to remove big-budget movies from the 2023 release calendar, newly imperiling theaters and undoubtedly irritating fans.
Sony Pictures Entertainment on Friday pushed back the release of two major films that had been set to arrive in theaters by the end of the year -- the Marvel Comics-based "Kraven the Hunter" and a sequel to "Ghostbusters: Afterlife."
In addition, Sony is postponing some of its big 2024 releases. "Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse," is no longer on track for a March premiere, and a new "Karate Kid" will no longer arrive in June.
Until now, the 2023 theatrical release schedule had been left relatively unscathed by the actors' strike, which started on July 14. But other studios are likely to follow Sony's lead. Warner Bros. has been debating whether to postpone "Dune: Part Two," which is supposed to arrive in theaters on Nov. 3. "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom," a big-budget superhero sequel, and "The Color Purple," based on the Broadway musical, are among other 2023 holiday-season movies that could be delayed.
It's not that the studios need striking actors on set -- most of these films are finished or nearly so. Rather, they are worried about a lack of stars to promote them.
Until the strike is resolved, SAG-AFTRA, as the actors' union in known, has barred its members from engaging in any publicity efforts for films and TV shows that have already been completed. That means no red carpet appearances, no social media posts, no interviews on morning news shows and no participation in newspaper or magazine articles.
Searchlight Pictures, the art house studio, on Monday postponed "Poor Things," a surreal science-fiction romance, citing the publicity ban. The film, which stars Emma Stone as a Frankenstein-like monster, will arrive in December instead of September. Last week, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer moved "Challengers," a sex-infused sports drama starring Zendaya, to April from September for the same reason.
SAG-AFTRA has said it is willing to remain on strike until next year in pursuit of better pay from streaming services, protections around artificial intelligence and other gains. No talks are scheduled. About 11,500 movie and television writers are also on strike.
The thinning of the fall release schedule is troubling for a movie theater industry that has only recently shown signs of recovering from the pandemic. "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer," released last weekend, powered the box office to its highest total since 2019.
Large multiplex chains like AMC and Cinemark have repeatedly said that a steady flow of big movies is crucial to the health of their business. Moviegoing begets moviegoing, with trailers for coming releases that play before audiences one weekend filling seats the next. During the pandemic, the supply of movies dropped sharply, and it has only recently returned to 2019 levels.
With fewer movies to show, some theaters have gone out of business. The United States and Canada lost 2,220 movie screens between 2019 and 2023, according to a report by the Cinema Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade organization. (42,063 screens remain.) Cineworld, which owns the Regal chain, has been operating in bankruptcy for nearly a year.
Cineworld said on Friday that it could emerge from Chapter 11 reorganization by the end of the month. Now comes a new threat.
If union walkouts in Hollywood drag into September, theaters will also face a sparse 2024. Multiple movies scheduled for release next year had to stop shooting when actors went on strike. To make the films' 2024 release dates, cameras need to start rolling again relatively soon.
For now, however, next year's release calendar is more crowded than ever. Sony's new 2024 slate includes the Marvel Comics-based "Madame Web" (February), the "Ghostbusters" sequel (March), a "Bad Boys" sequel (June), a "Venom" sequel (July), "Kraven the Hunter" (August) and "Karate Kid" (December).
"Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse," the animated follow-up to "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse," which collected $ 677 million worldwide earlier this year, was not given a new release date.

Full text: Almost all climate finance focuses on mitigating climate change. But money is increasingly pouring in to helping people adapt to the effects of global warming.
Good morning. In today's newsletter: Extreme heat highlights the need for another kind of climate investment; A.I. puts shadow libraries in the spotlight; and Aly Wagner, a co-founder of a new women's soccer team, talks about the money in women's sports. (Was this newsletter forwarded to you? Sign up here. )
As heat waves gripped three continents this week, venturing outside for even a few minutes in Phoenix, Rome or a town in northwest China at times meant risking heatstroke or worse. This weekend, about 80 million Americans are expected to experience a heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the body -- of at least 105 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.
The extreme heat is prompting violent typhoons in Asia and flash floods in the United States. It's taxing power grids, driving up health care costs and messing with tourists' holidays. And it's eventually going to impact everything -- and the business of everything.
El Niño and a stagnant jet stream contributed to the record-breaking temperatures. But to the pragmatist, extreme heat is the new normal.
Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, the head of climate science at Climate Analytics, a policy institute in Berlin, said, "Most of our cities are not equipped to deal with these kinds of summers."
"We'll have to develop adaptation strategies" -- and fast, he told DealBook.
The good news: Investors are spending big on climate projects. Global warming helps make periods of extreme heat more frequent, longer and more intense, and it will continue getting worse unless humans essentially stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, scientists say. Venture investing in climate tech has boomed since the post-Covid recovery began (though it fell, along with venture funding overall, in the first half of the year). And global public and private investment in climate finance, on projects ranging from decarbonizing architecture and transport to developing renewable energy initiatives, more than doubled from 2011 to 2021, to an estimated $ 850 billion, according to the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit climate advocacy group. (It will top $ 1 trillion with the passage of the Biden administration's sweeping climate bills, the European Union's Green Deal and China's low-carbon development initiatives announced in its latest five-year plan.)
"There's been huge, huge progress" in developing green technologies and bringing down their costs, said Bella Tonkonogy, the U.S. director of Climate Policy Initiative whose funders include the Bloomberg Foundation and the German government.
The less good news: Addressing a source of the problem is no longer enough. The effects have arrived, and extreme heat has become the leading weather-related killer in much of the world. Some cities, homeowners and businesses are investing in low-cost hacks that can help make cities, which tend to absorb and re-emit heat more than natural landscapes, more bearable in the summer. Painting roofs white or another reflective color can cool structures down, making air conditioning units as much as 15 percent more energy-efficient, said Jane Gilbert, the chief heat officer of Miami-Dade County, Fla. Homes and businesses have to be retrofitted to stay cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, and Miami-Dade has secured millions in federal funding for that plan. Planting trees also adds vital shade to reduce temperatures on city streets.
Only about 7 percent of climate finance is focused on adaptation efforts, according to the Climate Policy Initiative. But more investors are becoming interested, Ms. Tonkonogy said. Last year, the organization partnered with LightSmith Group, a private equity firm, on a $ 186 million climate fund designed to finance climate resilience projects that could help communities adapt to and withstand the kinds of the extreme weather events that have become so frequent this summer.
"The reason that people are investing more in climate adaptation is because they're actually seeing the impacts of climate change," Ms. Tonkonogy said. -- Bernhard Warner
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Microsoft moves closer to sealing its $ 69 billion deal for Activision Blizzard. The F.T.C. withdrew its in-house case against the acquisition, and Britain's antitrust regulator is reconsidering its decision to block the deal. Microsoft also signed a truce with Sony, one of the biggest opponents to the deal, by agreeing to keep Call of Duty on the Japanese firm's PlayStation console for a decade after the acquisition closes.
BlackRock U-turn? The investment firm appointed Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Aramco, the Saudi oil giant, to its board. The decision was criticized by some as a hypocritical, given the public commitments made by Larry Fink, BlackRock's chief executive, to E.S.G. principles and advoacy for decarbonization. But the U.S. company said Nasser understood "the global energy industry and the drivers of the shift towards a low carbon economy."
A venture capital titan exits. Michael Moritz is set to leave Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm, after a career as one of Silicon Valley's most successful investors. The Welsh-American former journalist backed companies including Google, Yahoo, YouTube and PayPal, earning him a reputation for spotting businesses that go on to become global giants and profiting handsomely.
"Barbenheimer" shakes up the box office. The movie business is gearing up for what is expected to be one of its best weekends in years. The reason? Two very different movies that many people plan to see back-to-back: "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer." Consumers have bought more than 200,000 tickets to watch the double-feature, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners, the industry lobby group.
A.I. brings shadow libraries into the spotlight
Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the artificial intelligence systems that power tools like ChatGPT, are developed using enormous libraries of text. Books are considered especially useful training material, because they're lengthy and (hopefully) well-written. But authors are starting to push back against their work being used this way.
This week, more than 9,000 authors, including Margaret Atwood and James Patterson, called on tech executives to stop training their tools on writers' work without compensation.
That campaign has cast a spotlight on an arcane part of the internet: so-called shadow libraries, like Library Genesis, Z-Library or Bibliotik, that are obscure repositories storing millions of titles, in many cases without permission -- and are often used as A.I. training data.
A.I. companies have acknowledged in research papers that they rely on shadow libraries. OpenAI's GPT-1 was trained on BookCorpus, which has over 7,000 unpublished titles scraped from the self-publishing platform Smashwords.
To train GPT-3, OpenAI said that about 16 percent of the data it used came from two "internet-based books corpora" that it called "Books1" and "Books2." According to a lawsuit by the comedian Sarah Silverman and two other authors against OpenAI, Books2 is most likely a "flagrantly illegal" shadow library.
These sites have been under scrutiny for some time. The Authors Guild, which organized the authors' open letter to tech executives, cited studies in 2016 and 2017 that suggested text piracy depressed legitimate book sales by as much as 14 percent.
Efforts to shut down these sites have floundered. Last year, the F.B.I., with help from the Authors Guild, charged two people accused of running Z-Library with copyright infringement, fraud and money laundering. But afterward, some of these sites were moved to the dark web and torrent sites, making it harder to trace them. And because many of these sites are run outside the United States and anonymously, actually punishing the operators is a tall task.
Tech companies are becoming more tight-lipped about the data used to train their systems. This week, Meta researchers published a paper on Llama 2, the company's L.L.M., that described using only a "new mix of data from publicly available sources." In a research paper on GPT-4 published in March, OpenAI explicitly noted that it wasn't revealing anything about how it trained the L.L.M., citing "the competitive landscape" and "safety considerations."
A soccer star and co-founder on the money in women's sports
The Women's World Cup kicked off in New Zealand this week against a backdrop of booming investor interest in women's sports. As women's leagues draw record crowds, and larger (if not equal) sponsorships, investors are pouring money into an industry they say has been under-marketed and underinvested in -- betting on growth as social media and streaming make the prime time spotlight less singularly powerful.
Aly Wagner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, helped raise a record $ 53 million from funds, led by Sixth Street, for Bay FC, a new Bay Area soccer team, this year. DealBook spoke with her from New Zealand, where she is the lead analyst of the Women's World Cup at Fox, about the business case behind these investments. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Sponsorship dollars still aren't equal. Why is that?
There's just a lot more assets and a lot more teams that you can partner with on the men's side than you can on the women's side.
But the other part of it is that women's sports have been an undervalued asset for way too long. It's a massive opportunity for a lot of these brands to now have great visibility for target markets at probably a discount from what you would get on the men's side.
Two prior efforts to launch new women's teams in the Bay Area folded. Why will Bay FC, which you co-founded, succeed?
Because, while it was incredible what some of the previous iterations of professional women's football did in the Bay Area, that really wasn't a business proposition. It wasn't looked at as there was going to be R.O.I. and that this was something valuable and worth holding onto as a long-term asset. This was looked at as a moral cause.
And yet, media rights still lag far behind. Apple recently signed a 10-year, $ 2.5 billion deal with Major League Soccer. The National Women's Soccer League's deal with CBS, which was signed in 2020, was worth $ 4.5 million over three years. How important is parity to R.O.I.?
Media is massive. It's one of the biggest levers you can pull in terms of the revenue for the different clubs. What's interesting about our timing, though, is the media game itself is changing. Would you want to be equal from Day 1? Sure. But what is equal? M.L.S. has been around for how many years? How many eyeballs do they put on their sport? They went behind a paywall. Has that been challenging? Probably.
As the media game changes, I think we can get really creative, and because we're a new league, we can be nimble in that regard.
Alex Ohanian called underinvestment in women's sport "a legacy of gross business incompetence ." Is it simply sexism, or something more nuanced?
Culturally, we're all raised with certain narratives -- some of them conscious, some of them unconscious. I think the biggest hurdle that we've had to overcome is just that a lot of the world believes in seeing things before they believe them. Men were playing sports long before women were at a competitive level, right? And long before it became an investment opportunity. And so we were just behind in that evolution.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Peacock's new show indulges in the same ultraviolence as the video game that inspired it. But this time it has a message about the haves and the have-nots.
When Stephanie Beatriz likes a script she enjoys reading it aloud at home to get a better feel for the character and story. She warmed up quickly to "Twisted Metal," the new Peacock mayhem machine based on the popular PlayStation game series that first burned rubber in 1995. But as she turned the pages, encountering psycho clowns, murderous religious cults, cannibalism and other manner of good times, she had to pause. Her 8-month-old daughter was in the room.
In a June video interview she recalled what she told her husband: "I'm going to take a break and stop because I'm not sure that this is great for her subconscious."
Her concern was well-founded. Premiering July 27, "Twisted Metal" is nothing if not extreme. Fast and profane, it is fueled by what "A Clockwork Orange" once called a bit of the old ultraviolence. It is blood-soaked, bullet-ridden and chaotic. In one early scene, two men sit in massive tubs, waiting to be cooked and served. One of them is sprinkled with a generous portion of lemon pepper spice as a human foot dangles from a line; Ol' Dirty Bastard's "Shimmy Shimmy Ya" ("Ooh, baby, I like it raw") blares on the soundtrack.
Starring Anthony Mackie as John Doe, a wiz behind the wheel hired to deliver a mystery package across a hazardous, postapocalyptic America, and Beatriz as Quiet, his no-nonsense, vengeance-minded passenger, "Twisted Metal" stakes out a sometimes-queasy intersection between terror and glee. It's a little like "Mad Max" on laughing gas.
"It's a very weird apocalypse," Marc Forman, an executive producer, said. "It's crawling with cannibals and weird cults. What's great is that you never know what's around the corner."
There's very little that is old fashioned about "Twisted Metal," yet it has a fair amount of nostalgia in the tank -- for both the pre-apocalyptic world, and for an earlier age of gaming. The story is set in the wake of a hazily defined, world-destroying event that occurred in 2002, freezing culture as the characters know it in that year. An evil interrogator uses the late '90s Europop earworm "Barbie Girl" to torture his prisoners.
As Mackie's John drives his beat-up 2002 Subaru through a dilapidated shopping mall, he's excited to see the remnants of a Foot Locker (he grabs some kicks as he races by). A Twisted Metal game cartridge falls onto his windshield; he looks at it quizzically.
Mackie, 44, recalled playing the earliest versions of Twisted Metal. "I remember it just being destruction," he said in a June phone interview as he sat, ironically, in traffic. "The game was just demolition derby, and I loved it, but it was impossible to play. You couldn't control the cars -- you were just flying past each other, shooting missiles and hoping they hit."
The playing experience advanced, along with the rest of the gaming industry, through subsequent iterations. Now "Twisted Metal" is just the latest TV series hoping to translate gaming popularity to small-screen success, following in the footsteps of series like Netflix's "The Witcher" and HBO's abundantly Emmy-nominated hit "The Last of Us."
In gaming circles, "Twisted Metal" belongs to the genre of "vehicular combat." The game isn't big on narrative. The series's creative team, including the showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith and the writer-executive producers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (both writers on the "Deadpool" movies), were charged with expanding the game's world to the scale of a TV show -- to take it beyond, in Mackie's words, "just being destruction." (PlayStation Productions and its corporate cousin Sony Pictures Television produced the series along with Universal Television.)
Some characters exist in both Twisted Metal mediums, including the psychotic clown Sweet Tooth, perhaps the show's most macabre creation. A bare-chested hulk with a leering clown mask -- he is played by the body of the wrestler Joe Seanoa paired with the voice of the actor Will Arnett -- Sweet Tooth controls what is left of Las Vegas, driving what appears to be a refurbished ice cream truck and wielding a machete that he uses to slash open all comers.
At one point he assembles a ragtag army of outcasts to do his bidding, giving him a literal insane clown posse. But Sweet Tooth has one thing in common with John and Quiet: an enmity for Agent Stone (a platinum-dyed Thomas Haden Church), a petty tyrant who essentially runs the country.
Somehow, amid all the mayhem, "Twisted Metal" finds room for contemporary class consciousness. John has been tasked with a cross-country trip, from New San Francisco to New Chicago and back, with the promise of a cozy life by the bay if he succeeds. New San Francisco is a walled urban paradise where the swells dwell, while throughout most of the country, it's a mad scramble to survive. Inside the wall you can eat dinner. Outside, you might be dinner.
"The metaphors abound," Beatriz ("Brooklyn Nine-Nine") said. "It is silly, it is violent, it is funny. But so much of the show is about who has and who doesn't. There's an argument to be made that there's a certain kind of cannibalism happening now, within our society, at all times."
But fans of the Twisted Metal game needn't worry that their beloved bedlam has gone highbrow. The series's bread and butter remains people shooting and slicing each other to pieces, often while driving cars equipped to do the same. This is car culture at the end of the world, a land of last resorts. So it seems appropriate that John drives not a souped-up sports car but a true beater, modified to handle the wear and tear of the apocalypse. John's true love in "Twisted Metal" isn't Quiet, but Evelyn -- or, as her license plate reads, EV3L1N.
Mackie can relate. After his breakout performance in "We Are Marshall," from 2006, he was able to purchase his dream car: a 1964 ½ Ford Mustang (as the earliest Mustang models are known by enthusiasts). He's been tinkering with it ever since. The car's name is Marshall.
"Me and Marshall are always cruising and enjoying our time together," Mackie said. "Before I had my sons, Marshall was like my best friend. Some people talk to their plants, some people talk to their cats. I would talk to my car."
Beatriz had a slightly different automotive coming-of-age. She was acting in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival when she started thinking of moving to Los Angeles. One problem: She didn't know how to drive, and a car is a must in L.A. So she learned from a friend and fellow Shakespearean, Catherine E. Coulson, perhaps best known as the Log Lady in "Twin Peaks." Coulson would take Beatriz around Ashland, Ore., where the festival was located, in her Prius, a far more fanciful image than any you will see in "Twisted Metal."
Beatriz's maiden voyages with the Log Lady have given way to faster adventures: She was grand marshal for the Indianapolis 500 in May. As part of the gig she got to ride shotgun in an Indy car before the race, hitting speeds of 190 miles per hour. "Could have gone faster, would've been great," she said.
All that fun, and not a killer clown in sight.

With Federal Reins Loose, Big Business Gets Bigger: [briefing]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The U.S. government is struggling to crack down on corporate concentration.
When President Biden took office, he sent several signals that he was ready to take on increasing corporate concentration. Among the clearest was appointing the consumer advocate Lina Khan -- a prominent critic of monopoly power -- to lead the Federal Trade Commission.
Instead, the takeovers have persisted under Biden's watch. Last week brought the latest evidence that reducing corporate concentration will be more difficult than Biden might have hoped: U.S. courts rejected the F.T.C.'s attempts to block Microsoft from absorbing the video game company Activision Blizzard. Microsoft could finalize the deal in the coming months; a key deadline was extended this week.
The merger would be by far the biggest ever in video games, after adjusting for inflation. The game industry now accounts for significant chunks of the economy. It is larger than music, U.S. book publishing and North American sports combined. Microsoft's game division and Activision Blizzard each make more money annually than all U.S. movie theaters. The two companies are among the biggest in games, as this chart by my colleague Ashley Wu shows:
The F.T.C. said that the Microsoft-Activision merger was anticompetitive and sued to stop it. The agency argued that the merger would give Microsoft, maker of the game console Xbox, too big of an advantage over its rival Sony, the maker of PlayStation. Of particular interest was Activision's massive franchise, Call of Duty. A new edition of Call of Duty is consistently one of the best-selling games on Xbox and PlayStation each year. But if Microsoft owns Call of Duty, it could make the game exclusive to Xbox and rob Sony of one of gaming's biggest attractions.
To address those concerns, Microsoft promised that it would put Call of Duty games on PlayStations for 10 more years. That was one reason the courts ruled against the F.T.C.: They found the agency had not shown that the deal would likely hurt competition.
With their ruling, the courts are allowing another big merger that will further consolidate a major industry. Many experts say that trend is ultimately hurting consumers by diminishing the kind of competition that lowers prices and improves quality for goods and services, even if the F.T.C. wasn't able to prove all of that in this case.
Concentrated power
Let's zoom out. In the past several decades, markets have become more concentrated. The very biggest companies dominate most industries, as this chart shows:
Why does this matter? In simple terms, a lack of competition lets companies lower wages, increase prices and dilute the quality of their products. A classic example is internet service: Many Americans live in places with only one or two providers. These companies keep prices high, the internet can be spotty and the customer service is often bad. Since customers don't have alternatives, providers can get away with those faults.
Corporate concentration deepens that kind of problem, experts say. One economist concluded that market concentration costs the typical American household more than $ 5,000 a year. Progressives like Khan have argued that regulators need to take the issue more seriously.
Courts push back
The Biden administration released guidelines this week that seek to toughen antitrust law, which restricts anticompetitive practices. Under Khan, the F.T.C. has also pushed courts to effectively lower the burden of proof required to show that a merger is anticompetitive. There is merit to that approach, some experts argue: U.S. courts have raised the bar very high over the past few decades, surpassing standards in the U.K. and much of Europe.
"We can convict someone and send him to prison for murder on the basis of circumstantial evidence," said Douglas Melamed, an expert on antitrust issues at Stanford Law School. "But it often seems that courts will not let plaintiffs win an antitrust case based on circumstantial evidence."
The F.T.C. has yet to persuade the courts to ease their standards. The agency's loss in the Microsoft-Activision case is the latest example. It also failed to block Meta's acquisition of a virtual reality firm, Within. And it has even lost in its own administrative court, which ruled in favor of the gene-sequencing company Illumina in its acquisition of the firm Grail.
Khan's cause still has potential. The last major shift in antitrust law, in the 1970s, came after decades of work by conservatives to push the law and courts in their direction. The movement that Khan helped popularize among progressives is only a few years old. If it persuades more of the public and, most importantly, judges, it could eventually succeed.
Related: The F.T.C.'s defeats have prompted fresh questions about Khan's strategy. "All these court losses are making their threats look more like a paper tiger," one chief executive said.

Microsoft and Activision Delay Deal to Work Out Regulatory Issues: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The extension is most likely a signal that the companies believe they will eventually receive needed approvals.
Microsoft and Activision Blizzard said on Wednesday that they were delaying a $ 69 billion merger as the two companies scrambled to get final approval from British antitrust regulators.
The new extension, set for Oct. 18, signals that the companies believe they will complete the deal but need more time to satisfy regulators' concerns.
When Microsoft announced its plans to acquire Activision, a video game publisher, in early 2022, the two companies set a deadline of July 18 this year to close the deal. The revised agreement introduced an escalating breakup fee that Microsoft would have to pay to Activision if the purchase fell through, from $ 3 billion until Aug. 29, then growing to as much as $ 4.5 billion if it did not close by Sept. 15.
"We are confident about our prospects for getting this deal across the finish line," Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.
Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision, said in a statement, "While we continue to have concerns about the economy and growing industry competition, we remain focused on the long-term opportunities ahead and completing our merger with Microsoft."
The antitrust scrutiny has focused on whether consumers will be harmed if Microsoft, which makes the Xbox video game console and has a nascent game streaming platform, also owns the game publisher behind blockbusters like Call of Duty.
Three regulators ended up being the most crucial gatekeepers to the acquisition. The deal received a green light from the European Union in May after Microsoft agreed to offer Activision games on other streaming platforms. But it faced bigger opposition in the United States and Britain.
In December, the Federal Trade Commission sued to oppose the acquisition in the agency's administrative court, arguing that Microsoft could keep Call of Duty off Sony's popular PlayStation console. And in June, the F.T.C. asked a federal judge to postpone the deal while the administrative process proceeded. That judge ruled against the F.T.C. last week, and an appeals court on Friday rejected the agency's request to stop the deal from closing.
The British antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, moved to block the deal in April, saying it could harm consumers who streamed games online. Microsoft and Activision appealed the finding.
Last week, shortly after the federal judge rejected the F.T.C.'s attempt to block the deal, Microsoft, Activision and the British antitrust regulator said they wanted to pause the appeal proceedings to see if they could negotiate an arrangement that resolved regulatory concerns. On Monday, the regulator told the tribunal handling the appeal that there was a "realistic chance" the talks would be successful. The tribunal granted a two-month pause in the appeal.
On Sunday, Microsoft also said it had reached a deal with Sony to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years, which resolved the biggest concern the F.T.C. raised in court. Typically, the F.T.C. withdraws its administrative case if it loses in federal court, but it has not yet backed away from its objections to Microsoft's acquisition plans.

Box Office for Cruise's Film Is Solid but Lags Behind Industry's Lofty Expectations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The seventh film in the 27-year-old movie franchise was No. 1 at the box office, taking in $ 80 million over its first five days. But the movie industry was hoping for more.
Tom Cruise's seventh "Mission: Impossible" spectacle, which arrived in theaters on Wednesday and cost at least $ 400 million to make and market, was supposed to mark a turning point at the troubled summer box office. Death-defying stunts! A new love interest! That thrilling theme song!
Ticket sales were solid. But the spectacular (and perhaps unrealistic) result that Hollywood expected did not materialize, extending concern about the movie capital's overreliance on aging franchises -- and adding to studio dread about what kind of damage the actors' strike might have on the rest of the high-stakes summer slate.
As an added vexation, a low-budget movie from outside the Hollywood system, "Sound of Freedom" (Angel Studios), which some critics have attacked as a recruiting tool for the far right, became a box office phenomenon.
"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One," directed and co-written by Christopher McQuarrie, took in $ 56.2 million over the weekend in the United States and Canada, for a total of about $ 80 million since it opened on Wednesday. Overseas, the two-hour-43-minute movie collected an additional $ 155 million, for a global total of about $ 235 million, according to Paramount Pictures.
Analysts that track moviegoer interest and use complex formulas to forecast ticket sales had predicted that "Dead Reckoning Part One" would generate about $ 250 million worldwide over its first five days, with the United States and Canada contributing at least $ 85 million. "The industry was looking for bigger here," said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers.
"This opening is roughly average for an action thriller at this point in its series," Mr. Gross said about the ultraexpensive "Dead Reckoning Part One," which received sensational reviews. "Of course, there's nothing average about this film."
Mr. Cruise, considered white hot as a box office draw after last year's "Top Gun: Maverick," promoted "Dead Reckoning Part One" with his usual globe-trotting, walking red carpets for premieres in Rome, London, Abu Dhabi, Seoul, Sydney and New York. Early last week, he made surprise appearances in movie theaters at preview screenings in cities like Toronto, Atlanta and Miami.
The blistering promotional campaign for "Dead Reckoning Part One" will be Hollywood's last until a consortium of studios can come to terms with SAG-AFTRA, as the powerful actors' union is known. On Friday, the union went on strike for the first time in 43 years, saying it was fed up with exorbitant pay for entertainment moguls and worried about not receiving a fair share of the spoils of a streaming-dominated future.
In the coming weeks, studios like Universal, Sony and Disney have movies set for release that will have to do without the promotional star power of people like Denzel Washington ("The Equalizer 3"), Owen Wilson and Tiffany Haddish ("Haunted Mansion") and Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx ("Strays").
For the weekend in the United States and Canada, "Dead Reckoning Part One" played on 4,327 screens and was No. 1, with premium-priced IMAX and other large-format venues contributing 37 percent of ticket sales. "Based on exit poll ratings and recommendations, which were out of this world, this was the best-received 'Mission' yet, which speaks volumes about the viability of the franchise," said Chris Aronson, Paramount's president of domestic distribution.
Mr. Aronson made several other glass-half-full observations, including that, over the first five days, "Dead Reckoning Part One" was comfortably outperforming the franchise's previous chapter, "Fallout" (2018), in most countries overseas.
Astoundingly, given its cost (about $ 15 million) and low-wattage marketing campaign, "Sound of Freedom" placed second, taking in $ 27 million from 3,265 standard screens, for a two-week total of $ 86 million. The horror film "Insidious: The Red Door," a similarly low-budget offering from Sony Pictures, finished third, collecting $ 13 million, for a two-week total of $ 58 million.
"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" (Disney-Lucasfilm) epitomized a problem that Hollywood has encountered this summer with franchise spectacles, trundling along behind the top three with about $ 12 million, for a three-week total of $ 145 million ( $ 302 million worldwide).
That's a lot of money, but not nearly enough for a movie that cost at least $ 400 million to make and market. Since box office revenue is split roughly 50-50 between studios and theaters, "Dial of Destiny" would need to be performing more than twice as well for Disney to make money.
Domestic ticket sales total roughly $ 5 billion for the year, down about 20 percent from the same period in 2019, the last year before the pandemic severely disrupted moviegoing. And franchise sequels are part of the reason for the decline. Decades of being pumped for profits have left some of these properties with threadbare tires.
The third "Ant-Man" movie, the 10th "Fast and Furious" chapter, the fifth "Indiana Jones" installment and the 12th ("Shazam! Fury of the Gods") and 13th ("The Flash") films in the DC Extended Universe have all disappointed, certainly in comparison with their costs.
"In general, audiences are interested in more, more, more of the same, until they start getting satisfied and excited about the next thing," Mr. Gross, the box office consultant, wrote in his Sunday newsletter.

F.T.C.'s Chair Criticized Over Antitrust Case Losses: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Lina Khan faced more than three hours of questioning from the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee.
Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, faced more than three hours of criticism and ridicule from Republicans in a House hearing on Thursday, as emboldened critics increasingly put pressure on the agency for its crackdown on the growing power of tech giants.
During the highly partisan hearing, Republicans accused Ms. Khan, who has carried out an aggressive agenda of lawsuits and investigations against tech companies, of "harassing" businesses. The lawmakers, who repeatedly cut off Ms. Khan midsentence, also ridiculed her for the F.T.C.'s recent losses in antitrust cases and for wasting government resources.
"You are now 0 for 4 in merger trials," Representative Kevin Kiley, Republican of California, said at the House Judiciary Committee hearing. "Why are you losing so much?"
The blistering session capped a bruising week that has brought greater scrutiny to the F.T.C. It was Ms. Khan's first public appearance since a judge ruled on Tuesday against the agency's attempt to stop Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision. It was a major defeat in a tech case for the F.T.C. after another judge decided in May against its attempt to block Meta's acquisition of a virtual reality app maker, Within.
Ms. Khan, a legal scholar, has become a lightning rod for her efforts to rein in corporate power and to give the F.T.C. more teeth in enforcement. Since President Biden picked her to lead the agency two years ago, she has said the F.T.C. was too complacent and needed to pursue more lawsuits against companies, even if it did not always win. Even in court losses, she has said, the cases expose the need to update antitrust laws for the digital age.
Ms. Khan's aggressive agenda, which has spanned industries beyond tech, has rattled the agency, where two Republican commissioners and several senior officials have resigned. Christine Wilson, one of the former Republican members, accused Ms. Khan of abusing her power as chair. This month, Mr. Biden nominated the solicitor general for Virginia, Andrew Ferguson, and for Utah, Melissa Holyoak, to fill the Republican seats.
In Thursday's hearing, Ms. Khan, 34, appeared unruffled. She highlighted the F.T.C.'s challenges to mergers in pharmaceutical, semiconductor, defense and energy markets. Many of those challenges did not go to court.
She said she didn't bring cases that she thought would lose but, without referring to the Microsoft case, acknowledged the risks of her strategy.
"We fight hard when we believe there was a law violation, and unfortunately things don't always go our way," Ms. Khan said.
The losses have not weakened her focus on the tech industry. On Thursday, the F.T.C. filed to appeal the court decision on Microsoft's deal with Activision. Also this week, it opened an investigation into the artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot, for potentially harming consumers with privacy and security lapses and for spreading false information about individuals.
Ms. Khan's strategy may take years to pay off, said Megan Gray, a lawyer and a former member of the F.T.C.'s staff. "She knows that this is a long-term effort and this not a Pollyanna new antitrust push," Ms. Gray said.
The White House reiterated its support for Ms. Khan on Thursday. "Chair Khan has delivered results for families, consumers, workers, small businesses and entrepreneurs," Michael Kikukawa, a White House assistant press secretary, said in a statement.
At the hearing, the court loss this week provided more ammunition for Republicans in their complaints against the F.T.C.
Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, criticized Ms. Khan's judgment in pursuing the case to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision. Regulators rarely bring cases against so-called vertical mergers of two companies that don't directly compete. That was the case with Microsoft, a console maker, and Activision, a video game maker. And Sony, Microsoft's competitor, has a big market share, Mr. Issa said.
He also criticized the F.T.C. for pursuing a case to block the pharmaceutical giant Illumina from merging with Grail, a cancer test maker, after a judge in the agency's internal court disagreed with its fight to prevent the deal.
"My problem here today is that you're a bully," Mr. Issa said. "The reality is we are a global market, and you are thinking only of who you want to go after for some reason. And I cannot find your logic."
Representative Jim Jordan, the Republican chair of the Judiciary Committee, accused the agency of "harassing" Twitter in its investigation of the company's security practices. Mr. Jordan, who has accused Democrats of censoring Republican views, has praised Twitter's owner, Elon Musk, for loosening restrictions on speech.
"My concern is the sustained attack on Twitter when the ownership there changed," Mr. Jordan said.
Ms. Khan replied: "We at the F.T.C. have no view on who should or should not own a company. All we care about is that the company is following the law."
Democrats came to Ms. Khan's defense.
Representative Jerrold Nadler from New York, the committee's ranking Democrat, said it was the F.T.C.'s job to investigate Twitter for violating a consent decree that it agreed to more than a decade ago after previous security violations.
"Unfortunately, I expect that today you will be the target of a barrage of personal attacks and wild accusations about the work of the F.T.C. under your leadership," Mr. Nadler said.

When Spider-Man Met Jeff Koons: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Our critic spots references to Hilma af Klint and Lichtenstein in "Across the Spider-Verse." Koons, who inspired the film's creative team, gets top billing with an animated survey (before his work is destroyed).
"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse," the sequel to the 2018 reimagining of the arachnid-adolescent superhero, doubles down on the first installment with an inventive and magpie visual style. The result is, at least in part, a crash course in art history (literally so, as characters frequently crash into works of art).
While the film is largely rendered in computer-generated animation that speeds by at a dizzying clip, there are moments of slowed, even stunning beauty: backgrounds dissolving with painterly effect, shifting into emotive abstraction reminiscent of, at turns, the work of Kandinsky, Mondrian and Hilma af Klint. New York's cityscape is softened into brushy, Impressionistic swaths. Ben-Day dots stutter across the screen, a nod to the story's comic book source material, but also calling up Roy Lichtenstein's appropriations of the same.
Justin K. Thompson, a director of the film, said the collision of techniques and applications was deliberate. "We wanted to emulate dry brush, watercolor, acrylic," he said. "I looked a lot at the work of Paul Klee, the work of Lyonel Feininger." The experimental films of John Whitney, a pioneer of computer animation, were another inspiration.
There are also a number of more direct allusions to contemporary art. An early set piece in the Guggenheim Museum's Frank Lloyd Wright building allowed the filmmakers gleeful abandon. A version of the perennial Spider-Man villain Vulture that appears as if lifted from a Leonardo da Vinci parchment drawing tumbles through the museum's rotunda, wielding weapons inspired by da Vinci's fanciful and terrifying inventions and causing havoc in what quickly appears to be a Jeff Koons retrospective. The fight scene deploys several of Koons's sculptures of inflatable toys, like "Lobster" (2003) and "Dolphin" (2002), hurled as projectiles. Naturally, a Koons Balloon Dog, his most readily recognizable work, receives top billing.
"When we talked about the Balloon Dog we said, 'What could we do with it? What would be special?"' Thompson told me. Koons, he recalled, "was actually the one who said, 'You know, one thing about the Balloon Dog is it's this thing that has a lot to do with breath. It's filled with human breath. But we've never actually seen the inside of one. What if we cut one open and we could see what was inside?' And we just kind of looked at each other, like, 'But what's inside?' And he said, 'Whatever you want."'
What's inside ended up being a sight gag that follows after Vulture lops off the head of a 12-foot-tall Balloon Dog, from which spill countless smaller Balloon Dog sculptures, satisfying the nagging suspicion that Koons's outsize works are in fact elaborate piñatas. (The scene brought to mind an episode earlier this year, where a collector visiting the Art Wynwood fair in Miami accidentally shattered a 16-inch edition. The film was already well through production.)
"It was moving to me," Koons said on a phone call from Hydra, Greece, "because I always thought of the Balloon Dog as kind of a ritualistic work, something that could have a mythic quality to it, a little bit like a Trojan horse or Venus of Willendorf, where there would be some form of tribal community." (His own balloon Venus did not seem to make the final cut.) Koons considered the Balloon Dog's presence in the film as "truly participating in a larger community where people can rally around it."
The scene, which also features several of Koons's earlier, stranger and less exposed works, like the polychromed wood sculpture "String of Puppies" (1988), from the "Banality" series, the stainless steel bust "Louis XIV" (1986), and several of his 1980s vacuum cleaner assemblages, is a homage to an artist who served as the original, if indirect, influence for the first "Spider-Verse" film's direction. In 2014, while still in an early conceptual phase and at an impasse as to how to create a kind of postmodern version of the deathless hero, Phil Lord, a co-writer of the screenplay, and Christopher Miller, a producer, visited the Koons retrospective at the Whitney Museum. Lord has said the exhibition crystallized their thinking.
"You could look at 'The New,' 'Equilibrium,' 'Luxury & Degradation,' 'Antiquity,' 'Hulk Elvis,' all different bodies of work that possibly seem like this kind of multiverse," Koons offered. "Where you could have things existing at the same time but in different ways."
Whether the deep dive into Koons's oeuvre resonates with casual viewers is another story. As the plot swings between slightly overbearing teen angst and extrapolations into quantum physics -- itself an extended metaphor for the angst-inducing, open-ended possibilities of adolescence -- the art in-jokes feel like a concession to adult aesthetes. ("I think it's a Banksy" is a one-liner recycled from the first film, referring to something that looks nothing like a Banksy. Everyone laughed at the joke at the Upper West Side screening I attended, but not at the Koons stuff.)
The idea that, in an alternative universe, Jeff Koons's career booster took place at the Guggenheim instead of the Whitney is perhaps the most in-joke of them all, something even seasoned art-world insiders might not have fully appreciated. "There was a discussion for many years that I would have my retrospective at the Guggenheim -- it never happened," Koons told me. "So it was wonderful to see."
For his part, Koons gushed about the result: "I think the film is really astonishing, and I think culturally it's playing a very important role for a whole generation of young people to inform them about the possibilities of perception." He went on to say, "I never had seen richer colors -- the reds are phenomenal!" Koons was born in '55 and grew up on Disney. "There was a certain point in the '70s maybe where we saw animation fall off," he said, "and then with Pixar we saw this tremendous leap forward. The film uses that technology as a base but brings back a texture, really the texture of the senses. I mean, it's like the way we perceive a Rembrandt or a Titian."
Asked if he was at all disturbed by seeing representations of his work obliterated by animated superheroes, Koons responded with Zen Buddhist diplomacy. "I care very much about the world. I care about living. I care about existence," he said. "Everything turns to dust. The world around us turns to dust, universes turn to dust. What's important is how we can enjoy the world that we're in, and be able to have the perception of what our future can be. As an artist, it's nice to feel in some way that the fine arts are able to participate within culture."

Full text: The dual walkouts pit more than 170,000 workers against old-line studios like Disney and Sony, as well as tech juggernauts like Netflix and Amazon.
The Hollywood actors' union approved a strike on Thursday for the first time in 43 years, bringing the $ 134 billion American movie and television business to a halt over anger about pay and fears of a tech-dominated future.
The leaders of SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 television and movie actors, announced the strike after negotiations with studios over a new contract collapsed, with streaming services and artificial intelligence at the center of the standoff. On Friday, the actors will join screenwriters, who walked off the job in May, on picket lines in New York, Los Angeles and the dozens of other American cities where scripted shows and movies are made.
Actors and screenwriters had not been on strike at the same time since 1960, when Marilyn Monroe was still starring in films and Ronald Reagan was the head of the actors' union. Dual strikes pit more than 170,000 workers against old-line studios like Disney, Universal, Sony and Paramount, as well tech juggernauts like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.
"I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us!" Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA, as the actors' union is known, said at a news conference on Thursday in Los Angeles. "How far apart we are on so many things. How they plead poverty, that they're losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their C.E.O.s. It is disgusting. Shame on them!"
Shaking her fists in anger, Ms. Drescher noted that "the entire business model has been changed" by streaming and that artificial intelligence would soon change it more. "This is a moment in history -- a moment of truth," she said. "At some point, you have to say, 'No, we're not going to take this anymore."'
Many of the actors' demands mirror those of the writers, who belong to the Writers Guild of America. Both unions say they are trying to ensure living wages for workaday members, in particular those making movies or television shows for streaming services.
Screenwriters are afraid studios will use A.I. to generate scripts. Actors worry that the technology could be used to create digital replicas of their likenesses (or that performances could be digitally altered) without payment or approval.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said it had worked to reach a reasonable deal at a difficult time for an industry upended by the streaming revolution, which the pandemic sped up.
"The union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry," the alliance said in a news release that outlined 14 areas where studios had offered "historic" contract improvements. Those included, according to the alliance, an 11 percent pay increase in the contract's first year for background actors, stand-ins and photo doubles and a 76 percent increase in residual payments for "high-budget" shows that stream overseas.
The alliance added in a separate statement: "We are deeply disappointed that SAG-AFTRA has decided to walk away from negotiations. This is the union's choice, not ours."
Behind the scenes, studio executives responded to Ms. Drescher's fury in varying ways. Some said they had underestimated her ability to lead the sometimes-fractious actors' union -- discounting her as little more than the cartoonish figure she played on "The Nanny" for six seasons in the 1990s. Others continued to mock her as giving an Academy Award-caliber performance at the union's news conference.
Though Hollywood had been bracing for a writers' strike since the beginning of the year -- screenwriters have walked out eight times over the past seven decades, most recently in 2007 -- the actors' uncharacteristic resolve caught senior executives and producers off guard.
The actors last staged a major walkout in 1980, when the economic particulars of a still-nascent boom in home video rentals and sales was a sticking point. Their latest action is part of a resurgent labor movement, particularly in California, where hotel workers, school bus drivers, teachers and cafeteria staff have all gone on strike for some duration in recent months.
The first distress signal for the studios came in early June when roughly 65,000 members of the actors' union voted to authorize a strike. Almost 98 percent of the voters supported the authorization, a figure that narrowly eclipsed the writers' margin.
Still, studio negotiators went into the talks feeling optimistic. They were taken aback when they saw the list of proposals from the union -- it totaled 48 pages, nearly triple the size of the list during their last negotiations in 2020, according to two people familiar with the proposals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential talks.
Then in late June, more than 1,000 actors, including Meryl Streep, John Leguizamo, Jennifer Lawrence, Constance Wu and Ben Stiller, signed a letter to guild leadership, declaring pointedly that "we are prepared to strike."
The Hollywood studios will now need to navigate a two-front labor war with no modern playbook to consult. There are many open questions, including whether the actors and the writers may demand that future negotiations with the studios be conducted in tandem. One guild that will not be included: the Directors Guild of America, which ratified a contract last month.
The actors' walkout will provide an immediate boon to the striking writers, who have been walking picket lines for more than 70 days; the Writers Guild has yet to return to bargaining with the studios. Now those picket lines are likely to be raucous and star-studded spectacles -- struggling thespians still trying to get a foothold next to A-listers with bodyguards who are paid $ 20 million or more per movie role.
The strikes are the latest monumental blow to an entertainment industry that has been rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.
The Hollywood studios have watched their share prices nose-dive and their profit margins shrink as viewership for cable and network television -- as well as box office returns -- has collapsed in the wake of the explosive growth of streaming entertainment.
Many companies have resorted to layoffs, as well as purging series from their streaming services, all in the name of trying to increase profit margins and satisfy recalcitrant investors. Studio executives had already put the brakes on ordering new television series last year as their streaming services continued to burn through cash.
In an interview on CNBC on Thursday morning, Disney's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said that given all the "disruptive forces" in the business, "this is worst time in the world to add to that disruption."
Barry Diller, the veteran media executive, said in an interview that the recent upheaval in the industry had caused distress for both sides.
"You have a complete change in the underlying economics of the entertainment business that it previously held for certainly the last 50 years, if not the last 100 years," he said. "Everything was basically in balance under the hegemony of five major studios, and then, oh, my God, along come the tech companies in Netflix, Amazon and Apple and the fast, transformative things that came out of Covid. The result of which is you have a business that's just completely upended."
After the strike announcement, the union issued rules for its members. Along with not being able to work in front of the camera, they will not be permitted to promote current projects. That includes attending Comic-Con, film festivals and movie premieres.
That means actors will not be able to promote movies during an all-important stretch for the summer box office, when big-budget films like "Barbie," "Oppenheimer" and "Haunted Mansion" are released.
Some of those promotional opportunities have already disappeared: Late-night shows like "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" have been running only repeat episodes during the writers' strike.
The effects of the dual strikes should be noticeable to viewers within a couple of months. Unless there is an immediate resolution to the labor disputes, the ABC fall schedule, for instance, will debut with nightly lineups of reality series and game shows -- including "Celebrity Wheel of Fortune," "Dancing With the Stars" and "Judge Steve Harvey" -- as well as repeats of "Abbott Elementary."
If the strikes drag into the fall, blockbuster films scheduled to be released next summer, like "Deadpool 3," could be delayed.

Full text: Set in 1967 Dublin, this mild-mannered comedy explores grief and grievances with an ensemble that includes Maggie Smith, Kathy Bates and Laura Linney.
A camera soars above Dublin then glides toward a promontory where a solitary figure stands in front of a memorial plaque. A frothy score wrangles our emotions. Don't get too sad, it seems to say, before the camera closes in on a sorrowful Lily Fox (Maggie Smith).
Set in 1967, "The Miracle Club," directed by Thaddeus O'Sullivan, touches on grief and grievances, on unwanted pregnancies and the Catholic Church, while wearing the guise of a redemptive romp. It's a delicate balance that -- even with the impressive triumvirate of Smith, Kathy Bates and Laura Linney -- the movie doesn't always sustain.
Lily's sojourn is one of multiple pilgrimages in the movie. The central journey takes Lily and her two closest friends, plus the estranged daughter of a recently departed third, to Lourdes, France, where miracles are sought by masses of people each year. Agnes O'Casey plays Dolly, the youngest of the trio and the mother of a boy (Eric D. Smith) who seems unable to speak. But Dolly is not the only member of the group in need of a miracle.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
With her taut mouth and vigilant gaze, Linney is especially nuanced as Chrissie, the wounded but self-contained and observant interloper who returns from the United States after a 40-year rift. And amid the star power, O'Casey is something of a revelation as the upbeat but wavering Dolly.
The actor Stephen Rea does fine, grumbling work as Frank, Eileen's unhelpful husband who must step in and care for their many highly amused children. Will he have an epiphany about home and hearth? The movie leaves little doubt about the answer. Indeed, the menfolk left behind, and their needs and demands, would provide the women reason enough for a sojourn.
Dispensing wisdom throughout, Father Dermot (Mark O'Halloran) persuades Chrissie to join the pilgrimage. Later, he'll offer an impromptu homily on unmet expectations, one that is surprisingly apt for those hoping for a movie that transcends the pleasant. The filmmakers go for too-easy laughs; the movie doesn't seem to trust its audience to sit with the pain, much less to find the achy humor in it, as a more assured film might. The actors here are good, but they are not miracle workers.
The Miracle Club
Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and mildly salty language. Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes. In theaters.

LOS ANGELES — The Hollywood actors’ union approved a strike on Thursday for the first time in 43 years, bringing the $134 billion American movie and television business to a halt over anger about pay and fears of a tech-dominated future.
The leaders of SAG-AFTRA, the union representing 160,000 television and movie actors, announced the strike after negotiations with studios over a new contract collapsed, with streaming services and artificial intelligence at the center of the standoff.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lina Khan has said a fear of defeat should not deter the agency from suing big tech companies. But after Microsoft won a ruling this week, her critics say that strategy is flawed.
Lina Khan became chair of the Federal Trade Commission two years ago on a promise to bring bold action against the biggest tech companies.
For too long, Ms. Khan said at the time, the agency had been a weak cop and needed to challenge behemoths like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google in the courts to stem their growing power. Even if the F.T.C. lost the cases, she later added, they would be a partial victory because the agency would signal that antitrust laws needed to be updated for the modern internet era.
But on Tuesday, Ms. Khan suffered the biggest blow yet to her hallmark agenda. A federal judge rejected the F.T.C.'s attempt to stop Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard from closing, saying the agency failed to prove the deal would reduce competition and harm consumers. On Wednesday, the F.T.C. filed a notice that it would appeal the judge's decision.
That followed a loss in February, when a judge rejected an F.T.C. lawsuit seeking to block Meta from buying the virtual reality start-up Within.
The defeats raise questions about Ms. Khan's ability to carry out her ambitious goal of reversing decades of weak antitrust enforcement, as political pressure mounts and patience wanes for the 34-year-old academic, who has ruffled the feathers of corporate America. Ms. Khan's critics are more emboldened and are speaking out more loudly to poke holes in her take-it-to-the-courts strategy, saying the losses are not even partial wins -- they're just losses.
"I completely disagree with this approach," Anthony Sabino, a professor of business and law at St. John's University, said of Ms. Khan's methods. "She's trying to change a century's worth of antitrust law overnight, and that's not necessarily wise."
Adam Kovacevich, the chief executive of Chamber of Progress, a tech trade group, said the defeats made the F.T.C. appear less credible. "All these court losses are making their threats look more like a paper tiger," he said.
Others wondered if Ms. Khan was wasting the F.T.C.'s resources on can't-win cases. "They've crossed the line to being reckless with the cases they are bringing," said Ashley Baker, a director of public policy for Committee for Justice, a conservative think tank.
The tide of criticism puts Ms. Khan in the hot seat as she prepares further potential actions against the tech giants. The F.T.C. has filed antitrust suits against Meta and could bring a case against Amazon, which it has been investigating over claims of illegal monopolization.
Now Ms. Khan will first have to defend herself. On Thursday, she is expected to be grilled at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the F.T.C., with the Republican-led panel's website saying it wants to "examine mismanagement of the F.T.C. and its disregard for ethics and congressional oversight under Chair Lina Khan."
Ms. Khan declined to comment for this article, and Douglas Farrar, an F.T.C. spokesman, also declined to comment on how the court losses will affect her agenda. After the Microsoft-Activision ruling on Tuesday, Mr. Farrar said the agency was "disappointed in this outcome given the clear threat this merger poses to open competition in cloud gaming, subscription services and consoles."
Ms. Khan rose to fame while a Yale law student in 2017 when she argued in a paper for a law journal that Amazon was crushing competition and violating antitrust laws despite lowering prices for consumers. The paper helped kick off a debate about how to limit the tech giants and how to modernize antitrust practices.
After President Biden picked Ms. Khan to lead the F.T.C., she repeatedly argued that it needed to go to court -- win or lose -- to send the tech industry a strong signal that the agency was becoming a tougher sheriff. Even losses in court, she maintained, would gradually reform theories of antitrust.
Ms. Khan applied that thinking when the F.T.C. sued to stop Meta last year from buying a small virtual-reality company, Within. The case was a surprise because virtual reality is a nascent technology, making it hard to argue that the deal would reduce competition in a market that has not yet formed.
But Ms. Khan argued that regulators must stop violations of competition and consumer protections at the bleeding edge of technology, not just in areas where the companies had already become behemoths.
"What we can see is that inaction after inaction after inaction can have severe costs," she said in an interview with The New York Times and CNBC in January 2022. "And that's what we're really trying to reverse."
Early this year, a federal judge rejected the F.T.C.'s demand to block Meta's acquisition of Within. But the judge agreed with some of the F.T.C.'s arguments, including how the agency defined tech markets in the case.
The loss on Tuesday in the Microsoft-Activision case was more stinging, partly because the blockbuster merger has become a test of whether tech megadeals can go through despite rising regulatory scrutiny. Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said consumers benefited from Microsoft's expectation of a tough review, writing: "That scrutiny has paid off." But her ruling left little else that was redeeming for the F.T.C.
In the case, the agency argued that the deal should not close because it might harm competition. Microsoft might make some of Activision's games exclusive to its Xbox game consoles or degrade the experience of playing games like Activision's Call of Duty on competing consoles like Sony's PlayStation.
But Judge Corley wrote that the F.T.C. probably wouldn't win its challenge to the merger in the agency's internal court and said, essentially, that Microsoft was doing enough to prevent rivals from being hurt.
"The F.T.C. has not identified a single document which contradicts Microsoft's publicly stated commitment to make Call of Duty available on PlayStation," she wrote.
Eleanor Fox, a professor emeritus at New York University's law school, said it was too soon to have a verdict on Ms. Khan's strategy. Elsewhere in the world, especially in the European Union and in Britain, regulators have also pursued antitrust actions against large tech companies, she noted.
Ms. Khan, she said, "is only an outlier in the U.S., not globally."

Judge Nixes F.T.C. Delay Of Purchase By Microsoft: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Microsoft also said it was negotiating changes to the deal to satisfy objections made by a British regulator, which could allow it to complete its purchase of the video game giant as soon as this month.
A federal judge on Tuesday ruled against the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to delay Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, setting the stage for the tech giant and the video game publisher to merge as soon as this month.
In a 53-page decision, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said the F.T.C. had failed to show it was likely to prove the merger would result in a substantial reduction in competition that would harm consumers.
She denied the F.T.C.'s request for a preliminary injunction, which would have delayed the deal's closing until after the agency could fight it in an internal court.
The ruling is a significant blow to the F.T.C.'s efforts to police blockbuster tech mergers more aggressively. That strategy is spearheaded by the agency's chair, Lina Khan, who has argued that Big Tech's vast influence over commerce and communications has led to anticompetitive behavior. The F.T.C. has sued Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, but it walked away from one of its cases against Meta and has had little to show for its efforts so far.
Microsoft and Activision cheered the ruling. "We're grateful to the Court in San Francisco for this quick and thorough decision," Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, wrote on Twitter. Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision, said in a statement that the merger would "enable competition rather than allow entrenched market leaders to continue to dominate."
Douglas Farrar, a spokesman for the F.T.C., said in a statement that the agency was "disappointed in this outcome given the clear threat this merger poses to open competition in cloud gaming, subscription services and consoles." Mr. Farrar added that "in the coming days we'll be announcing our next step to continue our fight to preserve competition and protect consumers."
The ruling lifts the temporary ban on closing the deal just before midnight on Friday, unless the F.T.C. obtains an extension from an appeals court.
There were also indications on Tuesday that the tide may be shifting in favor of Microsoft in Britain, which presented the other major hurdle to the acquisition. Regulators there had blocked the deal, saying it would stifle competition in streaming games online. But on Tuesday, Microsoft said it was pausing its formal appeal of that ruling to negotiate a settlement.
The regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, said in a statement that it was open to a proposal that would address its concerns, giving Microsoft significant momentum to complete its acquisition as soon as next week.
From the start, the F.T.C. appeared to be fighting an uphill battle against Microsoft, which said early last year that it would buy Activision in an effort to reshape its video game business and bring marquee games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft to its Xbox platform.
Courts have been concerned that mergers involving direct competitors will harm competition, but Microsoft and Activision are generally not considered direct competitors.
The F.T.C. sued Microsoft in its administrative court last year, but that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal from closing. In June, the F.T.C. asked Judge Corley to take that step, saying it feared Microsoft was on the verge of completing the transaction despite the government's concerns.
Over five days of testimony last month, the F.T.C. called high-profile witnesses like Mr. Kotick and Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, as it made the case that the merger would be bad for gamers and for competition.
The F.T.C. argued that Microsoft had significant incentives to make Activision's Call of Duty -- a franchise with more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue -- exclusive to the Xbox, withholding it from Sony's PlayStation or degrading PlayStation versions of the game.
But Microsoft said it had signed deals with companies like Nintendo to offer Call of Duty on other platforms, and had offered Sony a deal as well. Microsoft argued that it would have no incentive to risk angering gamers by reneging on its commitments to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation, and that it would lose out on a significant amount of revenue by cutting off PlayStation players.
Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
At times, Judge Corley seemed skeptical of the F.T.C.'s case. During closing arguments, she pressed the agency repeatedly to back up its claim that if Call of Duty was withheld from PlayStation, enough players would abandon PlayStation for Xbox to make the move worthwhile for Microsoft.
"The F.T.C. has not shown it is likely to succeed on its assertion the combined firm will probably pull Call of Duty from Sony PlayStation, or that its ownership of Activision content will substantially lessen competition in the video game library subscription and cloud gaming markets," Judge Corley wrote in her decision.
"To the contrary," she added later, "the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content."
She wrote that despite "extensive discovery," including close to one million documents and 30 depositions, the F.T.C. "has not identified a single document which contradicts Microsoft's publicly stated commitment to make Call of Duty available on PlayStation (and Nintendo Switch)."
Her denial of a preliminary injunction means Microsoft could complete its merger with Activision as soon as this month in the United States. The companies set a July 18 deadline for the deal, with Microsoft required to pay Activision a $ 3 billion breakup fee if the deal does not go through by then. The companies could agree to delay that date, or they could merge while their appeal in Britain is pending.
It was the F.T.C.'s latest loss in a case involving one of the tech giants. While legal challenges under Ms. Khan caused companies like Lockheed Martin and the chip maker Nvidia to drop proposed acquisitions early in her tenure, the agency was unsuccessful this year in challenging Meta's purchase of a virtual reality start-up.
Ms. Khan has said she won't be deterred by courtroom losses. The chair and her allies believe that regulators were too risk-averse for years, leading to runaway corporate consolidation. They have said the F.T.C. and other government agencies must be willing to pursue novel cases even if they are not guaranteed wins.
In her ruling, Judge Corley argued that consumers benefited from Microsoft's expectation of a tough review, making agreements in writing and under oath to share Activision games with different consoles and streaming services. "That scrutiny has paid off," she wrote.

A Family Curse Unfolds With Peekaboo Shocks: [Review]

Full text: Patrick Wilson makes his directorial debut with this fifth installment of the horror franchise haunted by a red-faced demon.
"Insidious," whose fifth installment opened Friday, is a second-tier horror franchise -- it's not even the best James Wan franchise starring Patrick Wilson, which would be "The Conjuring" -- with a few elite jump scares, including one of the best in the genre. In the original in 2010, Lorraine Lambert (Barbara Hershey) is telling her son, Josh (Wilson), about a horrible dream when a red-faced demon suddenly appears behind his head. It's a magnificent shock because of the askew blocking, the patient misdirection of the editing and Hershey's committed performance.
In "Insidious: The Red Door," a grim, workmanlike effort that collapses into woo-woo nonsense, Wilson makes his directorial debut, and demonstrates he grasps the importance of that jump scare, which is sketched in charcoal on paper next to his name in the opening credits. But that reference is also a reminder of what's missing.
The movie begins nine years after the second "Insidious" at the funeral of Lorraine, and its first scare, a nicely oblique if relatively simple one, once again takes place above her son's head. Josh's memory has been scrubbed in the previous film but nags at him, and Wilson doesn't move the camera from his own face inside a car as he goes through an array of emotions while texting his son Dalton (Ty Simpkins). This prickly relationship is at the center of the movie, as dad drives his son to college. They share the family curse, a habit of being visited by evil figures from another realm called the Further (think the Upside Down from "Stranger Things").
As has become cliché, trauma takes center stage, with characters mouthing lines like, "We need to remember even the things that hurt" -- which is at least better than pretentious small talk like "Death floods the mind with memory."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The leaden screenplay would be easier to overlook if there were more spooky sequences. Wilson stages one nicely claustrophobic scene inside an M.R.I. machine, but his peekaboo shocks can be a little telegraphed. And while his placid, android handsomeness can hint at the uncanny, making him a magnetic horror actor, there are fewer standout performances than in previous installments of the series, which has been notable for turns by Rose Byrne and Lin Shaye (both of whom show up again, too briefly). "The Red Door" loses energy when it focuses on Simpkins's Dalton, a blandly brooding artist type who cries while painting, and the grim doings in the Further, whose aesthetic evokes a homemade haunted house in the family garage.
"Insidious" is essentially a ghost story, so ending it presents a typical challenge. Unlike with vampires and serial killers, it's not clear how the apparition threatens to end the chase. The abrupt resolution of this chapter is a letdown, but not as much of one as the return of the red-faced demon, who pops up, unobscured, center frame. The result is not a jump scare so much as a bunny hop.
Insidious: The Red Door
Rated PG-13 for explicit violins and implicit violence. Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes. In theaters.

A Cry for Help Finds a Beat and Becomes a Global Hit: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Nomcebo Zikode, the South African singer of the pandemic hit "Jerusalema" that inspired a global dance challenge, wrote the chorus while battling her own depression.
It starts with a clap, and then the feet tap along to the beat: four times on each side, followed by a quick jump. As the melody rises, dancers dip low and twirl.
It's a dance easy enough for anyone to learn, and people all around the world have done so, with everyone from an urban dance crew in Angola to Franciscan nuns in Europe showing off their moves on social media.
The "Jerusalema" dance, named for the South African hit song that inspired it, provided a moment of global joy during the lockdowns of the pandemic, a welcome distraction from the isolation and collective grief.
But it was the chorus, a lamentation over a heavy bass beat, that was balm to millions. Sung in a low alto in isiZulu, one of the official languages of South Africa, audiences didn't need to understand the song to be moved by it.
The singer Nomcebo Nkwanyana, who goes by Nomcebo Zikode professionally, drew on her own intense pain when she wrote it.
"Jerusalem is my home," she sang. "Guard me. Walk with me. Do not leave me here."
After more than decade as an overlooked backing vocalist, and with her faith in music faltering, Ms. Zikode, 37, was in a dark place in 2019 when she wrote those words.
Her manager, who is also her husband, insisted she write the lyrics to help her crowd out the voices in her head that were telling her to give up on music, and herself.
"As if there's a voice that says you must kill yourself," she said, describing her depression at the time. "I remember talking to myself saying, 'no, I can't kill myself. I've got my kids to raise. I can't, I can't do that."'
She didn't listen to the recording of the song until a day after it was made. As the bass began to reverberate through her car, everything went dark, she said, and she almost lost control of the vehicle. She pulled over, tears streaming down her face.
"Even if you don't believe it, this is my story," she said. "I heard the voice saying to me, 'Nomcebo, this is going to be a big song all over the world."'
And that prognostication soon proved true.
In February 2020, a group of dancers in Angola uploaded a video showing off their choreography to the song, and challenging others to outdo them. As lockdowns were enforced just weeks later, the song was shared around the world.
The global success of "Jerusalema" has taken Ms. Zikode on tour to Europe, the Caribbean and the United States. It also led to her being featured on the song "Bayethe," which would win the Grammy award for Best Global Music Performance earlier this year.
But while "Jerusalema" has brought her global renown, she has had to fight to earn any financial reward from it and to be recognized as part of its creative force.
She sued her record label, and a settlement in December called for her to receive a percentage of the song's royalties and to be allowed to audit the books of the label, Open Mic Productions, that owns the song.
At least as important, the agreement also states that Ms. Zikode must be cited as the song's "primary artist" alongside Kgaogelo Moagi, more commonly known as Master KG, the producer behind the instrumental track on "Jerusalema."
But even this victory in South Africa's male-dominated music industry comes with significant caveats: For one, Master KG is receiving a higher percentage of royalties. And Ms. Zikode said she has yet to see payment. "I'm still waiting for my money," she said.
Open Mic did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but in a statement put out after her Grammy win, the label said: "She is a very talented artist and we welcome this agreement as a progressive resolution."
Struggles with money are nothing new to her.
The youngest of four children born in a polygamous marriage, Ms. Zikode's father died when she was young and her mother, the third wife, was left destitute. Desperate, her mother let a church outside Hammarsdale, a small town in South Africa's eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, take her daughter in for four years.
There, she slept on bunk beds among rows of other children. She sewed her own clothes and helped to clean the dormitories. The church choir was a solace, but she sorely missed home until she was able to return in the 10th grade.
Her mother sold maize or bartered what vegetables she could grow for secondhand clothes. The neighbors who would ask the young Ms. Zikode to sing for them would feed her and take her in for a few nights as her mother struggled.
When she was old enough, Ms. Zikode learned to braid other people's hair to earn some money, but remembers self-consciously pressing her elbows to her side, for fear that her customers would smell that she could not afford deodorant.
But what she really wanted was to sing, and she got her break at an open-call audition. She spent years singing backup for gospel stars, sharing crowded apartments with other backing vocalists. When gigs dried up, she took computer classes as a career backup plan.
Ms Zikode's first major South African hit came in 2017 when she sang vocals on the song "Emazulwini" for a well-known house music producer and D.J., Frederick Ganyani Tshabalala. But what had seemed like a long-awaited break turned into a letdown when DJ Ganyani, as he is known, did all he could, she said, to prevent her from performing the song live on her own.
"They try by all means to suppress the singers," Ms. Zikode said of the D.J.s and producers who hold most of the power in South Africa's music industry.
DJ Ganyani did not respond to requests for comment.
Hoping a record label would better protect her rights, Ms. Zikode signed with Open Mic, but once the deal was inked, the label went quiet, she said, and she was left hustling to record her debut album.
Feeling abandoned by the record company, her husband and manager, Selwyn Fraser, sent messages to other artists, masquerading as his wife on Instagram and Twitter, trying to get bigger names to work with her.
This outreach campaign connected Ms. Zikode with Master KG and resulted in "Jerusalema."
It's not only the song that has made her a household name in South Africa, but also her very public fight for her royalties and recognition, in the courts and on social media, said Kgopolo Mphela, a South African entertainment commentator.
"She's coming across as the hero, or the underdog, taking on Goliath," Mr. Mphela said.
For all her struggles with reaping the monetary benefits of "Jerusalema," Ms. Zikode's musical career has made her financially comfortable and she now has a music publishing deal with a division of Sony Music.
Her 17-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son want for nothing, she said. She and her husband renovated their home, adding an in-house studio.
Ms. Zikode can also bask in the accolades that have come with her Grammy win for "Bayethe."
On a chilly April night in Johannesburg, in the Grammy's afterglow, Ms. Zikode stepped out of a borrowed Bentley at an event to celebrate South Africans who have achieved international success.
As she walked the red carpet, determined to own the moment, she granted every interview request, whether from the national broadcaster or a TikTok influencer. Later that night, she accepted two checks, one for herself and one for a charity she founded that helps impoverished young women.
When she took the stage to perform the song that made her famous, she hiked up her gown to dance the "Jerusalema."

Full text: When Patrick Wilson was first approached about reprising the role of Josh Lambert -- the patriarch of a family terrorized by ghouls in James Wan's haunted-house chiller, "Insidious" (2010) -- he was unenthusiastic.
"Another sequel? I thought, 'Oh boy, what new ground is there to even cover?' I'm good. I've got my other horror franchise," Wilson said.
The "other" franchise refers to "The Conjuring," also conceived by Wan, which began as a 2013 paranormal horror tale that led to a separate universe of sequels and prequels in which Wilson plays one half of a team of married demonologists. Between "The Conjuring" and the first two "Insidious" movies, Wilson has established himself as a bona fide scream king. Still, he's a classically trained actor who has starred in big-budget superhero movies ("Watchmen," "Aquaman"), indie dramas ("Little Children") and musical theater productions ("Oklahoma!"). The prospect of a new "Insidious" didn't seem all that exciting.
Then, Wilson was asked if he'd consider directing it, too. That got his attention.
"I'd been trying to direct a movie since 2015," Wilson told me over coffee at a West Village bistro. "TV didn't appeal to me. And I'm not the kind of guy who wants to make a tiny indie that nobody sees just to prove that I can do it. I want my movie to play well in theaters, so to have this half-a-billion-dollar franchise supported by a studio come my way -- that's rare for a first-time director."
"Insidious: The Red Door," the fifth movie to fly under the "Insidious" banner, wisely skips over the lackluster third and fourth installments and returns to the events of "Insidious: Chapter 2" (2013). After nearly ax-murdering his entire family, Jack Torrance-style, Josh retakes control of his body from a psycho-biddy demon, and -- with the help of a mind-scrubbing hypnotist -- completely represses all memory of his possession. The Lamberts are free and the credits roll.
"No offense, but that's not how you deal with a problem," Wilson chuckled.
"The Red Door" confronts the trauma of that earlier film from the perspective of a father-son relationship. Ten years later, Josh has separated from his wife, Renai (Rose Byrne), and is the quintessential absent dad, haunted by a past he can't articulate. In "Insidious," it's revealed that the couple's eldest child, Dalton (Ty Simpkins), has inherited his father's ability to astral project, which renders him vulnerable to the ghosts hanging out in a netherworld called the Further. Dalton, too, had his memory erased. Now, the prickly teenager rejects his father, though he's stuck with him on the drive to his first year of art school.
I asked Wilson if his sons -- one is heading to college soon -- send him curt one-word texts. "Nah, we have a great relationship," said Wilson, who since 2005 has been married to the actress Dagmara Dominczyk (Karolina in "Succession").
Wilson accepted the offer to direct "The Red Door" under the condition that it would "make sense with my life." In practical terms, this meant shooting near his home in Montclair, N.J. ("It was almost like a regular job, coming back to the family after work," he said.) But he was also keen for his debut to reflect him as a person.
Before shooting the Roland Emmerich disaster flick "Moonfall" (2022) and the forthcoming "Aquaman" sequel, Wilson sat down with the screenwriter Scott Teems ("Halloween Kills") and, essentially, bared his soul. Teems took these raw materials and shaped them into a story about inherited trauma and artistic vulnerability -- with jump scares and creepy-crawlies, of course.
The film marks a return to form for the "Insidious" franchise, recapturing the original's pretentiousless thrills and fun-house charms, approaching the Lamberts' grim history with the silliness and sincerity of throwback horror from the '80s or '90s.
"The best kind of horror movie makes you feel unsafe," Michael Koresky, the co-founder of the Museum of Moving Image's house publication, Reverse Shot, wrote in an email. Koresky is a fan of the "Insidious" movies, explaining that watching the original was like "a breath of fresh air amid the fetid field of reactionary early-21st-century horror, which had become reliant on gruesome torture. Every time a face appeared after a shock cut, I remember feeling played like a piano -- thrillingly so."
Wilson wasn't an especially big fan of the genre when he first signed on to "Insidious." He considers himself a generalist. "I grew up with Indiana Jones and 'Star Wars,"' said Wilson, who just turned 50, adding that his taste in film was shaped by outings to the multiplexes around Tampa Bay, Fla., where he was raised with his two older brothers.
"I was into horror movies that transcended genre -- 'Salem's Lot,' 'Jaws."' His eyes widened: "'Poltergeist.' I remember when I was a kid, our house was robbed. Absolutely no connection to the 'Poltergeist,' but the way my brain processed that event, the terror I felt when we got home and realized our house had been invaded, my memory embedded the two things together."
For "The Red Door," Wilson knew he wanted Dalton to be an artist, invoking the horror archetype of the gloomy kid drawing morbid images in crayon -- only Dalton, at 18, has decided to make a career out of it. "Going to any kind of arts school is spiritually taxing," Wilson said, recalling his years in Carnegie Mellon University's acting conservatory. Under the tutelage of a demanding professor (Hiam Abbass from "Succession"), Dalton is encouraged to dig into his inner life to fuel his work, which teases the Further's fiends out of hiding.
Wilson routinely travels to Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh to lead acting workshops. "I've always been comfortable with instructing others," he said, explaining that he may not be a "film school guy" but he does know a thing or two about how the camera creates images.
"I'm always conscious of my relationship to the camera when I act -- what is the lens size? How is it moving? I made my actors watch themselves because what you feel and what the audience sees can be different things."
Josh, terrified that he's perpetuating the mistakes of his own father, tries desperately to find the cause for his instability. In one eerie sequence, he gets an M.R.I. When he's in the machine, the lights cut off, and the camera approximates the patient's woozy point of view -- total vulnerability, meaning something's just around the corner.
Set primarily on a college campus, the film also pokes fun at the fragility of men who try incredibly hard to seem, well, masculine -- like the toxic fraternity brothers floating in Dalton's orbit. Wilson's own statuesque appearance -- I told him I still think of him as the "prom king," the name given to him by the lusty neighborhood mothers in "Little Children" -- might seem to group him with this lot. With "The Red Door," Wilson made a point to engage with the cultural conversation about masculinity. Being a father to two sons means he's constantly thinking about what it means to promote a healthy identity for young men.
"Men have a hard time sharing how they feel, me included," Ty Simpkins wrote in an email. He and Wilson have something of a longstanding father-son bond: Simpkins's first role was as the prom king's jester-hat-wearing toddler in "Little Children," and Wilson "even shared a beer with me on my 21st birthday," Simpkins added.
Wilson perked up when I asked him about his love of rock music, another personal touch he weaves into his directing debut. Listen closely and you'll hear him singing over the end credits to the heavy-metal stylings of the Swedish band Ghost. Wilson seemed giddy to join the small ranks of directors who sing songs in their own movies. He cited John Carpenter and "Big Trouble in Little China" as an inspiration.
When Mike Nichols cast him in "Angels in America," Wilson said the director talked to him about Paul Newman's career. "Being a movie star is hard, he told me. You go where it takes you. To enjoy doing one of the opportunities given to you -- that's a privilege."

JOHANNESBURG — It starts with a clap, and then the feet tap along to the beat: four times on each side, followed by a quick jump. As the melody rises, dancers dip low and twirl.
It’s a dance easy enough for anyone to learn, and people all around the world have done so, with everyone from an urban dance crew in Angola to Franciscan nuns in Europe showing off their moves on social media.
The “Jerusalema” dance, named for the South African hit song that inspired it, provided a moment of global joy during the lockdowns of the pandemic, a welcome distraction from the isolation and collective grief.
But it was the chorus, a lamentation over a heavy bass beat, that was balm to millions. Sung in a low alto in isiZulu, one of the official languages of South Africa, audiences didn’t need to understand the song to be moved by it.
Singer Nomcebo Nkwanyana, who goes by Nomcebo Zikode professionally, drew on her own intense pain when she wrote it.
“Jerusalem is my home,” she sang. “Guard me. Walk with me. Do not leave me here.”
After more than decade as an overlooked backing vocalist, and with her faith in music faltering, Zikode, 37, was in a dark place in 2019 when she wrote those words.
Her manager, who is also her husband, insisted she write the lyrics to help her crowd out the voices in her head that were telling her to give up on music, and herself.
“As if there’s a voice that says you must kill yourself,” she said, describing her depression at the time. “I remember talking to myself saying, ‘no, I can’t kill myself. I’ve got my kids to raise. I can’t, I can’t do that.’”
She didn’t listen to the recording of the song until a day after it was made. As the bass began to reverberate through her car, everything went dark, she said, and she almost lost control of the vehicle. She pulled over, tears streaming down her face.
“Even if you don’t believe it, this is my story,” she said. “I heard the voice saying to me, ‘Nomcebo, this is going to be a big song all over the world.’”
And that prognostication soon proved true.
In February 2020, a group of dancers in Angola uploaded a video showing off their choreography to the song, and challenging others to outdo them. As lockdowns were enforced just weeks later, the song was shared around the world.
The global success of “Jerusalema” has taken Zikode on tour to Europe, the Caribbean and the United States. It also led to her being featured on the song “Bayethe,” which would win the Grammy Award for Best Global Music Performance earlier this year.
But while “Jerusalema” has brought her global renown, she has had to fight to earn any financial reward from it and to be recognized as part of its creative force.
She sued her record label, and a settlement in December called for her to receive a percentage of the song’s royalties and to be allowed to audit the books of the label, Open Mic Productions, that owns the song.
At least as important, the agreement also states that Zikode must be cited as the song’s “primary artist” alongside Kgaogelo Moagi, more commonly known as Master KG, the producer behind the instrumental track on “Jerusalema.”
But even this victory in South Africa’s male-dominated music industry comes with significant caveats: For one, Master KG is receiving a higher percentage of royalties. And Zikode said she has yet to see payment. “I’m still waiting for my money,” she said.
Open Mic did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but in a statement put out after her Grammy win, the label said: “She is a very talented artist and we welcome this agreement as a progressive resolution.”
Struggles with money are nothing new to her.
The youngest of four children born in a polygamous marriage, Zikode’s father died when she was young and her mother, the third wife, was left destitute. Desperate, her mother let a church outside Hammarsdale, a small town in South Africa’s eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, take her daughter in for four years.
There, she slept on bunk beds among rows of other children. She sewed her own clothes and helped to clean the dormitories. The church choir was a solace, but she sorely missed home until she was able to return in the 10th grade.
Her mother sold maize or bartered what vegetables she could grow for secondhand clothes. The neighbors who would ask the young Zikode to sing for them would feed her and take her in for a few nights as her mother struggled.
When she was old enough, Zikode learned to braid other people’s hair to earn some money, but remembers self-consciously pressing her elbows to her side, for fear that her customers would smell that she could not afford deodorant.
But what she really wanted was to sing, and she got her break at an open-call audition. She spent years singing backup for gospel stars, sharing crowded apartments with other backing vocalists. When gigs dried up, she took computer classes as a backup plan.
Zikode’s first major South African hit came in 2017 when she sang vocals on the song “Emazulwini” for a well-known house music producer and DJ, Frederick Ganyani Tshabalala. But what had seemed like a long-awaited break turned into a letdown when DJ Ganyani, as he is known, did all he could, she said, to prevent her from performing the song live on her own.
“They try by all means to suppress the singers,” Zikode said of the DJs and producers who hold most of the power in South Africa’s music industry.
DJ Ganyani did not respond to requests for comment.
Hoping a record label would better protect her rights, Zikode signed with Open Mic, but once the deal was inked, the label went quiet, she said, and she was left hustling to record her debut album.
Feeling abandoned by the record company, her husband and manager, Selwyn Fraser, sent messages to other artists, masquerading as his wife on Instagram and Twitter, trying to get bigger names to work with her.
This outreach campaign connected Zikode with Master KG and resulted in “Jerusalema.”
It’s not only the song that has made her a household name in South Africa, but also her very public fight for her royalties and recognition, in the courts and on social media, said Kgopolo Mphela, a South African entertainment commentator.
“She’s coming across as the hero, or the underdog, taking on Goliath,” Mphela said.
For all her struggles with reaping the monetary benefits of “Jerusalema,” Zikode’s musical career has made her financially comfortable and she now has a music publishing deal with a division of Sony Music.
Her 17-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son want for nothing, she said. She and her husband renovated their home, adding an in-house studio.
Zikode can also bask in the accolades that have come with her Grammy win for “Bayethe.”
On a chilly April night in Johannesburg, in the Grammy’s afterglow, Zikode stepped out of a borrowed Bentley at an event to celebrate South Africans who have achieved international success.
As she walked the red carpet, determined to own the moment, she granted every interview request, whether from the national broadcaster or a TikTok influencer. Later that night, she accepted two checks, one for herself and one for a charity she founded that helps impoverished young women.
When she took the stage to perform the song that made her famous, she hiked up her gown to dance the “Jerusalema.”

In Screens We Trust (And Distrust): [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Full of experiments with new media, the museum's giant exhibition displays the powers and the pitfalls of seeing the world through a screen.
Beauty is nice, elegance has its place, but sometimes I go to museums to be perplexed: to agree and disagree, to argue and reassess, to leave even less certain than I was before. I sure got my wish with "Signals: How Video Transformed the World," which closes this weekend at the Museum of Modern Art -- and which, screen for screen, hour for hour, stands proud as the most perplexing exhibition of the year.
Maybe a dozen times since its opening in March I have ascended to MoMA's top floor for this ambitious, irregular exhibition of video art, the largest this museum has ever put on. I've swum through its panoply of screens and projections, broadcasting more footage than any one visitor could ever take in. Did I like it? I still have no idea after four months, though my feelings about "Signals" have settled into some unholy mix of admiration, bafflement, intellectual provocation, political fatalism and (in the case of one work) absolute fury. Given the recent subtropical weather here in New York, this final weekend might be ideal for wrestling with "Signals" in MoMA's climate-controlled galleries. Go with a friend, and then fight about it.
"Signals," drawn from the museum's collection by the curators Stuart Comer and Michelle Kuo, is decidedly not a history of video art. It aims instead to present video as a communication medium -- transmitted by artist-citizens, through closed circuits or TV satellites or mobile phone apps, to document an incident or to rally a public. The focus on communication means it leaves out many of the medium's pioneers, from Bruce Nauman to Joan Jonas. (Fair enough: Nauman had a major retrospective in these same galleries in 2018, and Jonas has one coming up next year.) Nam June Paik still reigns as the father of video art, yet his most prominent work here is a later one: "Good Morning, Mr. Orwell," a live satellite broadcast of music and dance performances, whose soft-edged images beamed simultaneously from New York and Paris on New Year's Day 1984.
Rather than recording and playback, this show puts a premium on how video imagery circulates: through a network, through a society. It is thus almost cavalierly relaxed about video's technical properties, and drifts without distinction from the Sony PortaPak to the Samsung Galaxy. Confusingly, one of the show's largest objects, Stan VanDerBeek's "Movie-Drome" of 1964-65, is not video art at all -- but rather a work of expanded cinema, for which the American techno-optimist projected 16-millimeter films and 35- and 70-millimeter slides on the roof of a prefab aluminum igloo. (MoMA's media conservators have used some video projectors for their impressive reconstruction of the "Movie-Drome," but those are contemporary digital stand-ins for VanDerBeek's original film reels and slide shows.) VanDerBeek had imagined a whole world of Movie-Dromes, linked up into an "artist interchange."
The show is relaxed, too, about display conditions. Very few videos are screened in black boxes, and sound bleeds from one installation to the other, though the museum does make admirable allowances for visitors with hearing impairments: written descriptions of the audio tracks, headphones to borrow. I appreciated Comer and Kuo's relaxed approach to display, and especially their decision to stream more than 70 of the show's single-channel videos for free at moma.org. Knowing you can watch later at home frees you from having to imbibe every video in one go, though online playback introduces a new idiosyncrasy: the high-speed scrubber bar, whose preview thumbnails and instant fast-forwarding kill once and for all the pretense of video art as an absorptive medium.
So this is not so much an exhibition of video art as an exhibition of video against: video against broadcast television, video against government censorship, video against corporate interests. This antagonistic pose has become a little reflexive at MoMA lately, and not always convincing. More than a few videos and installations here, such as an archive of queer interviews from Carlos Motta and an animation about colonial monuments from the collective New Red Order, come across as showcases of visibility that an elite institution can easily metabolize.
Whereas the best of the younger artists in "Signals" have real skepticism about the value of visibility and documentation. Tiffany Sia's "Never Rest/Unrest" (2020) shows the flip side of viral protest videos -- presenting mundane imagery from Hong Kong's stifled pro-democracy demonstrations, which she shot in the same 16:9 vertical aspect ratio as every other protester's iPhone. For Sondra Perry's two-screen projection "Double Quadruple Etcetera Etcetera I & II" (2013), the artist filmed two Black dancers, wearing white clothing, performing against white walls; she then used "context-aware" editing software (a dubious name) to dissolve the dancers' bodies into their environments. The digital effacement stutters, though. It glitches. The ghost haunts the machine; the Black figure defies elite capture in ways straight-on representation cannot.
For a naïve trust in the screen can lead to myopia and even moral catastrophe, as it did here in six videos by Frances Stark. Her "U.S. Greatest Hits Mix Tape Volume I" consists of six iPads that each screen two other videos, playing on computers on the artist's desk in Los Angeles. One of the screens-in-the-screen plays an old pop song; the other plays YouTube clips of contemporaneous wars or disputes that, so we are told, the United States orchestrated. One of these videos implies that the U.S., rather than the Soviet Union, bears principal blame for the war in Afghanistan that began in 1979 (while playing Barbra Streisand and Donna Summer). Another simply transmits a speech by the Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro, blaming "the empire in the United States" for the 2019 uprising against his rule (featuring Ariana Grande). The most appalling ascribes the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine to American interference -- a fiction often espoused in the Russian media to justify President Vladimir V. Putin's initial invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea.
When I say MoMA spent four months relaying Putinist propaganda, I am not being excessive. The Afghanistan video incorporates footage from Russia Today, the Kremlin-backed cable network. The Ukraine conspiracy theory comes from a small-time YouTube channel that promotes Russian war messaging, which the "Western mainstream media is unwilling to say." And if you thought Stark was making some distanced commentary on digital gullibility, MoMA thought otherwise. When I first saw the show in March, the wall texts stated outright that Stark's work "examines the history of U.S. military intervention in six countries," and outrageously listed Ukraine's democratic revolution as one of these American military plots. The text was later changed in response to public complaints; it now accuses the U.S. of "alleged or covert involvement." That introduces about as much subtlety as the Katy Perry song that plays in the background.
MoMA should never have acquired this bankrupt "Mix Tape." But within the din of "Signals," Stark's useful idiocy (to use the old Cold War term for Western dupes apologizing for foreign tyranny) may have an accidental value -- as an admonition against the poor habits of streaming, linking, sharing and commenting, in which the last democratic potential of video seems to have drowned. In this show's catalog, the art historian David Joselit observes how video in the 2010s became less about archiving events and more about perpetual renewal and erasure, and how our endless recording has ironically left us with "an eradication of history." The best videos in "Signals" stand against that eradication, especially two you can watch in person or online this last weekend.
One is a classic: "Videograms of a Revolution," from 1992, by the German filmmaker Harun Farocki and his Romanian collaborator Andrei Ujica. In the last days before the 1989 overthrow and execution of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, pro-democracy demonstrators took over the headquarters of a Bucharest television station, kicked out the propagandists, and started broadcasting for themselves: news from the front, reporting about the revolution, but also personal testimonies and even folk songs. Farocki and Ujica compiled hundreds of hours from Romanian free television, and produced an invaluable archive of video's democratic potential in times of extreme upheaval.
One is newer: "Letter to a Turtledove," a beautifully jagged video poem from 2020, by the young Ukrainian artist Dana Kavelina. Mixing stop-motion animation, camera-phone videos from Ukrainian soldiers, and backward-projected 1930s Stalinist footage, this wrenching recent work pictures the Donbas (the industrial, predominantly Russian-speaking region of eastern Ukraine) as a territory of both historical and contemporary amnesia, erased here by propaganda, there by indifference. Like so many artists after the 2014 Maidan Revolution -- which was not an American plot, as this show initially suggested -- she found beneath the polluted Donbas soil the aquifers of a new Ukrainian art, grown only more urgent since the full-scale invasion. When Kavelina's titular turtledove turns into a flaming fighter jet, when her whispered poetry gives way to air raid sirens, you remember whose signals need to get through, and whose should be jammed.

Full text: You could see the head tilts and darting glances when people peered around Pebble Beach's Gallery Cafe, or as visitors sat on the patio that looks toward the cypress-guarded 18th green by Stillwater Cove. They surfaced at a luncheon with Brandi Chastain and Kristi Yamaguchi, and during a climb up a flight of stairs, and a stroll through a lobby.
That's Michelle Wie West, that 6-foot fixture of collective memory and modern golf history.
She did not win as much as she wanted to, and certainly not as much as many people thought she would or should have. But after close to a quarter of a century in the spotlight, she is still one of the savviest stars women's golf has ever had, a player plenty of people outside of golf know as a star even if they do not know golf.
The competitive golf part of Wie's life will most likely be done by dusk on Sunday, when the U.S. Women's Open is scheduled to finish at Pebble Beach. If things don't go well, and they might not since Wie West's husband will be her caddie for the first time and she has barely played lately, it could be over by dusk on Friday. After the Open, she has no plans to return to elite competition, though she dodges the word "retirement" in public (and confesses to sometimes using it in private).
She is 33.
That went fast, didn't it?
In 2000, when she was 10 and Bill Clinton was president, she played the U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links Championship. She won the event when she was 13, the same age she made an L.P.G.A. tournament cut and had a turn in third place on a major tournament's weekend leaderboard. She played a PGA Tour event at 14, turned professional at 15, rattled off three top-five finishes in her first three majors as a pro, battled wrist trouble, won the Open at 24 and then spent years with more injuries, cuts and withdrawals than strong showings.
So it was not that fast, after all. Soon, though, it will apparently be finished. Barring a victory this weekend or a surprise in the years ahead, Wie West will finish with five L.P.G.A. Tour wins, including the 2014 Open at Pinehurst, tied for 69th on the career victory list. It adds up to a far better career than most players, though short of the mighty expectations that followed Wie West from the start and flowed from a blend of internet-age youth, talent, celebrity and marketability. (By way of comparison, Inbee Park, a 34-year-old player from South Korea, has won seven majors but has long drawn a fraction of the public attention that Wie West commanded.)
"What's the right word for this?" Wie West said in an interview in a sun-splashed lounge, well out of earshot of any aides.
"I feel very -- confident that I had the career that I wanted to," she continued eventually. "Obviously, I wish I could have done more as well. I think anyone and everyone thinks that."
But, she said, "the what-ifs and the regrets and the 'I wish I could have done this better' can drive you truly insane."
Even last year's announcement of a transition, to use her publicly preferred term, got derailed when her husband came down with Covid-19 and Wie West's parents stayed back to help with child care. Ready to detail the wind-down she had rolled out on Instagram the previous week, Wie West wound up nearly alone at the 2022 Open in North Carolina.
She had been mulling for years whether it was time to stop playing, frustrated by injuries and, more recently, torn by the notion of her family of three having only so much time together. In 2021, vulgar comments about Wie West by Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, jolted her into a fresh sense of purpose.
But there eventually came a point, she said, when she realized the game's toll was ultimately too high, when she feared her body would be so broken down she would not even be able to play a round for pleasure with her daughter. Her clubs have been in her bag almost exclusively ever since.
"It's hard," she said, "it's hard to know when the right time is to walk away."
That is assuredly in part because, for an athlete in any sport, stepping back from competition means the statistics are done and that the résumé is, with few exceptions, frozen. For Wie West, retiring or transitioning or whatever you want to call it meant firing up the inevitable debate about whether she had been a squandered or overhyped talent.
She hears it, of course. She also gets it.
"People love to chirp and have their own feeling and whatnot, and they totally have the right to it: They have been invested in my career," she said. "I know I haven't won as many as I, quote-unquote, should have."
At the same time, she seems to wonder how fair it is. She earned a degree from Stanford and won a U.S. Open, and those two feats, she figures, are what she wanted to do anyway.
And yet she can still run through all of the ways her career could have been different: if she had held onto a share of the lead at the 2005 Open at Cherry Hills, if her quest that year to earn a spot in the Masters had worked out, if she had made the cut at her first PGA Tour event instead of missing it by a stroke.
She is entering this week's 156-woman Open with measured expectations against a deep field.
The reigning champion, Minjee Lee, has won two majors since 2021 and is not ranked in the top-five in the world. And there is Rose Zhang, the 20-year-old Stanford student who last month won her debut tournament as a professional. Wie West's group, which will tee off at 8:28 a.m. Pacific time on Thursday, includes the three-time major winner In Gee Chun and Annika Sorenstam, who logged 10 major victories in her career and received a special exemption into this week's field.
This spring, Wie West was musing about how she needed to get her stamina up for the rigors of a major, how she needed to hone her iron and wedge play before returning to one of golf's biggest stages, especially since it will be played this year on one of the sport's most beloved courses.
"Just have to believe in myself, just get to a point where I feel confident that I can execute the shots and make the putts," she said. "And I'm hoping that it all comes very quickly."
She plans to remain closely connected to the sport -- she recently hosted the L.P.G.A. tournament that Zhang won -- but insisted that she does not think much about how she transformed perceptions of the game that she said still enchants her.
Even now, she said, she will play with her husband and become persuaded that, like every other golfer who has won, lost or never actually contested a major, she has unlocked the sport's mysteries.
"You get that one feeling and it feels really good, and you're like, 'I think I've figured out the game. I've figured it out!"' she said. "I still catch myself saying that almost every time I play, so I know there's an itch to want to get better."
Soon enough, after all of this time, it will be happening away from the spotlight.

Time Is Running Out for These Titles on Netflix: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The best James Bond movie of recent years is among a handful of great titles leaving soon for U.S. subscribers.
This July, several Oscar-nominated performances will depart from Netflix in the United States, along with two top-notch genre films and one of the most successful entries in the James Bond franchise -- and that's saying something. Here are a few of the highlights. (Dates indicate the final day a title is available.)
'Ip Man' (July 21)
If you were taken by Donnie Yen's electrifying supporting turn in "John Wick: Chapter 4," well, add this one to your queue posthaste. Yen stars as Grandmaster Ip Man, the legendary martial artist and Wing Chun instructor. But this is no staid biopic. It's an action epic -- packed with lightning-paced set pieces, death-defying stunts and bone-crunching fights -- that just so happens to concern a real hero. The director Wilson Yip and the martial arts choreographer Sammo Hung supplement the fist-flying action with flashes of wit and ingenuity. They end up with one of the best martial-arts movies of the 21st century. (The sequels "Ip Man 2," "Ip Man 3," and "Ip Man 4: The Finale" will also leave Netflix on the 21st.)

'August: Osage County' (July 26)
Tracy Letts's 2007 Pulitzer Prize winner for drama gets the big-screen, prestige treatment, with Letts adapting the screenplay for a cast of heavy hitters. Meryl Streep gets the juicy leading role of Violet, the hard-living, straight talking, terminally ill matriarch of the family at the story's center; Julia Roberts is Barbara, Violet's oldest daughter and most frequent adversary. Letts's brilliant script magnificently captures how long-simmering resentments and decades' old slights are perpetually on simmer in a family like this, and the director John Wells smoothly orchestrates a cast that includes Chris Cooper, Benedict Cumberbatch, Juliette Lewis, Margo Martindale, Ewan McGregor, Dermot Mulroney and Sam Shepard.

'Flight' (July 31)
Denzel Washington was nominated for an Academy Award (for the sixth of eventually nine times) for his wrenching and powerful lead performance in this 2012 drama from the director Robert Zemeckis. Washington stars as "Whip" Whittaker, a commercial airline pilot whose quick thinking during a mechanical failure initially makes him a Sully-style hero. But when the crash is more thoroughly investigated, that perception is complicated considerably. What begins as a thrill ride becomes a nuanced addiction drama, with Washington playing Whip's descent into darkness with genuine pathos. The top-shelf supporting cast includes Don Cheadle, John Goodman, Melissa Leo and Kelly Reilly.

'Julie & Julia' (July 31)
Julia Child was an easy figure to impersonate but perhaps not so simple to inhabit. Meryl Streep masters the look and distinctive sound of the character but also finds the character's emotional spine, a sense of displacement that can be cured only by cooking; she shares that quality with Julie Powell (Amy Adams), the central character of the film's parallel story, in which a modern blogger attempts to recreate every recipe in Child's beloved book "Mastering the Art of French Cooking." The Childs story is decidedly more compelling, but the writer and director Nora Ephron (making her final film) makes ingenious connections between these two women and coaxes delightful performances from both actresses, as well as from Stanley Tucci and Chris Messina as their (mostly) supportive spouses.

Stream it here.
'The Pursuit of Happyness' (July 31)
This 2006 drama from Gabriele Muccino adapts the memoir of the motivational speaker Chris Gardner, who went from being a homeless single father to becoming a successful stockbroker and entrepreneur. The film focuses on Gardner's period of homelessness and the sacrifices he made while completing an unpaid internship at a prestigious firm. An Oscar-nominated Will Smith finds just the right notes as Gardner, whose pride and stubbornness prevented him from sharing his dire circumstances during his internship; Smith's real-life son Jaden plays Gardner's son, and their genuine emotional connection pulls the picture through its rougher patches. It's a formulaic piece of work but a nevertheless affecting one.

'Skyfall' (July 31)
The Daniel Craig era of the James Bond franchise reached its zenith with this 2012 installment, which combined the lean, mean, "Bourne"-influenced approach of recent Bond pictures with an Academy Award winning director (Sam Mendes), his regular team (including the ace cinematographer Roger Deakins and the composer Thomas Newman) and Javier Bardem, fresh off his own Oscar win for "No Country for Old Men," as a seductive villain. Mendes's elegant direction gives viewers the best of both worlds; the picture has the globe-trotting locations, bold action set pieces and unapologetic sensuality of classic Bond but the snappy pace and grounded action of contemporary blockbusters.

Stream it here.
'Stepmom' (July 31)
The "Home Alone" director Chris Columbus continued the softening of his touch that began with "Mrs. Doubtfire" (1993), moving from familial comedy to full on four-hanky drama with this 1998 tear-jerker. Julia Roberts plays the title character, a fashion photographer who is dating, and then marries, a much older, divorced father (Ed Harris). Susan Sarandon plays his ex-wife, whose difficulties maintaining a relationship with their two children -- and her combination of genuine dislike for and quiet jealousy of the new woman in their lives -- are complicated further by a terminal illness. It's not exactly a subtle piece of work, but it's an earnest one, and the leads find and play the complexities of what could have been cardboard characters.

Stream it here.
'Underworld' (July 31)
When this action-horror-sci-fi hybrid opened quietly in the fall of 2003, few could have predicted it would initiate a lucrative and long-running series -- five feature films (plus a video game), concluding with "Underworld: Blood Wars" (2017). But it shouldn't have been a surprise: This story of battles (and forbidden romance) between vampires, werewolves and humans was hitting the same early-21st century sweet spot of fantasy, gore and romance as the "Twilight" saga. And the films (particularly this first one) provided a rare opportunity for its star, Kate Beckinsale, to show what she could do with a full-on action-hero leading role.

Vietnam Bans 'Barbie' Movie Over South China Sea Map: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Greta Gerwig's upcoming film has been banned in the country for its use of a map depicting territory that both China and Vietnam claim as their own.
There will be no "Barbie" world in Vietnam this summer.
The Southeast Asian nation has banned the release of "Barbie," the upcoming film directed by Greta Gerwig, because of a scene that includes the so-called nine-dash line, a U-shaped dotted line on a map showing territory in the South China Sea that both China and Vietnam claim as their own.
The nine-dash line is used in Chinese maps to mark its claim over as much as 90 percent of the South China Sea.
While an international tribunal at The Hague ruled in 2016 that China had no legal basis for its claims, Beijing has yet to concede to the ruling and has instead sought to dominate the waters, carrying out aggressive incursions and developing military installations.
Vietnam, with its long-held acrimonious ties to China, said on Monday that the new film would not be released in the country because of its use of the line, according to Vi Kien Thanh, the head of the Vietnam Cinema Department. The decision was made by the National Film Appraisal and Classification Board, which is responsible for licensing and censoring foreign movies in Vietnam.
Responding to state media on Monday, Mr. Thanh confirmed that "Barbie" was banned because of "the illegal image of the 'cow's tongue line' in the film," using the common Vietnamese phrase for the nine-dash line.
Vietnam Plus, a state newspaper, wrote that the decision to include the line "distorts the truth, violates the law in general and violates sovereignty of Vietnamese territory in particular."
China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei all have territorial claims in the South China Sea, which include islands and other strategic maritime features.
"Barbie," which stars Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling and a host of other celebrities, was scheduled to be released in Vietnam on July 21. Some moviegoers in the country welcomed the government's ban. Hoang Xuan Bach, a 23-year-old university student, said the producers should have known better than to include the map.
"I hope this movie will flop," he said.
This is not the first time Vietnam has banned films for including scenes with the nine-dash line. "Uncharted," a 2022 action film by Sony featuring the actor Tom Holland, and DreamWorks' 2019 animation "Abominable," were both dropped from the nation's box offices for the same reason.

Full text: There is only one Ryan Seacrest. That may surprise anyone who looks closely at his overlapping radio and TV hosting gigs, which will soon include "Wheel of Fortune." When he steps into that new role, Mr. Seacrest will be seen and heard for some 29 hours a week.
Mr. Seacrest left "Live," the morning show he hosted with Kelly Ripa, in February after a six-year run. But he is still the host of "American Idol," the singing competition show that made him a household name. He is also the host of the syndicated radio programs "On Air With Ryan Seacrest" and "American Top 40 With Ryan Seacrest."
"American Idol" is typically on television for two hours a week, though at some points in the season there are two-hour episodes, twice a week, and the season finale is three hours. "On Air" is on the radio every morning. And "American Top 40" is another four hours every Sunday.
Add in "Wheel of Fortune," a 30-minute show that runs every weeknight, and that comes out to more than a full day each week of Ryan Seacrest. (And that doesn't count his "New Year's Rockin' Eve" special, which stretches into nearly six hours once a year.)
Granted, Mr. Seacrest may not be doing all of these programs at the same time. But he is essentially a one-man hosting monopoly, and while his schedule varies, in the past he has gotten up around 6 a.m. every day to get it all done.
With "Wheel of Fortune," though, he has big shoes to fill: Pat Sajak, who announced his retirement this month, is virtually synonymous with the nightly game show, and he had been its host since the 1980s.
"I'm truly humbled to be stepping into the footsteps of the legendary Pat Sajak," Mr. Seacrest said this week.
"We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks and other stresses."
Michael S. Barr, the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision, on the stress tests of the country's banks.
"At this point, it's cheaper than some of the cases of water we're selling in the back."
Andy Wagner, the manager of a beer and soda warehouse in Pennsylvania, about the sinking value of Bud Light.
"I believe that they're going to use Call of Duty somehow to damage us."
Jim Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, during testimony in a trial over whether Microsoft can move ahead in its acquisition of the maker of the video game Call of Duty.

This Broadcast TV Genre Continues to Thrive: G_ME SH_WS: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One by one, as streaming services grow in popularity, old standbys of the TV landscape are falling by the wayside.
The number of soap operas, a decades-old linchpin of daytime television, has fallen to a small handful. Hit daytime talk shows -- once hosted by the likes of Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres -- are becoming rarer by the year. Late-night shows are dwindling.
But one golden oldie is still standing strong: game shows.
ABC's lineup this fall is populated by many of them. On CBS, one of the longest-running shows, "The Price Is Right," is getting a new studio. And ratings for "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune," tops in the category, are among the most-watched programs in television -- at least outside of live sports. Both attract around nine million viewers on a typical night, and generate tens of millions of dollars in profit each year.
This week, Sony, the studio behind both "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune," gave the genre an emphatic vote of confidence. The company signed Ryan Seacrest, one of television's most recognizable personalities, to a long-term deal to replace Pat Sajak as the next host of "Wheel of Fortune."
The audience for Sony's two shows is, in the words of one executive at a rival studio, "shockingly big." Adam Nedeff, a researcher at the National Archives of Game Show History at the Strong National Museum of Play, said "Wheel of Fortune" "has survived even beyond the wildest expectations of success."
"'Wheel of Fortune' remains this giant," said Mr. Nedeff, who is the author of "Game Shows FAQ," a history of the format. "As the TV business changes, and streaming takes over the world, 'Wheel' is one of the things that endures on the old traditional model of TV."
Game shows offer two big benefits for executives: They are one of the least expensive programs to create, in part because many episodes can be filmed in a short period. And they are attractive to the largest demographic group that still consumes traditional television -- people 60 and older.
The median "Wheel of Fortune" viewer is in the oldest age bracket that Nielsen tracks: "65+." (The median ages of many of the higher-rated entertainment shows in prime time in the most recent television season -- "Survivor" (62.1), "Abbott Elementary" (60.2), "The Voice" (64.8) -- are not far behind.)
Among adults under 50, the demographic that most interests advertisers, the two game shows draw similar ratings: "Jeopardy!" averages 1.1 million viewers in that bracket and "Wheel of Fortune" one million.
Game shows have been around since the earliest days of television. From the quiz shows of the 1950s to the dating shows of the 1960s and 1970s, game shows have been as much a tradition for American television as football on Sunday afternoons.
The biggest success stories these days are thoroughbreds that have endured decades. "Family Feud," which began in 1976 and is currently hosted by Steve Harvey, draws nearly eight million viewers per episode, one of the highest viewership totals in all of syndicated television, according to Nielsen. CBS announced that "The Price Is Right," hosted by Drew Carey since 2007, will move into a "state-of-the-art facility" in Glendale, Calif., for the show's 52nd season this year.
Beginning in September, ABC's lineup will feature an hourlong edition of "Celebrity Jeopardy!" on Tuesday nights and a full Thursday prime-time lineup of "Celebrity Wheel of Fortune," "Press Your Luck" and "The $ 100,000 Pyramid."
Many of the current network prime-time game shows are not exactly ratings blockbusters. But their relatively small budgets make them easy for network executives to swallow, especially compared with the ballooning production costs of scripted television.
Sony's new deal with Mr. Seacrest suggests that the company plans for "Wheel of Fortune" to continue long into the future. The deal is expected to last through the early 2030s, a person who is familiar with it said.
Selecting Mr. Seacrest, however, is not without risk. When Merv Griffin created "Wheel of Fortune" in 1975 as television's answer to hangman, it spent its early years on ratings life support. It wasn't until Mr. Sajak and Vanna White, his co-host, joined in the early 1980s that the show took off. By the mid-1980s, it was drawing more than 40 million viewers a night.
Whether viewers tune out because Mr. Sajak isn't on the stage is an open question. He and Ms. White both have above-average favorable views among viewers, according to Q Score, the research firm that measures the likability of celebrities. Mr. Seacrest, however, is below average, according to Q Score, suggesting he may be polarizing to a segment of the audience.
Additionally, Ms. White's future with the show is uncertain. She is under contract for another year and is in negotiations for a new deal. Puck reported last week that Ms. White made significantly less money than Mr. Sajak and had not gotten a raise in nearly two decades. Many "Wheel of Fortune" fans on social media had expressed hope that she could replace Mr. Sajak -- if she departs, will droves of viewers leave with her?
Mr. Seacrest, though, has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to bring a steady hand to longtime franchises. He successfully took over Dick Clark's long-running New Year's Eve show. He assumed a seat that once belonged to Regis Philbin -- as well as Michael Strahan -- on "Live," the show he co-hosted for six years with Kelly Ripa. And in 2004 he took over the radio show once hosted by Casey Kasem.
Mr. Seacrest's rapid appointment -- Mr. Sajak said only two weeks ago that he would leave "Wheel of Fortune" in 2024 -- also is a way for Sony executives to avoid the succession crisis that enveloped "Jeopardy!" two years ago. In 2021, Sony executives quickly pushed out Alex Trebek's successor, Mike Richards, amid a public uproar after sexist and offensive comments Mr. Richards had made surfaced online. Sony eventually named Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik as Mr. Trebek's permanent successors.
Mr. Nedeff, the game show historian, said that as long as Mr. Seacrest recognized who the true star was, he should be successful.
"The big driver for the show is the game," he said. "The game is the star of the show."

Full text: Inventive riffs on the biopic, the movie musical, the classic Western and the celebrity bio-documentary are among the highlights of this month's roundup of under-the-radar streaming movies.
'Miles Ahead' (2016)
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
Viewers hoping for a traditional music-legend biopic in the style of "Walk the Line" or "Ray" will likely be baffled by this portrait of Miles Davis from Don Cheadle, who directs, co-writes and stars as the jazz great. Cheadle eschews the cradle-to-grave approach typical of such endeavors, instead building his narrative around a tall tale of Davis and a music journalist (Ewan McGregor) attempting to recover stolen tapes of his latest album. This mostly fictional fabrication gives Cheadle the leeway to create a playful, unpredictable and unexpected work -- a cinematic reflection of the music that made him famous. Emayatzy Corinealdi is heart-wrenching as Davis's wife Frances, while LaKeith Stanfield and Michael Stuhlbarg stand out in memorable supporting roles.
'The Lure' (2017)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Polish director Agnieszka Smoczynska made her feature directing debut with this exhilaratingly odd mash-up of cabaret musical, sex comedy and folk horror tale. Michalina Olszanska and Marta Mazurek are Gold and Silver, a pair of mermaid sisters who leave their comfortable undersea homes in pursuit of a handsome human (shades of "The Little Mermaid"), and end up bumping and grinding at a seedy nightclub. Smoczynska takes this literal fish-out-of-water tale and spices it up with unexpected genre flourishes; it's the kind of movie where, if you're not enjoying yourself, you merely have to wait a few scenes for it to become something else entirely.
'St. Vincent' (2014)
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The gruff but lovable geezer, the harried and hard-working single mom, the hooker with the heart of gold -- the character types on display in Theodore Melfi's comedy-drama are, to put it charitably, well-worn. Yet they're written with such sensitivity and played with such nuance by Bill Murray, Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts that the amiable viewer won't much mind; in fact, these overly familiar characters, and the stock situations Melfi writes them into, allow these actors to give them a good, old-fashioned, movie-star spit shine. All three pros are in fine form, with McCarthy particularly good in a lived-in, semi-dramatic turn that predicts her affecting work in "Can You Ever Forgive Me?" But the standout is young Jaeden Martell, charismatic and charming as the kid who brings them all together.
'The Old Way' (2023)
Stream it on Hulu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
So much of today's B-movie output consists of Xeroxed action movies and unimaginative horror that it's easy to forget how the Western was once a key corner of that world. This revenge melodrama from the director Brett Donowho serves as a reminder of the genre's vitality, even on a low budget. Though burdened by a thin script and a distractingly contemporary look, the picture's flaws are handily outweighed by the presence of Nicolas Cage in the leading role -- shockingly, his first turn in an oater in a 100-plus film career. He brings a hard-fought gravitas to this old gunslinger character, his familiar face sharpened by weary eyes and deeply set lines reminiscent of old-school Western stars like Randolph Scott and Audie Murphy.
'Run All Night' (2015)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This Liam Neeson vehicle was released the year after "John Wick," and feels, in retrospect, like the first of that film's many imitators, with Neeson as a former Mob enforcer who puts his own life in jeopardy when he kills his boss's trigger-happy son. Whatever its origins, this is one of Neeson's better late-period action efforts, thanks to a stellar supporting cast (including Vincent D'Onofrio, Ed Harris, Bruce McGill, Lois Smith plus a "John Wick: Chapter 2" co-star, Common) and a tightly focused Neeson performance; he has one especially good scene at the hospital bed of his dying mother, wearing the face of a man who knows how much he's let her down.
'The Exiles' (2023)
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Christine Choy, the initial subject of this documentary from the directors Violet Columbus and Ben Klein, is such a compelling, colorful character -- a foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, no nonsense local legend -- that one could watch a film merely of her telling stories and barking complaints. But Columbus and Klein are up to much more than that. "The Exiles" details how fellow documentarian Choy spent much of the summer of 1989 interviewing "political exiles" from China's Tiananmen Square protests (and subsequent massacre) and attending their Stateside events. Decades later, she rediscovers that footage and sets about reconnecting with her subjects, a process that results in poignant reflection and righteous indignation over how their cause was adopted but eventually discarded by the U.S. government.
'Call Me Kate' (2022)
Stream it on Netflix.
Netflix is notoriously reluctant to license films from Hollywood's golden era (frankly, it can be hard to find much of anything from the 20th century in general). But they will offer up the occasional documentary study of cinema history, such as "Five Came Back," "Is That Black Enough for You?!?," and this recent British documentary valentine to the one and only Katharine Hepburn. The writer and director Lorna Tucker draws from rare archival audio and home movies, elegantly assembling a portrait that both celebrates and demystifies her considerable legend. Intimate and unapologetic, it leaves the viewer with a keener understanding of Hepburn -- the person and the persona.
'Tim's Vermeer' (2014)
Stream it on Hulu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The current hullabaloo over A.I. and visual art makes this a fine time to revisit this provocative and pointed documentary, written by the magicians and self-appointed debunkers Penn and Teller, narrated by the former and directed by the latter. They detail the efforts of inventor Tim Jenison to both investigate and replicate the methodology of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, whose photorealistic paintings have impressed admirers and challenged skeptics for years. Assembled with the pair's usual and potent mixture of cynicism and curiosity, it's a compelling journey into the past with implications for the future.

This Broadcast TV Genre Continues to Thrive. (What Are Game Shows?)

Full text: Enlarge this image.
One by one, as streaming services grow in popularity, old standbys of the TV landscape are falling by the wayside.
The number of soap operas, a decades-old linchpin of daytime television, has fallen to a small handful. Hit daytime talk shows — once hosted by the likes of Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres — are becoming rarer by the year. Late-night shows are dwindling.
But one golden oldie is still standing strong: game shows.
ABC’s lineup this fall is populated by many of them. On CBS, one of the longest-running shows, “The Price Is Right,” is getting a new studio. And ratings for “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune,” tops in the category, are among the most-watched programs in television — at least outside of live sports. Both attract around 9 million viewers on a typical night and generate tens of millions of dollars in profit each year.
This week, Sony, the studio behind both “Jeopardy!” and “Wheel of Fortune,” gave the genre an emphatic vote of confidence. The company signed Ryan Seacrest, one of television’s most recognizable personalities, to a long-term deal to replace Pat Sajak as the next host of “Wheel of Fortune.”
The audience for Sony’s two shows is, in the words of one executive at a rival studio, “shockingly big.” Adam Nedeff, a researcher at the National Archives of Game Show History at the Strong National Museum of Play, said “Wheel of Fortune” “has survived even beyond the wildest expectations of success.”
“‘Wheel of Fortune’ remains this giant,” said Nedeff, who is the author of “Game Shows FAQ,” a history of the format. “As the TV business changes and streaming takes over the world, ‘Wheel’ is one of the things that endures on the old traditional model of TV.”
Game shows offer two big benefits for executives: They are one of the least expensive programs to create, in part because many episodes can be filmed in a short period. And they are attractive to the largest demographic group that still consumes traditional television: people age 60 and older.
The median “Wheel of Fortune” viewer is in the oldest age bracket that Nielsen tracks: “65+.” (The median ages of many of the higher-rated entertainment shows in prime time in the most recent television season — “Survivor” (62.1), “Abbott Elementary” (60.2), “The Voice” (64.8) — are not far behind.)
Among adults younger than 50, the demographic that most interests advertisers, the two game shows draw similar ratings: “Jeopardy!” averages 1.1 million viewers in that bracket and “Wheel of Fortune” 1 million.
Game shows have been around since the earliest days of television. From the quiz shows of the 1950s to the dating shows of the 1960s and 1970s, game shows have been as much a tradition for American television as football on Sunday afternoons.
The biggest success stories these days are thoroughbreds that have endured decades. “Family Feud,” which began in 1976 and is currently hosted by Steve Harvey, draws nearly 8 million viewers per episode, one of the highest viewership totals in all of syndicated television, according to Nielsen. CBS announced that “The Price Is Right,” hosted by Drew Carey since 2007, will move into a “state-of-the-art facility” in Glendale, California, for the show’s 52nd season this year.
Beginning in September, ABC’s lineup will feature an hourlong edition of “Celebrity Jeopardy!” on Tuesday nights and a full Thursday prime-time lineup of “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune,” “Press Your Luck” and “The $100,000 Pyramid.”
Many of the current network prime-time game shows are not exactly ratings blockbusters. But their relatively small budgets make them easy for network executives to swallow, especially compared with the ballooning production costs of scripted television.
Sony’s new deal with Seacrest suggests that the company plans for “Wheel of Fortune” to continue long into the future. The deal is expected to last through the early 2030s, a person who is familiar with it said.
Selecting Seacrest, however, is not without risk. When Merv Griffin created “Wheel of Fortune” in 1975 as television’s answer to hangman, it spent its early years on ratings life support. It wasn’t until Sajak and Vanna White, his co-host, joined in the early 1980s that the show took off. By the mid-1980s, it was drawing more than 40 million viewers a night.
Whether viewers tune out because Sajak isn’t on the stage is an open question. He and White both have above-average favorable views among viewers, according to Q Score, the research firm that measures the likability of celebrities. Seacrest, however, is below average, according to Q Score, suggesting he may be polarizing to a segment of the audience.
Additionally, White’s future with the show is uncertain. She is under contract for another year and is in negotiations for a new deal. Puck reported last week that White made significantly less money than Sajak and had not gotten a raise in nearly two decades. Many “Wheel of Fortune” fans on social media had expressed hope that she could replace Sajak; if she departs, will droves of viewers leave with her?
Seacrest, though, has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to bring a steady hand to longtime franchises. He successfully took over Dick Clark’s long-running New Year’s Eve show. He assumed a seat that once belonged to Regis Philbin — as well as Michael Strahan — on “Live,” the show he co-hosted for six years with Kelly Ripa. And in 2004, he took over the radio show once hosted by Casey Kasem.
Seacrest’s rapid appointment — Sajak said only two weeks ago that he would leave “Wheel of Fortune” in 2024 — also is a way for Sony executives to avoid the succession crisis that enveloped “Jeopardy!” two years ago. In 2021, Sony executives quickly pushed out Alek Trebek’s successor, Mike Richards, amid a public uproar after sexist and offensive comments Richards had made surfaced online. Sony eventually named Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik as Trebek’s permanent successors.
Nedeff, the game show historian, said that as long as Seacrest recognized who the true star was, he should be successful.
“The big driver for the show is the game,” he said. “The game is the star of the show.”

5 Classical Music Albums You Can Listen to Right Now: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/5-classical-music-albums-you-can-listen-right-now/docview/2831149447/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Wynton Marsalis symphony, a "Das Lied von der Erde" with Christian Gerhaher and Piotr Beczala, and a Paola Prestini opera are among the highlights.
Wynton Marsalis: Symphony No. 4, 'The Jungle'
Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra; Melbourne Symphony Orchestra; Nicholas Buc, conductor (Blue Engine)
Every Wynton Marsalis symphony features ear-catching material. But some have suffered from bloat. His first, "All Rise," stretched across two CDs in a 2002 release. The third, "Swing Symphony," had to be truncated by a movement when it received its American premiere in 2010. The same thing happened when the fourth, nicknamed "The Jungle," landed at Lincoln Center in 2016.
This premiere recording of the full piece, however, shows Marsalis at his considerable best -- for all of its 65 minutes. The hurtling, unpredictable writing that launches "The Jungle" may initially seem of a piece with John Adams-style post-Minimalism in its frenetic patterns. But when the rhythm section of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra kicks in on top of it all, there's a steady swing feel. And not a sagacious orchestral adaptation of swing -- as in Adams's "City Noir" -- but the genuine article. The composite style is a marvel.
The lengthy third section works like a cross-section of what you might hear if you attended multiple concerts on the same evening: It riffs on Copland's pastoral sound, while also deriving succor from the lyricism of Ellington's "Come Sunday" and the pleasing tartness of Stravinsky's American-informed, Neo-Classical efforts. A city-in-crisis finale, titled "Struggle in the Digital Market," is similarly teeming and more aggressive, yet never overstuffed. In the more compact movements, you'll find tributes to Latin jazz and, as ever, traces of the influence of Marsalis's native New Orleans.
More than just Marsalis's best symphony, "The Jungle" also feels like one of his most distinguished works, period -- capable of standing with "Citi Movement (Griot New York)," "Blood on the Fields" and his more recent Violin Concerto. I wouldn't wish it a minute shorter. SETH COLTER WALLS
Paola Prestini: 'Edward Tulane'
Jack Swanson, tenor; Minnesota Opera Chorus and Orchestra; Lidiya Yankovskaya, conductor (VIA Records)
"The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane," by the novelist Kate DiCamillo, is a classic children's story: direct, unsparing and sometimes gruesome in pursuit of a simple moral truth.
Paola Prestini's operatic adaptation, which she dedicated to her son, honors that sentiment. From the first measures of this live recording of the premiere at Minnesota Opera, conducted with impressive cohesion by Lidiya Yankovskaya, the swarming strings and piercing winds affirm that there will be no coddling.
Edward Tulane is a rabbit doll made of china -- precious, vain, selfish -- who passes through hardships and the hands of several owners. They include a fisherman and his wife, a drifter and his dog, and a brother and his ailing sister -- all portrayed with conviction by an ensemble cast -- and they whisper their deepest feelings into his fluffy ears. Prestini surfaces those messy emotions in music of candid vulnerability, making Edward's aloof, prim silence all the more glaring.
As a battered and broken Edward who finally allows himself to love back, the tenor Jack Swanson sings with an elegant, emotionally courageous sound. The hope in his voice tilts toward regret for the feelings Edward didn't reciprocate.
Prestini's vivid tableaux, fashioned from Mark Campbell's concise libretto, don't necessarily proffer catchy melodies. When Edward's owners gather for the Act I finale, the music could have soared. But instead it welled up from below, bringing comfort in solidity. OUSSAMA ZAHR
Anna Thorvaldsdottir: 'ARCHORA/AION'
Iceland Symphony Orchestra; Eva Ollikainen, conductor (Sono Luminus)
Among the many wonders of Anna Thorvaldsdottir's music -- exquisitely honed timbres, an intricate play of shadow and light -- perhaps the most mysterious is the way it can sound so static yet be in a state of constant (if sometimes glacial) change. Take "ARCHORA," the first of two spacious orchestral works on this welcome new release. It opens with a D flat in the low strings, winds and brass, a tenebrous and flatly final sound incapable of being dislodged by the thwacks and thumps surrounding it. Soon, though, a series of downward-sliding melodies in the violins begins to tug the music away; the pedal point returns, but feels slightly less fixed. By the time a long, deeply lyrical line unfolds about halfway through, the music is in a different world, even as you're not quite sure how it left the old one.
This craftsmanship -- a meticulous fusion of pacing, structure and coloring -- is also at work in the three-movement "AION," although the canvas is larger, and the mood less uniform. There is a stronger sense of direction: moments of stillness repeatedly disrupted by violent outbursts, as if the piece were evoking the weather system on some alien planet. The triumphant conclusion, again in D flat, seems both logical and a shock. Both pieces confirm the impression that Thorvaldsdottir is incapable of writing music that doesn't immediately transfix an open-eared listener. The Iceland Symphony Orchestra and Eva Ollikainen, its chief conductor, offer glowing performances that have been beautifully captured by Sono Luminus. DAVID WEININGER
Mahler: 'Das Lied von der Erde'
Piotr Beczala, tenor; Christian Gerhaher, baritone; Gerold Huber, piano (Sony)
You may start to feel for Piotr Beczala a little as this recording, of Mahler's own piano version of his late song cycle, goes on. It's not so much that there is anything wrong with how the Polish tenor delivers his three numbers. Far from it: In both of his high-set drinking songs, "Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde" and "Der Trinker im Frühling," he displays ample power and is able to point out aspects of the text that few of his colleagues have been able to illuminate with a full orchestra behind them.
But even the excellence of a Beczala sounds straightforward compared with the imperial majesty of a lifelong musical partnership between the baritone Christian Gerhaher and his best friend, Gerold Huber. Rarely has what makes them so special been as audible as it is here, as one song gives way to another: Huber may be exemplary in support of Beczala, but he is magical in collaboration with Gerhaher, down to the minutest shade of tone, the last detail of line.
Listen to how they sway in "Am Ufer," known as "Von der Schönheit" in the orchestral version, as Gerhaher sings of perfume drifting through the air; or consider the bells that Huber seems to summon in his tone at the end of "Der Abschied," as Gerhaher refines his voice until it becomes almost spectral, floating into eternity. DAVID ALLEN
'Many Hands: The Piano Music of David Del Tredici, Vols. 2-4'
Marc Peloquin, piano (Albany)
The music of the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Del Tredici still sounds endearing in its playfulness. For the second time in a year, we have a reminder of this thanks to a release from the Albany label: first, a stellar set of his psychedelic 1970s orchestral pieces, and now, this volume from Marc Peloquin, a longtime Del Tredici champion.
The first disc here is a reissue, but the second and third are new. Particularly touching among those: "Wildwood Etude," which sets the second movement from Del Tredici's as-yet-unreleased song cycle "Gay Life." Particularly playful is the miniature "Opposites Attract," which references Wagner and Virgil Thomson without forgetting to contribute some melodic invention of its own.
The sequencing is far from chronological. One minute you may be hearing the elegiac and stately 21st-century works that make up "Late in the Game." Another, you'll be hearing the atonal student works of "Fantasy Pieces," from 1959-60. Despite the breadth of the history covered here, Peloquin's touch is admirably sensitive to the cantabile quality that Del Tredici is apt to bring to any harmonic idiom. As a result, this valuable set does more than hang together well; it also speaks to the sturdiness of its composer's catalog. SETH COLTER WALLS

Chiefs of Microsoft and Activision Testify That Merger Would Benefit Consumers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In federal court, Satya Nadella and Bobby Kotick opposed an attempt by the F.T.C. to delay Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of a video game giant.
Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, appeared in federal court on Wednesday to pledge his support for open platforms and consumer choice, underscoring the tech giant's commitment to closing its $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over regulators' objections.
"If it was up to me, I would love to get rid of the entire 'exclusives on consoles,"' Mr. Nadella testified, rebutting claims from tech regulators that Microsoft's deal for the video game giant would curtail competition and restrict Activision's games only to players on Microsoft's Xbox console. "I have no love for that world."
The fourth day of a hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco that could determine the deal's outcome was the highest-profile session, with appearances by Mr. Nadella and Activision's chief executive, Bobby Kotick.
The Federal Trade Commission's challenge of the blockbuster acquisition, led by its chair, Lina Khan, is viewed as a test of whether more aggressive efforts to curb tech giants can be successful. The F.T.C. is seeking a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the companies from closing the deal before the agency has the chance to argue its case in its internal court.
Microsoft has said such a lengthy delay would most likely doom the deal, a perspective that Mr. Kotick shared in his testimony on Wednesday.
The F.TC. has argued that the merger would harm competition in the video game industry and hurt consumers, because Microsoft could pull Activision's games, like Call of Duty, from its rival Sony's PlayStation console. Mr. Kotick promised that he had no intention of doing so, though the decision will not ultimately be his if his company is acquired.
"You would have a revolt if you were to remove the game from one platform," Mr. Kotick said. "It would cause reputational damage to the company." Mr. Nadella likewise said he would not withhold Call of Duty.
Under Ms. Khan, the F.T.C. has sued Meta, Microsoft and Amazon, arguing that Big Tech's immense power over communications, social media and online commerce allows the companies to build monopolies and harm consumers.
After Microsoft announced early last year that it intended to reshape its Xbox business by buying Activision, the company struck agreements with other video game companies, like Nintendo, to show regulators that the deal would benefit gamers and not curtail access to Activision's games.
Most government agencies, including the European Commission, were convinced. But the F.T.C. and the Competition and Markets Authority in Britain are trying to block the deal.
Court arguments have focused on the practice of exclusivity -- releasing a highly anticipated game only on one console. Microsoft has repeatedly promised it will not make Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox if it acquires Activision, and offered Sony a contract putting that guarantee in writing.
But the F.T.C. argued in court last week that Microsoft had moved swiftly to buy ZeniMax Media and its slate of gaming studios for $ 7.5 billion in 2020 when it realized that Sony might pay to make one of ZeniMax's important upcoming games, Starfield, exclusive to PlayStation. New ZeniMax titles, including Starfield, are now exclusive to the Xbox.
Jim Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, testified in a recorded video deposition that he thought that even if Call of Duty remained on PlayStation, Microsoft would try to "drive PlayStation gamers to the Xbox platforms" by somehow degrading the Call of Duty experience on PlayStation.
"I believe that they're going to use Call of Duty somehow to damage us," Mr. Ryan said.
But Mr. Nadella testified that he opposed a walled-off approach to gaming.
"I grew up in a company that always believed that software should run on as many platforms as possible," he said. "And I believe in that."
Microsoft has sought to portray itself as a distant third in a three-player console market dominated by Nintendo and Sony. Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, said that as a third-place competitor, Xbox was "not a robust business."
Mr. Spencer did acknowledge that Microsoft has had discussions about potentially excluding Activision games other than Call of Duty from PlayStation.
The F.T.C. has argued that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision would also give it an unfair advantage in gaming subscription services and the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley is expected to decide whether to grant the injunction before July 18, the date the deal is expected to close. At times, her courtroom questions have been skeptical of some of the F.T.C.'s arguments.
The F.T.C., for example, tried to get Mr. Spencer to swear he would put Call of Duty on PlayStation for at least 10 years, no matter what terms Sony requested as part of that agreement. Judge Corley seemed to feel that such a blanket promise was unrealistic, especially if Sony asked for something unreasonable, like receiving Call of Duty for free.
"Well, it's not going to be for zero dollars," Judge Corley said, sounding impatient. "That was understood."

Full text: The game show has demonstrated remarkable durability even as traditional television has declined in the wake of streaming entertainment.
Ryan Seacrest, the dexterous Hollywood master of ceremonies, was named the next host of "Wheel of Fortune" on Tuesday, succeeding the longtime host Pat Sajak in 2024.
The selection of a star like Mr. Seacrest by Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind the show, is a big bet on "Wheel of Fortune." The show has demonstrated remarkable durability even as traditional television has declined in the wake of streaming entertainment.
The swift decision by Sony executives, made just two weeks after Mr. Sajak announced he would step down next year, also suggests that they are hoping to avoid the succession fiasco that nearly overwhelmed their other hit game show, "Jeopardy!"
Vanna White, Mr. Sajak's longtime "Wheel of Fortune" co-host, is under contract for another year, and is in negotiations to continue with the show, said a person with knowledge of the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
"I'm truly humbled to be stepping into the footsteps of the legendary Pat Sajak," Mr. Seacrest said in a statement. "I can't wait to continue the tradition of spinning the wheel and working alongside the great Vanna White."
In replacing Mr. Sajak, Mr. Seacrest will face a test: He'll be replacing a host who is virtually synonymous with the show, like Bob Barker was with "The Price Is Right" or Alex Trebek with "Jeopardy!"
Mr. Sajak, a former Los Angeles weatherman, as well as Ms. White, came to "Wheel of Fortune" in the early 1980s and turned the show into a major hit. Within a few years, "Wheel of Fortune" spawned board games, video games, casino slot machines and, eventually, a prime-time spinoff, "Celebrity Wheel of Fortune."
Though "Wheel of Fortune" hardly holds the same spot it once did in American culture -- at its height in the 1980s, the game show had a nightly audience of more than 40 million viewers -- it remains one of the most popular entertainment programs on television.
In the most recent television season, "Wheel of Fortune" averaged 8.6 million viewers a night, just a shade behind the 9.1 million who watched "Jeopardy!," according to Nielsen. Those audiences are nearly as big as anything on prime-time TV, aside from football games.
Hosting a popular game show, which requires little more than a few days of work a month, is one of the most coveted jobs in all of entertainment. Landing the job adds another notch to Mr. Seacrest's résumé, which has included stints as a daytime talk show host, competition series host, red carpet interviewer, radio host and New Year's Eve master of ceremonies.
Mr. Seacrest left "Live," the morning show mainstay that he hosted with Kelly Ripa, this year after a successful six-year run. He continues to host ABC's "American Idol," which garnered an audience of more than six million this past television season, according to Nielsen.
When Mr. Sajak announced on June 12 that he would be leaving the show, many in the entertainment industry thought the search for his replacement could take months. Still, succession speculation began immediately, and on social media many "Wheel of Fortune" fans called for Ms. White to take over as host. Puck reported last week that she was in negotiations for a new "Wheel of Fortune" contract.
Underscoring just how much celebrity entertainers covet the position, Joy Behar remarked on "The View" two weeks ago that her co-host Whoopi Goldberg had interest in hosting "Wheel of Fortune."
"I want that job," Ms. Goldberg replied definitively, to the cheers of the studio audience. "I think it would be lots of fun."
After Mr. Trebek died in 2020, Sony trotted out a rotating cast of potential "Jeopardy!" successors, who filled in as guest host for a week or two at a time. In 2021, Sony announced that Mike Richards, the show's executive producer, would take over hosting duties at "Jeopardy!"
But within a matter of days, reports surfaced that Mr. Richards had made a series of sexist and offensive remarks years earlier, and, amid a public uproar, he was pushed out of the job -- first as host and then as executive producer of the show. It took nearly another year for Sony to announce that Ken Jennings and Mayim Bialik would be the permanent hosts of "Jeopardy!"
Over the last year, the drama surrounding "Jeopardy!" has settled down considerably, and the show has sustained its strong ratings.
Two weeks ago, Mr. Jennings was asked on "The View" who should take replace Mr. Sajak.
"That's an interesting question," Mr. Jennings said, adding: "Hopefully, 'Wheel' has got an envelope somewhere that says, 'What to do when Pat packs it in."'

John Goodenough, Who Changed World With Lithium Ions, Dies at 100: [Biography]

Full text: An unassuming professor who remained active into his 90s, he is credited with the breakthrough that gave rise to the batteries powering today's electronic devices.
John B. Goodenough, the scientist who shared the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his crucial role in developing the revolutionary lithium-ion battery, the rechargeable power pack that is ubiquitous in today's wireless electronic devices and electric and hybrid vehicles, died on Sunday at an assisted living facility in Austin, Texas. He was 100.
The University of Texas at Austin, where Dr. Goodenough was a professor of engineering, announced his death.
Until the announcement of his selection as a Nobel laureate, Dr. Goodenough was relatively unknown beyond scientific and academic circles and the commercial titans who exploited his work. He achieved his laboratory breakthrough in 1980 at the University of Oxford, where he created a battery that has populated the planet with smartphones, laptop and tablet computers, lifesaving medical devices like cardiac defibrillators, and clean, quiet plug-in vehicles, including many Teslas, that can be driven on long trips, lessen the impact of climate change and might someday replace gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
Like most modern technological advances, the powerful, lightweight, rechargeable lithium-ion battery is a product of incremental insights by scientists, lab technicians and commercial interests over decades. But for those familiar with the battery's story, Dr. Goodenough's contribution is regarded as the crucial link in its development, a linchpin of chemistry, physics and engineering on a molecular scale.
In 2019, when he was 97 and still active in research at the University of Texas, Dr. Goodenough became the oldest Nobel Prize winner in history when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that he would share the $ 900,000 award with two others who made major contributions to the battery's development: M. Stanley Whittingham, a professor at Binghamton University, State University of New York, and Akira Yoshino, an honorary fellow for the Asahi Kasei Corporation in Tokyo and a professor at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan.
Dr. Goodenough received no royalties for his work on the battery, only his salary for six decades as a scientist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Oxford and the University of Texas. Caring little for money, he signed away most of his rights. He shared patents with colleagues and donated stipends that came with his awards to research and scholarships.
A congenial presence since 1986 on the Austin campus, where he amazed colleagues by remaining active and inventive well into his 90s, he had been working in recent years on a superbattery that he said might someday store and transport wind, solar and nuclear energy, transforming the national electric grid and perhaps revolutionizing the place of electric cars in middle-class life, with unlimited travel ranges and the ease of recharging in minutes.
A devoted Episcopalian, Dr. Goodenough kept a tapestry of the Last Supper on the wall of his laboratory. Its depiction of the Apostles in fervent conversation, like scientists disputing a theory, reminded him, he said, of a divine power that had opened doors for him in a life that had begun with little promise.
He was, he said in a memoir, "Witness to Grace" (2008), the unwanted child of an agnostic Yale University professor of religion and a mother with whom he never bonded. Friendless except for three siblings, a family dog and a maid, he grew up lonely and dyslexic in an emotionally distant household. He was sent to a private boarding school at 12 and rarely heard from his parents.
With patience, counseling and intense struggles for self-improvement, he overcame his reading disabilities. He studied Latin and Greek at Groton and mastered mathematics at Yale, meteorology in the Army Air Forces during World War II, and physics under Clarence Zener, Edward Teller and Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago, where he earned a doctorate in 1952.
At M.I.T.'s Lincoln Laboratory in the 1950s and '60s, he was a member of teams that helped lay the groundwork for random access memory (RAM) in computers and developed plans for the nation's first air defense system. In 1976, as federal funding for his M.I.T. work ended, he moved to Oxford to teach and manage a chemistry lab, where he began his research on batteries.
Essentially, a battery is a device that makes electrically charged atoms, known as ions, move from one side to another, creating an electrical current that powers anything hooked up to the battery. The two sides, called electrodes, hold charges -- a negative one called an anode, and a positive one called a cathode. The medium between them, through which the ions travel, is an electrolyte.
When a battery releases energy, positively charged ions shuttle from the anode to the cathode, creating a current. A rechargeable battery is plugged into a socket to draw electricity, forcing the ions to shuttle back to the anode, where they are stored until needed again. Materials used for the anode, cathode and electrolyte determine the quantity and speed of the ions, and thus the battery's power.
The modern world has long sought batteries that are safe, reliable, inexpensive and powerful. The first true battery was invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta, who stacked disks of copper and zinc and linked them with a cloth soaked in salty water. With wires connected to discs on both ends, the battery produced a stable current. Early car batteries were mostly lead-acid and bulky, capable of running ignitions and accessories, like lights, but until recent years not powerful enough to drive engines. Consumer electronics used zinc-carbon or nickel-cadmium batteries.
Just as Dr. Goodenough arrived at Oxford, Exxon patented a design by Dr. Whittingham, a British chemist employed by the company, for the first rechargeable battery using lithium for its negative electrode, and titanium disulfide, not previously used in batteries, for its positive electrode. It seemed a breakthrough because ions of lithium, the lightest metal, produced high voltage and worked at room temperature. The Whittingham battery was an advancement, but it proved impractical. If overcharged or repeatedly recharged, it caught fire or exploded.
Seeking to improve on the design, Dr. Goodenough also used lithium ions. But his insight, gleaned from experiments with two postdoctoral assistants, was to craft the cathode with layers of lithium and cobalt oxide, which created pockets for the lithium ions. The arrangement also produced a higher voltage and made the battery far less volatile. He succeeded after four years.
"It was the first lithium-ion cathode with the capacity, when installed in a battery, to power both compact and relatively large devices, a quality that would make it far superior to anything on the market," Steve LeVine wrote in "The Powerhouse: Inside the Invention of a Battery to Save the World" (2015).
"It would result," he added, "in a battery with twice to three times the energy of any other rechargeable room-temperature battery, and thus could be made much smaller and deliver the same or better performance."
There was little interest in his discovery at first. Oxford declined to patent it, and Dr. Goodenough signed the rights over to a British atomic energy research organization. Scientists in Japan and Switzerland, meanwhile, found that lithium layered with graphitic carbon improved the anode.
Dr. Yoshino's contribution, the Swedish Academy said, was to eliminate pure lithium from the battery, instead using only lithium ions, which are safer. He created a commercially viable lithium-ion battery for the Asahi Kasei Corporation, which started selling the technology in 1991.
In 1991, Sony, recognizing the commercial potential of the emerging technology, combined Dr. Goodenough's cathode and a carbon anode to produce the world's first safe rechargeable lithium-ion battery for the marketplace. Applications proliferated. Labs found new ways to shrink battery sizes, yoke them together and raise energy output. A revolution in wireless mobile devices and vehicular applications exploded.
"Goodenough's original lithium-cobalt-oxide cathode structure is still used in the lithium-ion batteries found in almost all personal electronics like smartphones and tablets," Helen Gregg wrote in The University of Chicago Magazine in 2016. "When he was tinkering with oxides back at Oxford, Goodenough had no idea of the impact his battery would have."
John Bannister Goodenough was born in Jena, Germany, on July 25, 1922, the second of four children of Erwin and Helen (Lewis) Goodenough. His father was finishing graduate studies at Oxford University, and the family returned to the United States when John was an infant and settled in Woodbridge, Conn., after his father joined the Yale faculty to teach comparative religion.
In an interview for this obituary in 2017, Dr. Goodenough said that he and his siblings, Ward, James and Hester, had "mismatched" parents who were "aloof" with their children. John also struggled with undiagnosed dyslexia and was regarded as a backward student at local primary schools. As a teenager at the Groton School in Massachusetts, he made adjustments to cope with dyslexia.
"I overcame it in a sense," he recalled. "I was able to read mechanically. And I covered my tracks a bit by avoiding English and history, and focusing on mathematics and languages -- six years of Latin and four of Greek." Rigorous educational standards at Groton and Yale also gave structure to his life, he said.
He graduated at the top of his Groton class in 1940 and received a scholarship to Yale, where he majored in mathematics, tutored and worked other jobs to pay for his education. He had almost completed coursework for his bachelor's degree in 1943 when he was called to active duty in the wartime Army Air Forces. He received his degree after Yale gave him credit for a military meteorology course. He served in Newfoundland and the Azores.
After the war, he received a government scholarship to study physics at the University of Chicago. He earned a master's degree in 1951 and a doctorate a year later. After working briefly for Westinghouse, he began his career at M.I.T.
In 1951, he married Irene Wiseman. They had no children. She died in 2016. He is survived by a half sister, Ursula W. Goodenough, and a half brother, Daniel A. Goodenough, both of whom are emeritus biology professors.
Dr. Goodenough held the Virginia H. Cockrell centennial chair in engineering at the University of Texas. He wrote eight books and more than 800 articles for scientific journals. His honors included the Japan Prize, the Enrico Fermi Award, the Charles Stark Draper Prize, the Welch Award in Chemistry and the National Medal of Science, which he was given by President Barack Obama in 2011.

He achieved his laboratory breakthrough in 1980 at the University of Oxford, where he created a battery that has populated the planet with smartphones, laptop and tablet computers, lifesaving medical devices like cardiac defibrillators, and clean, quiet plug-in vehicles, including many Teslas, that can be driven on long trips, lessen the impact of climate change and might someday replace gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
Like most modern technological advances, the powerful, lightweight, rechargeable lithium-ion battery is a product of incremental insights by scientists, lab technicians and commercial interests over decades. But for those familiar with the battery’s story, Goodenough’s contribution is regarded as the crucial link in its development, a linchpin of chemistry, physics and engineering on a molecular scale.
In 2019, when he was 97 and still active in research at the University of Texas, Goodenough became the oldest Nobel Prize winner in history when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that he would share the $900,000 award with two others who made major contributions to the battery’s development: M. Stanley Whittingham, a professor at Binghamton University, State University of New York, and Akira Yoshino, an honorary fellow for the Asahi Kasei Corp. in Tokyo and a professor at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan.
Goodenough received no royalties for his work on the battery, only his salary for six decades as a scientist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Oxford and the University of Texas. Caring little for money, he signed away most of his rights. He shared patents with colleagues and donated stipends that came with his awards to research and scholarships.
A congenial presence since 1986 on the Austin campus, where he amazed colleagues by remaining active and inventive well into his 90s, he had been working in recent years on a superbattery that he said might someday store and transport wind, solar and nuclear energy, transforming the national electric grid and perhaps revolutionizing the place of electric cars in middle-class life, with unlimited travel ranges and the ease of recharging in minutes.
A devoted Episcopalian, Goodenough kept a tapestry of the Last Supper on the wall of his laboratory. Its depiction of the Apostles in fervent conversation, like scientists disputing a theory, reminded him, he said, of a divine power that had opened doors for him in a life that had begun with little promise.
He was, he said in a memoir, “Witness to Grace” (2008), the unwanted child of an agnostic Yale University professor of religion and a mother with whom he never bonded. Friendless except for three siblings, a family dog and a maid, he grew up lonely and dyslexic in an emotionally distant household. He was sent to a private boarding school at 12 and rarely heard from his parents.
With patience, counseling and intense struggles for self-improvement, he overcame his reading disabilities. He studied Latin and Greek at Groton and mastered mathematics at Yale, meteorology in the Army Air Forces during World War II, and physics under Clarence Zener, Edward Teller and Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago, where he earned a doctorate in 1952.
At MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory in the 1950s and ’60s, he was a member of teams that helped lay the groundwork for random access memory (RAM) in computers and developed plans for the nation’s first air defense system. In 1976, as federal funding for his MIT work ended, he moved to Oxford to teach and manage a chemistry lab, where he began his research on batteries.
Essentially, a battery is a device that makes electrically charged atoms, known as ions, move from one side to another, creating an electrical current that powers anything hooked up to the battery. The two sides, called electrodes, hold charges — a negative one called an anode, and a positive one called a cathode. The medium between them, through which the ions travel, is an electrolyte.
When a battery releases energy, positively charged ions shuttle from the anode to the cathode, creating a current. A rechargeable battery is plugged into a socket to draw electricity, forcing the ions to shuttle back to the anode, where they are stored until needed again. Materials used for the anode, cathode and electrolyte determine the quantity and speed of the ions, and thus the battery’s power.
The modern world has long sought batteries that are safe, reliable, inexpensive and powerful. The first true battery was invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta, who stacked disks of copper and zinc and linked them with a cloth soaked in salty water. With wires connected to discs on both ends, the battery produced a stable current. Early car batteries were mostly lead-acid and bulky, capable of running ignitions and accessories, like lights, but until recent years not powerful enough to drive engines. Consumer electronics used zinc-carbon or nickel-cadmium batteries.
Just as Goodenough arrived at Oxford, Exxon patented a design by Whittingham, a British chemist employed by the company, for the first rechargeable battery using lithium for its negative electrode, and titanium disulfide, not previously used in batteries, for its positive electrode. It seemed a breakthrough because ions of lithium, the lightest metal, produced high voltage and worked at room temperature. The Whittingham battery was an advancement, but it proved impractical. If overcharged or repeatedly recharged, it caught fire or exploded.
Seeking to improve on the design, Goodenough also used lithium ions. But his insight, gleaned from experiments with two postdoctoral assistants, was to craft the cathode with layers of lithium and cobalt oxide, which created pockets for the lithium ions. The arrangement also produced a higher voltage and made the battery far less volatile. He succeeded after four years.
“It was the first lithium-ion cathode with the capacity, when installed in a battery, to power both compact and relatively large devices, a quality that would make it far superior to anything on the market,” Steve LeVine wrote in “The Powerhouse: Inside the Invention of a Battery to Save the World” (2015).
“It would result,” he added, “in a battery with twice to three times the energy of any other rechargeable room-temperature battery, and thus could be made much smaller and deliver the same or better performance.”
There was little interest in his discovery at first. Oxford declined to patent it, and Goodenough signed the rights over to a British atomic energy research organization. Scientists in Japan and Switzerland, meanwhile, found that lithium layered with graphitic carbon improved the anode.
Yoshino’s contribution, the Swedish Academy said, was to eliminate pure lithium from the battery, instead using only lithium ions, which are safer. He created a commercially viable lithium-ion battery for the Asahi Kasei Corp., which started selling the technology in 1991.
In 1991, Sony, recognizing the commercial potential of the emerging technology, combined Goodenough’s cathode and a carbon anode to produce the world’s first safe rechargeable lithium-ion battery for the marketplace. Applications proliferated. Labs found new ways to shrink battery sizes, yoke them together and raise energy output. A revolution in wireless mobile devices and vehicular applications exploded.
“Goodenough’s original lithium-cobalt-oxide cathode structure is still used in the lithium-ion batteries found in almost all personal electronics like smartphones and tablets,” Helen Gregg wrote in The University of Chicago Magazine in 2016. “When he was tinkering with oxides back at Oxford, Goodenough had no idea of the impact his battery would have.”
John Bannister Goodenough was born in Jena, Germany, on July 25, 1922, the second of four children of Erwin and Helen (Lewis) Goodenough. His father was finishing graduate studies at Oxford University, and the family returned to the United States when John was an infant and settled in Woodbridge, Connecticut, after his father joined the Yale faculty to teach comparative religion.
In an interview for this obituary in 2017, Goodenough said that he and his siblings, Ward, James and Hester, had “mismatched” parents who were “aloof” with their children. John also struggled with undiagnosed dyslexia and was regarded as a backward student at local primary schools. As a teenager at the Groton School in Massachusetts, he made adjustments to cope with dyslexia.
“I overcame it in a sense,” he recalled. “I was able to read mechanically. And I covered my tracks a bit by avoiding English and history, and focusing on mathematics and languages — six years of Latin and four of Greek.” Rigorous educational standards at Groton and Yale also gave structure to his life, he said.
He graduated at the top of his Groton class in 1940 and received a scholarship to Yale, where he majored in mathematics, tutored and worked other jobs to pay for his education. He had almost completed coursework for his bachelor’s degree in 1943 when he was called to active duty in the wartime Army Air Forces. He received his degree after Yale gave him credit for a military meteorology course. He served in Newfoundland and the Azores.
After the war, he received a government scholarship to study physics at the University of Chicago. He earned a master’s degree in 1951 and a doctorate a year later. After working briefly for Westinghouse, he began his career at MIT.
In 1951, he married Irene Wiseman. They had no children. She died in 2016. He is survived by a half sister, Ursula W. Goodenough, and a half brother, Daniel A. Goodenough, both of whom are emeritus biology professors.
John Goodenough held the Virginia H. Cockrell centennial chair in engineering at the University of Texas. He wrote eight books and more than 800 articles for scientific journals. His honors included the Japan Prize, the Enrico Fermi Award, the Charles Stark Draper Prize, the Welch Award in Chemistry and the National Medal of Science, which he was given by former President Barack Obama in 2011.

Egalitarian Conductor Shared Music's Spirit: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A collection of 257 CDs and eight DVDs released by Deutsche Grammophon offers the breadth of Abbado's approach, and its legacy.
Claudio Abbado lit a cigar and looked uneasy, as he often did.
The Italian conductor, who died in 2014 but would have turned 90 on June 26, was at a meal with the actor Maximilian Schell, in a scene captured in a 1996 documentary. Schell, who was typecast playing Nazis for much of his Academy Award-winning career but worked with Abbado on Schoenberg's "A Survivor From Warsaw," among other things, was telling everyone at the table that conducting must naturally give a musician a sense of power.
Abbado smiled, quizzical. Power has nothing to do with music, insisted the chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, an orchestra on which Wilhelm Furtwängler and Herbert von Karajan had once imposed their interpretive will. "For me," Abbado added, "power is always linked with dictatorship."
But not all power is political, Schell said; for instance, what might Abbado call the power of music over people? "Love, or respect, or understanding, or tolerance," the conductor replied. "Remember that, for thinking people, music is one of the most important things in life. It's part of life itself. That has nothing to do with power."
If Abbado's life had a theme, it was this question of power: of what power means in music, where it comes from, and to what ends. Few of his peers enjoyed such a vita -- before Berlin, he held posts at the Teatro Alla Scala, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Vienna State Opera -- yet were so ambivalent about authority and attention. Shy, quiet, stubborn, he took bows timidly, avoided publicity and denied that he had anything so ignoble as a career. "For me, conducting is not a game," he told The New York Times in 1973.
Politically a man of the left, Abbado as a musician was most comfortable among equals, if even that; he was a sublime accompanist to the pianists Martha Argerich and Maurizio Pollini, as well as to any number of singers. The film in which he spoke with Schell, "The Silence That Follows the Music," portrayed him as an embodiment of democracy, an exemplary figure to lead the Berlin Philharmonic after the fall of the Wall and the death of Karajan in 1989, symbols of tyranny and ego alike. If Karajan, as critics described him, saw orchestras as single entities and denied their members any individuality that might impinge on his own, Abbado increasingly saw them, over the course of his life, as more of a collective, in which the players might freely share the spirit of chamber music.
Achieving that ideal was no simple task with orchestras of long traditions and routines, though Abbado remade the Philharmonic in his image, and lastingly so. Striving to fulfill that promise led him not only to embrace the energy of youth orchestras, but also to support and found ensembles of like mind: the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, the Mahler Chamber Orchestra and the Orchestra Mozart. The most extravagant was the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, a coterie of colleagues and admirers with whom he gave critically sanctified summer performances from 2003 until just before his death. "All the musicians in the orchestra," he said in 2007, offering his highest praise to a group that included several noted soloists and sometimes entire string quartets, "they are listening to each other."
But what kinds of interpretations did Abbado's approach engender? And how will they endure?
Many certainly will last, on the evidence of a comprehensive collection of his recordings for the Deutsche Grammophon, Decca and Philips labels that the Universal Music Group released earlier this year. Complete with a hardback hagiography and a price tag that, at some retailers, has drifted into four figures despite the easy prior availability of its contents, it compiles 257 CDs and eight DVDs. The breadth is extraordinary -- what other conductor was as adept as Abbado in Rossini as well as in Webern and Ligeti? -- yet it still excludes records he made for EMI, RCA and Sony, as well as most of his vaunted Mahler from Lucerne.
Slide a sleeve out of the box, and chances are that you will select a confirmed classic -- the joyful distinction of his Schubert with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, or the formidable La Scala "Simon Boccanegra" and "Macbeth" that are the best of his Verdi. You might happen upon a less celebrated gem, like his early Stravinsky or his late Pergolesi, his "Fierrabras" or his "Khovanshchina." Far from every disc is faultless, though the worst to be said about all but the weakest of them -- his Haydn is dismayingly fussy, some of his Mozart wan -- is that they are anonymous, refined but bland. But that was the risk that Abbado took in the name of beauty.
BORN INTO A richly musical and bravely antifascist Milanese family in 1933, Abbado spent his youth watching the leading conductors of the day as they passed through La Scala. He trained as a pianist, making a couple of recordings, but his fascination was always with the magic men of the podium. Denied entry to observe rehearsals at the Musikverein in Vienna when he was a student there, from 1956 to '58, he sang his way into them instead, joining the basses of a choir that performed Bach with Hermann Scherchen, and Mahler with Josef Krips.
In 1958, Abbado triumphed at Tanglewood in the United States, then, after three years spent teaching chamber music in Parma, won a year as an assistant at the New York Philharmonic. "He is a talented conductor and one of temperament," the Times critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote after his Lincoln Center debut in 1964. If his basic approach was evident from the start -- "he seems to allow his players a freedom to enjoy themselves and yet provides an unobtrusive discipline," one reviewer noted in 1967 -- it was surely made possible by the quality of the ensembles he was quickly blessed to work with. "Now I can choose only the best orchestras," Abbado said while still not yet 40.
And how he used them. The earliest sessions in the Universal box date from February 1966, when Abbado and the London Symphony excerpted Prokofiev ballets with enjoyable flair. There are moments, in the decade or so of recordings that followed, in which his awareness of the past seems to weigh a touch too heavily -- a stolid Beethoven Seven from Vienna, a morose Brahms Three from Dresden -- but the impression on the whole is of a young conductor of rare intelligence.
All the Abbado hallmarks grace the ear, such as the immaculate balances of his crushing Tchaikovsky "Pathétique" and the poetic elegance of his first Brahms Second in Berlin, although it is striking how the incision that marks his fledgling readings of Mendelssohn's "Scottish" and "Italian" Symphonies and Berg's "Three Pieces for Orchestra" would be sanded down in equally successful later accounts. At his best, Abbado was already considerable: His Debussy, Ravel and Scriabin with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, from 1970 to '71, are not just some of the finest recordings he made, festivals of color composed with the eye of a master, but count among the choicest in the history of that orchestra.
Abbado remained acutely conscious of conducting history, symbolically wearing a watch given to him by Erich Kleiber, a fellow champion of Berg. When he appeared on the BBC radio program "Desert Island Discs" in 1980, he selected favorite recordings by Pierre Monteux, Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter and his one idol, Furtwängler, whose rare ability to generate tension he admired. But Abbado came to sound little like any of these predecessors, and took from none of them an aesthetic agenda to promote as his own. He barely spoke in detail about his artistic principles at all; "he tells you about a piece by conducting it," one of his producers said in 1994.
Given that Abbado was a slightly elusive interpreter, any generalities to be offered about him are necessarily weak. But even after he started trialing new sonorities and scales of ensemble with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe in the early 1980s -- developing an immediacy of communication that encouraged a taste for details in him that could become a little much -- there were clear traits that ran through his recordings: a warm lucidity, a smooth, long line and an ability to bring out the lyricism in a work, however dense, that critics reductively called Italianate.
With the London Symphony, there is tender, precisely shaded Ravel, a survey of cultivated Mendelssohn, exquisite Debussy, fiery Prokofiev and touching Strauss. The Chicago Symphony, too, often gave him its best, including some of his more persuasive Mahler, in whose music he was not as reliable, or at least not as distinctive, as his lifelong fidelity to the composer might suggest.
The recordings from Vienna and Berlin are more variable. Typically, the more distant a piece is from the most commonplace repertoire, the more impressive the results, though there are exceptions: chiefly, a magnificent Brahms cycle from around the start of his tenure in Berlin, audibly in the lineage of his predecessors, if gentler.
There is a gorgeous "Pelléas et Mélisande" and a sweeping "Gurrelieder" from Vienna, but there are also unusual choral works by Schubert and Schumann, endearingly done, plus unmissable Berg and Boulez. Both orchestras supply Beethoven cycles. The Vienna is patchy, the Berlin livelier but finicky, the shrunken ensemble blanched of tone. Abbado's Berlin era is better approached through other routes: a ravishing Hindemith disc; charming Mozart and Strauss with Christine Schäfer; a moving, if dimly recorded, Mahler Third along with a profoundly humane Sixth, taken from his first return to the Philharmonie since his departure in 2002, after treatment for cancer.
Illness left Abbado unable to conduct more than sporadically, mostly at Lucerne and with the Orchestra Mozart, which he founded in Bologna in 2004; experimentation decorates his late recordings with that ensemble, including with period-instrument practice, though more affectingly in his concerto collaborations with friends such as the flutist Jacques Zoon and the hornist Alessio Allegrini than in his Mozart, Schubert and Schumann symphonies.
"You never arrive in a lifetime," Abbado had told The Times in 1973. Perhaps it was apt that his last recording was of an unfinished symphony, Bruckner's Ninth, in a farewell Lucerne account that, in its final bars, seems almost to glow with compassion. He died five months later.

Where Andrew Koji Finds His Flow: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The star of the Max martial-arts drama "Warrior" starts his days with meditation and Morning Pages, and powers down with PlayStation.
In November, Andrew Koji wrapped the third season of "Warrior," the martial-arts television drama inspired by the writings of Bruce Lee. He's still recovering.
At 35, he's "just past the peak age of an athlete," he said, massaging his upper arm during a video call from London, "and I am feeling it."
In "Warrior," which begins airing June 29 on Max, Koji plays a Chinese immigrant whose search for his sister forces him into the role of hatchet man for a gang.
After he finished work on Season 2, Cinemax, which produced the first two seasons, canceled the show, the pandemic hit and his gut told him that "Snake Eyes," his 2021 G.I. Joe movie, wasn't going to be good.
"I was like, 'This is it -- my time has come, my career's over and the world is ending,"' he said. "A little bit dramatic there."
Then he landed a part in the Brad Pitt movie "Bullet Train," playing an alcoholic father intent on avenging his son's death. And "Warrior" was picked up by Max for a third season.
"I've got more options now," he said, "but I'm definitely not in that position where I'm getting great scripts sent to me. I'm still having to hustle and figure out the next move and be smart."
Koji's list of cultural essentials is more categorical than specific, like a book in his hand and a poem in his head. "I try to live my life as non-materialistically or attached to things as possible," he said. "But it did make me think, 'What are the things that I do need?"'
These are edited excerpts from our conversation.
Meditation
Meditation is the start of my day and something I always take with me. It has helped me through tough times. I believe it helps entering the state of "flow" for creativity and helps us sit through and deal with negative and challenging states of mind.
Pen and Paper
I need this wherever I go. I journal for my own sanity and use a similar practice of the "Morning Pages" from "The Artist's Way." I write ideas, thoughts, images, things I want to develop. For every character I play, I create a notebook with back stories, inner monologues, abstract ideas, and add to it over time.
Poetry From Memory
If I'm not on a job, I like to keep my brain sharp by memorizing a speech, a poem or a passage that I connect with. The last one was Rudyard Kipling's poem "If." Before that it was a passage from a Taoist book about how insignificant we are in the vastness of the cosmos, yet how we should still strive to be a better part of it.
Exercise
Training has become a big part of my life again after almost 10 years of more unhealthy and self-destructive habits during my early struggling acting years. It helps me avoid or work through negative states. Anything that can take me out of my head and into the body -- training with weights, the punching bag, Brazilian jiu-jitsu or yoga.
Teachers
If we don't keep learning throughout our lives, I think we stagnate. I'll always look to study as much as I can between work, studying with a Japanese language tutor, meditation teachers, martial-art teachers or any subject that helps inspire me creatively and think differently about something. I studied film and theater in college, and I remember my drama teacher at the time saying, "You should never become an actor." Then I found a class at the Actors' Temple, and a great teacher called Tom Radcliffe opened my eyes to maybe I could be doing this, that I had the potential to be a good actor.
Nonfiction
"Man's Search for Meaning," Bruce Lee's "Striking Thoughts," "Hardcore Zen," "The Road Less Traveled." "Easy Riders, Raging Bulls" is what I'm reading now. Older books that remind me why we do what we do on a deeper level I find helpful in this increasingly superficial modern western world.
Traveling in Japan
Kyoto is one of my favorite places -- exploring temples, disconnecting from technology, going off the beaten path. One of my favorite trails so far was the Kumano Kodo, an ancient pilgrimage route.
American and Japanese Classics
Pop and more modern music I can take or leave. But Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Frank Sinatra, Joe Hisaishi and Shigeru Umebayashi -- any music that evokes or moves my soul, rather than being light and catchy, can help inspire some creative thought.
Stand-up Comedy
Dave Chappelle, Bill Hicks, Jim Jefferies -- I used to have a habit of taking life incredibly seriously, and I need to remember to laugh and find humor in things that annoy or upset me. Stand-up comedy is such an incredible and primal craft form. I'll usually try and find a comedy show or stand-up night when I'm in a new city.
PlayStation
Last but not least, an indulgence. Watching TV and films gets my gears turning too much, but PlayStation helps me switch off my brain.

Full text: The producer and pop singer had been involved in a nearly decade-long legal saga that began with a contract disagreement.
The pop super-producer and songwriter known as Dr. Luke has dropped a defamation lawsuit against the singer Kesha, a former protégée who had accused him of rape in a 2014 lawsuit, the two parties announced in a joint statement on Thursday. The announcement signaled the end of a nearly decade-long legal saga that has riveted the music world and come to define both artists' intertwining public narratives.
The statement, posted to social media accounts belonging to both individuals, said that Kesha and Dr. Luke had "agreed to a joint resolution of the lawsuit," which was scheduled to go to trial next month in New York after years of delays.
In a pair of quotes attributed to each musician separately but presented together, Kesha said, "Only God knows what happened that night," adding: "As I have always said, I cannot recount everything that happened. I am looking forward to closing the door on this chapter in my life and beginning a new one. I wish nothing but peace to all parties involved."
Dr. Luke, born Lukasz Gottwald, added, "While I appreciate Kesha again acknowledging that she cannot recount what happened that night in 2005, I am absolutely certain that nothing happened. I never drugged or assaulted her and would never do that to anyone. For the sake of my family, I have vigorously fought to clear my name for nearly 10 years. It is time for me to put this difficult matter behind me and move on with my life. I wish Kesha well."
In a ruling earlier this month, the New York Court of Appeals reversed an earlier decision by a lower court, calling Dr. Luke a "public figure," which would have raised the bar to prove defamation at trial by requiring him to prove that Kesha had acted with actual malice. The court added that a state judge should have allowed Kesha to file counterclaims against Dr. Luke for distress and damages.
No criminal charges were ever filed in the case.
The legal back-and-forth began when Kesha claimed in a 2014 civil filing in California that she should be released from her recording contract with Dr. Luke, one of the industry's most successful behind-the-scenes figures, because the producer had "sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally abused" her since she was a teenager. The singer cited a 2005 incident not long after the pair began working together in which Kesha said she was drugged and raped by Dr. Luke after a party.
The pair worked together closely for the next decade, selling millions of albums and scoring two No. 1 hits, "Tik Tok," in 2009, and "We R Who We R," in 2010. But in her 2014 lawsuit, Kesha said that abuse from the producer, which included insults about her appearance and weight, had pushed her to the point that she "nearly lost her life." Eventually, as the #FreeKesha campaign built online, stars including Adele, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Fiona Apple, Ariana Grande and Kelly Clarkson rallied behind Kesha's cause.
"I cannot work with this monster," Kesha wrote in a 2015 affidavit, years before #MeToo became a rallying cry in the entertainment industry and beyond. "I physically cannot. I don't feel safe in any way."
Lawyers for Dr. Luke, a notoriously private figure in the industry, said throughout the legal fight that the rape and abuse accusations -- which they called "extortionist threats" by Kesha, her lawyer at the time, Mark Geragos, and her mother -- stemmed only from contentious contract negotiations that began in 2013.
Dr. Luke countersued for defamation in New York, and pointed to additional contracts that Kesha signed after the alleged 2005 rape, in addition to a sworn deposition, from 2011, in which Kesha said, "Dr. Luke never made sexual advances at me."
In a statement on Thursday, Christine Lepera, a lawyer for Dr. Luke, said the producer "has been consistent from day one that Kesha's accusations against him were completely false. Kesha's voluntary public statement clears Luke's name as it proves she had no ground to accuse him of any wrongdoing."
For years, the cases wound their way through legal systems on two coasts. And while Kesha seemed to dominate in the arena of public opinion -- culminating in an all-star performance of a survivor's anthem at the Grammy Awards in 2018 -- most of her legal claims were rejected in court or withdrawn, leaving her on the defensive in Dr. Luke's remaining defamation suit.
In 2016, a New York judge tossed Kesha's own counterclaims of infliction of emotional distress, gender-based hate crimes and employment discrimination, citing a lack of evidence and jurisdiction. (Her California suit was stayed in favor of the New York action, and later dropped.)
As the legal battle continued, Kesha said that Dr. Luke's "scorched earth litigation tactics" had halted her ability to release music on his label, Kemosabe Records, then a joint venture with Sony Music. ("Dr. Luke promised me he would stall my career if I ever stood up for myself for any reason," the singer wrote in her 2015 affidavit. "He is doing just that.")
But when her lawsuit stalled, Kesha began once again releasing albums via Dr. Luke's companies, referring obliquely but definitively to their plight on the LPs "Rainbow" (2017), "High Ground" (2020) and "Gag Order," released last month. While the albums helped grow Kesha's public persona from a wild party girl into an underdog feminist icon, they struggled commercially; "Gag Order" debuted in May at No. 187 on the Billboard 200, selling just 8,300 copies.
Dr. Luke, for a time, saw his career sink, as well. Following a string of chart-topping singles with artists like Katy Perry, Cyrus and Clarkson in the 2000s and early 2010s, the producer struggled for years to find hits amid the Kesha backlash. After working intermittently under pseudonyms, Dr. Luke has since returned to the mainstream -- while remaining very much a background figure -- finding success (and Grammy nominations) with acts like Doja Cat, Kim Petras, Nicki Minaj and Latto.
Last month, Dr. Luke was named ASCAP's pop songwriter of the year for the third time, following wins in 2010 and 2011.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: That time when Mom and Dad hired Jennifer Lawrence to introduce you to the pleasures of the opposite sex before you started college.
The premise that motors "No Hard Feelings," a new comedy directed by Gene Stupnitsky, is, if not outright indecent, at least a little crass. Via online advertisement, Laird and Allison, megawealthy Montauk residents, are seeking an attractive woman in her early 20s to deflower their socially awkward Princeton-bound son, Percy. In return for this service they'll bestow a not-quite brand-new car on the kinda-sorta prostitute.
Taking up the offer is Jennifer Lawrence's Maddie, a lifelong Montauker who's increasingly resentful of the rich folk taking over her town. She's 32 and a little too old for the gig, but she's a knockout -- as mentioned, she's played by Lawrence -- and has a canny sales pitch.
Capricious and promiscuous as she is, Maddie isn't a pro escort, but a bartender and ride-hail driver whose car has been repossessed -- and if she can't pick people up, she can't earn enough to pay the tax lien on the house she inherited from her mother. Assigned to "date date" the puppy-cute but initially highly recessive 19-year-old Percy, she goes after her prey with an aggressiveness that's initially off-putting to the lad. (He maces her at one point.)
The movie's trailer has elicited howls of outrage in some sex-unfriendly social media circles. But the movie itself handles the hook in a way that aspires to raise eyebrows, not inspire a Congressional hearing. Once Maddie is obliged to actually hang out with Percy, she starts to like him. And just as she acts on her instructions to "get him out of his shell," he persuades her to consider why she'll be dead-ending it in Montauk for the foreseeable future. If you don't see this coming, you don't know Hollywood.
The movie doesn't split the difference between raunchy sex farce and dual personal growth study so much as complacently fall between rom-com subgenres. It amiably alternates commonplace depictions of introspective intimacy with ostensibly bar-raising, outré set pieces. As when, upon being interrupted while skinny-dipping with Percy, Maddie rushes out of the ocean to deliver a buck-naked beat down to some townies trying to steal their clothes.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
One might argue that the movie doesn't really need that sort of thing, given the confidence and appeal of its lead performers. But again, Hollywood. In any event, Lawrence is a consistently incandescent screen presence, and her role lets her run through her greatest performative hits, so to speak. She's goofily sexy, poignantly wide-eyed and retains a beaming, you-can-deny-her-nothing smile. As Percy, Andrew Barth Feldman frames the character's awkwardness in a quiet register for the most part, but in more expansive nerd moments recalls a young Martin Short. Matthew Broderick and Laura Benanti are present and correct as the peculiar parents. But Natalie Morales, Scott MacArthur and Zahn McClarnon as Maddie's townie pals, who provide sardonic working class solidarity for our heroine, have some of the picture's choicest bits.
No Hard Feelings
Rated R for language, themes, sexuality, a buck-naked beat down. Running time: 1 hour 43 minutes. In theaters.

Microsoft Could Abandon Its Deal With Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A five-day hearing over Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition, which the Federal Trade Commission hopes to block, began Thursday in federal court.
The first day of a weeklong hearing that could determine the outcome of Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game giant Activision Blizzard opened Thursday with a promise from Microsoft: If a federal judge grants an injunction that would delay the deal's closing, Microsoft could abandon the deal altogether.
"This is going to decide whether the deal goes forward," said Beth Wilkinson, Microsoft's lead lawyer. She added that a loss could force the company into a "three-year administrative nightmare" that would sink the transaction, which it hopes to close by July 18.
That set the stakes for the hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where the Federal Trade Commission began laying out its case that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision -- and its popular games like Call of Duty -- would be devastating for the video game industry.
The F.T.C. is asking Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley for a preliminary injunction, which would bar Microsoft from completing the deal before the F.T.C. had the chance to argue the case in its internal court.
The clash is broadly seen as a test of whether recent efforts to more aggressively curb the power of tech giants around the world will succeed. Lina Khan, the chair of the F.T.C., has argued that big tech companies have vast influence over online commerce and communication, allowing them to engage in anticompetitive practices that harm consumers.
"If this deal is completed, the combined company will have and is likely to have the ability and incentive to harm competition in various markets related to consoles, subscription services and cloud," James Weingarten, the F.T.C.'s lead lawyer, said in court on Thursday.
Mr. Weingarten said Microsoft could make Activision's games exclusive to its Xbox console, or degrade their quality on other platforms to make the Xbox more appealing to gamers. He pointed to Microsoft's $ 7.5 billion purchase of ZeniMax Media and its slate of game studios in 2020, after which Microsoft made some of those games exclusive to Xbox. The F.T.C. pointed to an agreement made between Disney and ZeniMax to produce a game about Indiana Jones for multiple consoles. After Microsoft bought ZeniMax, the agreement was amended and the game became exclusive to Xbox. It was an indication, the F.T.C. appeared to be arguing, that Microsoft could make future Activision games exclusive to Xbox, even amending existing deals to do so.
The F.T.C. has argued that absorbing Activision's games into Microsoft's portfolio would also give it an unfair edge in the nascent market for cloud gaming.
Sony, which makes the rival PlayStation console, has been a vocal critic of the deal, and has said that PlayStation gamers could lose access to Call of Duty -- an enormous franchise that has earned more than $ 30 billion in lifetime revenue -- if Microsoft decided to make the game exclusive to Xbox. Microsoft has denied that it would do so.
Microsoft said the Activision deal would instead be good for consumers, expanding their ability to play Activision's games through low-cost options like Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service, or through the platforms of other companies like Nintendo and Nvidia, with which it has struck deals.
Ms. Wilkinson also argued that it would be nonsensical for Microsoft to remove Call of Duty and other titles from PlayStation because the company would lose out on a huge chunk of the game's revenue. She said Sony had become the "complainer in chief" in the case, and showed an email from Sony's chief executive, Jim Ryan, suggesting that he did not really believe Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty. Microsoft also pointed to its acquisition of Mojang, which produces Minecraft. It has continued to allow Minecraft to be available across platforms.
The F.T.C. has in another lawsuit accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of cutting off nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. On Wednesday, it sued Amazon over allegations that the company tricked users into signing up for its Prime subscription service. But the F.T.C. has had setbacks: Its challenge to Meta's purchase of a virtual reality start-up fell apart this year after a judge declined to stop the deal from closing.
The F.T.C. initially challenged Microsoft's bid for Activision using an in-house court. But that court does not have the legal authority to stop the deal. The F.T.C. asked the federal court to step in this month, saying it feared Microsoft would try to complete the deal despite the legal challenges.
The hearing in Judge Corley's courtroom could be a decisive test for the F.T.C. If Microsoft wins, it will signal that there are weaknesses in the F.T.C. case and could cause the agency to drop its challenge to the deal. But a win for the F.T.C. would be a sign that its broader challenge has legs, and could put new pressure on Microsoft and Activision to reconsider the multibillion-dollar corporate marriage.
Though most governments around the world, including the European Union, have approved the acquisition, Microsoft was dealt a setback in April when a British regulatory authority blocked it. That decision is under appeal.
The high-profile list of witnesses expected to testify before Judge Corley over the next week includes Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, and Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision. Mr. Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, will appear via a prerecorded video deposition.

Poor Opening for 'Elemental' Raises Doubts About Pixar on the Big Screen: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The original animated film took in $ 29.5 million at the box office, by far the worst opening in Pixar's three-decade history. "The Flash," from Warner Bros., also struggled.
Pixar is damaged as a big-screen brand.
That was one of the rather glum takeaways from the weekend box office, which found "Elemental," a $ 200 million-plus Pixar original, arriving to a disastrous $ 29.5 million in domestic ticket sales. "The Flash," a Warner Bros. superhero spectacle that cost about $ 200 million, also struggled, taking in a lethargic $ 55.1 million, according to Comscore, which compiles ticketing data.
"Hard to sugarcoat this," said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers.
Questions about Pixar's health have swirled in Hollywood and among investors since last June, when the Disney-owned studio released "Lightyear" to disastrous results. How could Pixar, the gold standard of animation studios for nearly three decades, have gotten a movie so wrong -- especially one about Buzz Lightyear, a bedrock "Toy Story" character?
Maybe pandemic-worried families were not quite ready to return to theaters. Or maybe, as some box office analysts speculated, Disney had weakened the Pixar brand by using its films to build the Disney+ streaming service. Starting in late 2020, Disney debuted three Pixar films in a row ("Soul," "Turning Red" and "Luca") online, bypassing theaters altogether.
By streaming standards, those three movies were runaway hits. But Pixar's most recent box office success was in 2019, when "Toy Story 4" took in $ 1.1 billion worldwide.
Attendance for "Elemental" over the weekend reinforced the brand problem hypothesis: It was Pixar's worst opening-weekend result ever in the United States and Canada. The previous bottom was "Onward," which arrived to $ 39 million ( $ 46 million after adjusting for inflation) in domestic ticket sales in March 2020, just as the coronavirus pandemic started to sweep the globe.
"Elemental," a cross-cultural girl-meets-boy romantic comedy, took in an additional $ 15 million in limited release overseas, Disney said.
To re-establish Pixar movies as more than just Disney+ food, the company held a premiere for "Elemental" at the Cannes Film Festival as well as in Los Angeles at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. "We've trained audiences that these films will be available for you on Disney+," Pete Docter, Pixar's chief creative officer, said on Friday in an interview with Variety, a trade news outlet. "We're trying to make sure people realize there's a great deal you're missing by not seeing it on the big screen."
Films based on original stories are becoming harder sells, especially at a time when going to the movies has become more expensive and the broader economy is unsettled. People want to know that spending the money will be worth it. The animated movies that have been succeeding have been based on established characters and franchises.
"If you don't swing for original stories you can't make new franchises, and we swung really hard," said Tony Chambers, Disney's executive vice president of theatrical distribution. Referring to intellectual property, he added, "Original I.P. needs to work a lot harder to break through nowadays."
Families turned out in colossal numbers for "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" (Universal) in April and "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" (Sony) early this month. Family moviegoing budgets may be used up at this point, and movie watchers know they will be able to catch "Elemental" before long at home.
Some people in Hollywood and on Wall Street also worry that Pixar's once-dazzling creative spark has started to flicker. The studio has suffered brain drain; it eliminated 75 jobs last month as part of Disney-wide layoffs and cost cuts. (The "Lightyear" director Angus MacLane, a 26-year Pixar veteran, was among those who received a pink slip.) Pixar has also been pushed to expand into television production to keep the Disney+ shelves stocked. "The higher the volume, the lower the quality," said Terry Press, a former Disney, DreamWorks and CBS Films executive.
Reviews for "Elemental" were mostly positive, although to a lesser degree than normal for a Pixar release. Ticket buyers gave it an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls. The "audience score" on Rotten Tomatoes stood at a sky-high 91 percent on Sunday morning.
In a statement, Disney said that the positive reviews "set us up for a strong theatrical run through the school holiday period." The next major animated film for families is "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem" (Paramount), which does not arrive in theaters until Aug. 2.
"The Flash" (Warner Bros.) received weaker reviews and a chillier audience response -- ticket buyers gave it a B in CinemaScore exit polls -- but filled enough seats to rank as the No. 1 movie in the United States and Canada. The movie finds the titular superhero using his powers to travel back in time, accidentally causing mayhem. Batman and Supergirl also figure prominently.
In part, "The Flash" suffered from timing: It was delayed by the pandemic, finally arriving at a moment when late night shows -- crucial movie marketing platforms -- are shut down because of a strike by show writers. Warner Bros. and its DC Studios division have also cited superhero fatigue as an explanation for the recent underperformance of a string of their comics-based movies, including "Shazam! Fury of the Gods" and "Black Adam."
Ezra Miller, who played the Flash, became a divisive figure after a spate of offscreen legal troubles and erratic behavior in 2021 and 2022. (The actor, who is nonbinary, issued an apology last year and said they were seeking mental health treatment. They largely did not do publicity for "The Flash.")
"The superhero world is fantasy, escapist fun," Mr. Gross said. "Everybody has to play along. This didn't help."

Battle Rap Soldiers: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The Fierce, Flourishing World of Battle Rap
On the eastern edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant -- a Brooklyn neighborhood synonymous with hip-hop excellence -- a tiny wellness center is tucked between a Pentecostal church and a real estate office. Inside its sterile, 800 or so square feet, there's a wall of mirrors, stock photos of people performing various exercises and fluorescent lighting that makes the plastic plants in the corner look even more fake. On certain nights, one could be excused for thinking this is a waiting room and not what it actually is: a battleground.
Here, in this unassuming room, the Trap NY -- one of several battle rap leagues based in New York City -- hosts most of its events. If your only exposure to these face-offs is the climactic scene of "8 Mile," this venue might seem underwhelming at first; it's certainly less colorful than the steampunk underground arena where Eminem triumphed over Anthony Mackie.
But those tapped into today's vibrant and multilayered battle rap ecosystem know that this modest gym is far more than a setting where wannabe rappers roast each other. Founded by Tyrell Reid, known as No Mercy, the Trap NY is a well-known institution where future stars of this culture are born.
"This is one of those places where you can make a statement with the right type of performance," said Hero, 29, a rapper from Dallas. "It's a place where you've got to prove you're one of them guys that matter in battle rap."
Battle rap is an art form and a sport, as well as an industry that has been slowly growing over the last decade. Leagues like the Ultimate Rap League (URL), King of the Dot and Rare Breed Entertainment have amassed large and devoted followings by presenting national events with some of the best battlers in the world. These organizations now pay top dollar to M.C.s who can keep their fans engaged -- and prove themselves against the competition.
Today, hundreds of aspiring rappers are after the money and respect that come with being a top-tier battle rapper. For many, that journey starts in spots like the Trap NY. Hero is one of a host of rappers who fly halfway across the country just to rap at the wellness center. Almost none of them get paid. They come to the Trap because they know one good performance there can mean a chance to become a part of battle rap's next generation of elites.
These battles often have a simple structure: three rounds in which two M.C.s try to out-rap each other with a cappella verses crafted specifically for their opponent. In the end, there's usually no official victor. Half the fun for many viewers -- both in person and online -- is debating who won.
Competitions like these are one of the most foundational and time-honored traditions in hip-hop, a culture celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. While battle rap operates outside the machine of the hip-hop industry, organizations like the Ultimate Rap League are dedicated to bringing it to a wider audience. Founded in 2009, URL has accrued hundreds of millions of streams and sold out venues of 1,000-plus seats with its thrillingly produced events. Between ticket sales, ad revenue, pay-per-view broadcasts and app subscriptions, outfits like URL have taken the street art of battle rap and turned it into a legitimate business.
"This was a sport that didn't really have the recognition nor the respect from hip-hop culture to the point where these M.C.s could get paid," said Troy Mitchell, known as Smack, one of the founders and owners of URL. "Once we brought it from the streets and took it to venues, we started to create a business out of it, a business where we could actually pay M.C.s to do something that they love to do."
The immense lyrical talent on URL's roster has been key to its success. Unlike recording artists, battlers don't have to worry about musical trends or chart data; hiring producers or booking studio time; TikTok virality or playlist placement. This frees them up to focus on intricate wordplay and detailed storytelling.
However, it also means that if their pen isn't mighty enough to impress the excitable, often ruthless audience, there's not much else they can do to win them over. With a crowded field of highly skilled M.C.s, this sport has achieved a standard of lyricism that many feel is missing from mainstream hip-hop today. As DNA, a well-known 31-year-old battler from Queens put it, "I can name on one hand how many people I think are as lyrically inclined as a battle rapper."
This perhaps explains why big names in hip-hop are increasingly taking note. Drake has hosted and sponsored several URL events, and said at one of them that these rappers are "people that I'm obviously extremely inspired by, that motivate me when I'm writing." URL's "Homecoming" event, which sold out Irving Plaza in Manhattan this past November, attracted New York royalty including Busta Rhymes, Fabolous and Ghostface Killah as spectators. Remy Ma even started a battle rap league of her own, Chrome 23, with the goal of providing more opportunities for women in battle rap. The organization sold out New York's Sony Hall in February with an event that included the finals of a $ 25,000 all-female tournament, a milestone in this male-dominated sport.
"There's such a huge pay gap when it comes to men and women in battle rap," Remy Ma -- who got her start in these kinds of competitions -- said in an interview, "and I feel like somebody who knows battle rap really needed to step in and give them a chance to even out the playing field." (The $ 25,000 prize went to C3, a Queens native.)
AS THE AUDIENCE and respect for battle rap has grown, so has the money. Today, URL pays its biggest stars up to six figures, and many rappers now feel their talent is better compensated and more appreciated in battle rap than it would be in the recording industry.
According to DNA, a lot of the people in the recording business "have all the popularity in the world but then the deals that they have are terrible. Top battle rappers, we make more than a lot of recording artists get and we have the creative freedom of independent contractors."
But in order to earn a spot in a league like URL, rappers must first cut their teeth in smaller, more humble arenas. And while battle rap has proving grounds all over the country, New York is its epicenter. Aspiring talent flocks to the city, hoping to get noticed via local leagues like the Trap NY, iBattle or WeGoHardTV. Their battles take place in rented-out gyms, galleries and clubhouses where audiences as small as a dozen crowd around unpaid talent in cramped semicircles.
What they lack in size or flash, though, they make up for in import. The people who run them are well-respected and highly connected in the world of battle rap, and bigger organizations like URL often look to them to scout their next stars. Today, many of battle rap's biggest talents -- like the hardened yet deeply human Eazy‌ the Block Captain or the Indian American rapper Real Sikh, known for his dizzying flow and wordplay -- were groomed and discovered in places like the Trap NY.
"A lot of people sleep on the battles that happen here," said Chris Dubbs, a 20-year-old rapper from New Jersey and one of ‌the Trap's rising stars, "but naw, man, this is where you're seeing the stars of tomorrow."
Since founding the Trap NY in 2013, No Mercy, 35, hasn't turned much of a profit. In fact, he usually loses money on his events. But for him, the point isn't to create a successful business, it's to nurture promising new M.C.s and give them tools to succeed. While rappers on the Trap may not find immediate fame or fortune, they will gain a mentor who can take their battle rap career to the next level if they're willing to work hard and listen to feedback.
"We don't want to sell people on the idea that if you do one battle over here, you're going to be this huge star overnight," No Mercy said. "No, expect that, for at least a year, you're going to be grinding with us in order to elevate. Look at where you are now and see where you are within the next year; see if there hasn't been a change."
However, Alex Braga -- known as Lexx Luthor, a Staten Island-based battle rapper and owner of iBattle -- argues that institutions like his are far more than just a steppingstone. As URL gains more of a national profile, he believes small franchises are crucial for maintaining a sense of community and highlighting talent that may not be as traditionally marketable. (While the majority of URL's stars are straight Black men, iBattle regularly hosts rappers of all races, religions, sexual orientations and genders. A recent battle featured a white Christian rapper facing off against a bisexual Jew.)
Lexx became a league owner about six years ago. His career as a battler was just beginning to take off when iBattle, a league he grew up performing in, started to decline. It was then that he realized how important places like these were to him.
"It just felt like the longer I stayed a battle rapper, the less and less there was of a community," Lexx said. "So when iBattle went defunct and the original league owner couldn't run it anymore because of health issues, I knew I couldn't let it die."
IT MAY BE confusing to hear battle rap called a community when events often involve rappers spraying insults, death threats and literal spit in their opponents' faces. During one of the Trap's events, Chris Dubbs rapped to Xcel, "Your death all over social media once I blast mags/Soon as I click that bro, It's tic-tac-toe: y'all gonna see X on a hashtag."
But look beneath the violent tenor of these battles and you'll notice signs of deep camaraderie. Rappers will often nod in approval or even give a pat on the back when their competition lands a particularly good punchline; if someone starts forgetting what they wrote, their opponent might mutter words of encouragement; and when it's all over, the rappers will, almost without fail, exchange congratulatory daps and embraces.
"It's like boxing," explained Cheeko, one of the owners of URL. "Boxers, they appreciate each other's skill sets, they root for each other. You rarely see M.C.s that have a disdain for each other. It's almost like a brotherhood."
This mutual respect plays a big role in battle rap's appeal. To many M.C.s, this culture offers a necessary but all-too-rare opportunity to express themselves in a way that is productive and safe.
"Battle rap is the only place where you can have two people get their frustration out, say what they don't like about each other and then at the end of it shake hands," said Xcel, 37, who got his start on the Trap and has since performed on battle rap's biggest platforms. "It's the only place in the world where a Crip can battle a Blood and nobody dies."
There are many unifying forces in the battle rap community, but perhaps the strongest is a deep belief in the art form itself. As hip-hop continues to be a dominating force in popular culture, some in this world say battle rap could make a leap into the mainstream.
"Within the next 10 years, I guarantee you battle rappers are going to be household names the same way industry artists are household names," said Dubbs, who is vying to become one of URL's next big stars. "People are finally starting to take notice and it's a beautiful thing. Get into it now so you can appreciate it while it's still in its beginning stages."

Under Scrutiny, An R-Rated Genre Shifts on the Fly: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This summer, raunchy comedies with a feminist perspective are trying to reinvent an R-rated genre that often can't withstand much scrutiny.
Critics and audiences have long despaired: Where have all the romantic comedies gone? The freewheeling effervescence of bygone Harrys and Sallys and Bridget Joneses; the bright aspirational gloss of a Nancy Meyers production (her latest was dropped by Netflix in March when its price tag reportedly sailed past the $ 130 million mark).
Instead, what modern viewers mostly get are pale, labored imitations -- the frenetic Jennifer Lopez-Josh Duhamel caper "Shotgun Wedding," the hollow-core Ana de Armas-Chris Evans vehicle "Ghosted." In projects like these, romance is an empty gesture; chemistry, a distant dream. ("Your Place or Mine," a dry kiss of long-distance courtship released earlier this year, literally couldn't stand to keep Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher in the same frame physically for more than three scenes.)
Moviegoers starved for something unabashedly adult and, the film gods willing, actually fun, will probably have better luck finding it this summer in the revival of another languishing genre: the rom-com's hornier cousin, the sex comedy. Though what hard-R shenanigans look like in 2023 -- post-#MeToo, post-pandemic, mid-online culture wars -- may necessarily be a very different thing than in 1993, or even 2013.
In a landscape so dominated by bloated blockbusters and soul-deadening sequels, it's slightly depressing to acknowledge that fresh perspective can be signaled by something as simple, and as radical, as letting the lens be female. Still, there's novelty in seeing the Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence sign on to a libidinous goof like "No Hard Feelings," due June 23. She stars as a financially strapped Uber driver who agrees, for a fee, to seduce the awkward teenage son of a wealthy New York couple. The red-band trailer surpassed 45 million views in its first 24 hours online -- a testament, perhaps, to moviegoers' too-long-untapped appetite for cheerfully slapstick set pieces and "Can I touch your wiener?" jokes.
The similarly debauched "Joy Ride," a sort of sunny "Hangover" redux starring and created by Asian American women, earned near-universal raves when it premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March. (It's scheduled for wide release July 7.) Over 95 flamboyantly unhinged minutes, Ashley Park of "Emily in Paris" and the "Everything Everywhere All at Once" star Stephanie Hsu lead a loose foursome to China on a journey of friendship and self-discovery, breaking several dozen statutes for class-A drugs and public indecency along the way.
Introduced that same week at SXSW, the scrappy lower-budget "Bottoms" (in theaters Aug. 25) was hailed as a queer Gen-Z twist on the classic high school virginity tale. Directed by Emma Seligman ("Shiva Baby"), the movie features "Shiva" star Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri from "The Bear" as teenage lesbians who start a fight club to woo the cheerleaders of their dreams. Hickeys and hematomas ensue.
The sex they're all putting onscreen is screwball and messy and sometimes medically unsound. It also unapologetically centers female desire and pleasure of all kinks and stripes -- "I'll have what she's having" to the nth degree. If these films succeed, they'll join a short list of equal-opportunity raunch at the multiplex: Women-behaving-badly touchstones like 2011's scatological lodestar "Bridesmaids," the 2015 Amy Schumer hit "Trainwreck," and the raucous 2017 ensemble "Girls Trip," which turned Tiffany Haddish into a grapefruit-fellating meme overnight. (Think of "Easy A" (2010), starring a scarlet-lettered Emma Stone, as the PG-13 starter kit.) Those all had male and often middle-aged directors, though; far less common still are ones actually overseen by women, like Kay Cannon's "Blockers" and Olivia Wilde's "Booksmart."
So some of the demographic shifts here seem worth singling out: "Joy Ride" is the directing debut of the Malaysian American screenwriter Adele Lim, who co-wrote "Crazy Rich Asians," and the screenplay is by "Family Guy" alumnae Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and Teresa Hsiao. Most of the players on both sides of the camera in "Bottoms" -- which toggles breezily between references to bell hooks and mid-aughts Avril Lavigne -- were born after the Clinton administration.
But audiences, of course, hardly measure their leisure time in diversity bona fides. Battered by Covid, spooked by a teetering economy, and finally cooling, perhaps, on endless Marvel tentpoles, their one directive seems to be: Entertain me. Given the option of heady but esoteric award bait like "Tár" and "Women Talking," in which, respectively, a classical-music conductor spirals into self-imposed ignominy and Mennonite women debate rape in a barn, they've flocked instead to blithely ludicrous undercards like "M3gan" and "Cocaine Bear." (The latter shares two of its three producers with "Bottoms.")
Even wiener jokes, though, are freighted with the weight of history. Seth Rogen, whose career took root in the animal house that Judd Apatow built and who is credited as a producer on "Joy Ride," has acknowledged in numerous interviews that much of his catalog doesn't hold up to scrutiny today. A cursory rewatch of canon classics like "Porky's," "American Pie" and most films in the Apatow extended universe ("Knocked Up," "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," "Superbad") calls back moments of winky misogyny, casual racism and not-so-latent homophobia that seem like obvious third rails now.
How Hollywood can adapt in an era so strenuously aware of identity and isms -- and a generation of young people reportedly having significantly less sex than their predecessors -- feels like a continuing social experiment, as murky as the future of movies themselves. The gift of the most outrageous comedies, after all, is that they allow us, for an hour or two in a darkened room, to leave best behavior and safe spaces at the door. At a press preview in April, the co-stars Sydney Sweeney and Glenn Powell proudly sold their forthcoming "Anyone but You," a modern riff on Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing" due in December from the "Easy A" director Will Gluck, as a combative romance between "a real nightmare" and an ass, with no small amount of nudity. The internet swooned.
Those who fit a certain archetype, though, like Powell and Sweeney, will naturally be given more latitude than others to nudge the boundaries of mainstream taste. Projects that showcase more traditionally underrepresented groups -- or anyone, really, who falls within the confines of not straight, not skinny, not white -- are still often made to carry the full weight of representation. See the performative hand-wringing over the box office failure last year of "Bros," a well-reviewed gay rom-com with an R rating and an out cast, after it was breathlessly touted as the first film of its kind to receive wide theatrical release.
Maybe for all those reasons, there are no teachable moments explicitly embedded in the delirious, rampaging teendom of "Bottoms," even as certain life lessons sneak in sideways from the margins. Or in "Joy Ride," which nevertheless features one major character in search of her Chinese birth parents, another who is nonbinary, and two more who treat sex like a kind of globe-trotting all-you-can-eat buffet. Here, the medium is the message; the rest is as nasty -- and ultimately chaotic, tenderhearted, and yes, joyful -- as it wants to be.

The Fierce, Flourishing World of Battle Rap

NEW YORK — On the eastern edge of Bedford-Stuyvesant — a Brooklyn neighborhood synonymous with hip-hop excellence — a tiny wellness center is tucked between a Pentecostal church and a real estate office. Inside its sterile, 800 or so square feet, there’s a wall of mirrors, stock photos of people performing various exercises and fluorescent lighting that makes the plastic plants in the corner look even more fake. On certain nights, one could be excused for thinking this is a waiting room and not what it actually is: a battleground.
Here, in this unassuming room, the Trap NY — one of several battle rap leagues based in New York City — hosts most of its events. If your only exposure to these face-offs is the climactic scene of “8 Mile,” this venue might seem underwhelming at first; it’s certainly less colorful than the steampunk underground arena where Eminem triumphed over Anthony Mackie.
But those tapped into today’s vibrant and multilayered battle rap ecosystem know that this modest gym is far more than a setting where wannabe rappers roast each other. Founded by Tyrell Reid, known as No Mercy, the Trap NY is a well-known institution where future stars of this culture are born.
“This is one of those places where you can make a statement with the right type of performance,” said Hero, 29, a rapper from Dallas. “It’s a place where you’ve got to prove you’re one of them guys that matter in battle rap.”
Battle rap is an art form and a sport, as well as an industry that has been slowly growing over the last decade. Leagues like the Ultimate Rap League (URL), King of the Dot and Rare Breed Entertainment have amassed large and devoted followings by presenting national events with some of the best battlers in the world. These organizations now pay top dollar to MCs who can keep their fans engaged — and prove themselves against the competition.
Today, hundreds of aspiring rappers are after the money and respect that come with being a top-tier battle rapper. For many, that journey starts in spots like the Trap NY. Hero is one of a host of rappers who fly halfway across the country just to rap at the wellness center. Almost none of them get paid. They come to the Trap because they know one good performance there can mean a chance to become a part of battle rap’s next generation of elites.
These battles often have a simple structure: three rounds in which two MCs try to out-rap each other with a cappella verses crafted specifically for their opponent. In the end, there’s usually no official victor. Half the fun for many viewers — both in person and online — is debating who won.
Competitions like these are one of the most foundational and time-honored traditions in hip-hop, a culture celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. While battle rap operates outside the machine of the hip-hop industry, organizations like the Ultimate Rap League are dedicated to bringing it to a wider audience. Founded in 2009, URL has accrued hundreds of millions of streams and sold out venues of 1,000-plus seats with its thrillingly produced events. Between ticket sales, ad revenue, pay-per-view broadcasts and app subscriptions, outfits like URL have taken the street art of battle rap and turned it into a legitimate business.
“This was a sport that didn’t really have the recognition nor the respect from hip-hop culture to the point where these MCs could get paid,” said Troy Mitchell, known as Smack, one of the founders and owners of URL. “Once we brought it from the streets and took it to venues, we started to create a business out of it, a business where we could actually pay MCs to do something that they love to do.”
The immense lyrical talent on URL’s roster has been key to its success. Unlike recording artists, battlers don’t have to worry about musical trends or chart data; hiring producers or booking studio time; TikTok virality or playlist placement. This frees them up to focus on intricate wordplay and detailed storytelling.
However, it also means that if their pen isn’t mighty enough to impress the excitable, often ruthless audience, there’s not much else they can do to win them over. With a crowded field of highly skilled MCs, this sport has achieved a standard of lyricism that many feel is missing from mainstream hip-hop today. As DNA, a well-known 31-year-old battler from Queens, put it, “I can name on one hand how many people I think are as lyrically inclined as a battle rapper.”
This perhaps explains why big names in hip-hop are increasingly taking note. Drake has hosted and sponsored several URL events, and said at one of them that these rappers are “people that I’m obviously extremely inspired by, that motivate me when I’m writing.” URL’s “Homecoming” event, which sold out Irving Plaza in Manhattan this past November, attracted New York royalty including Busta Rhymes, Fabolous and Ghostface Killah as spectators. Remy Ma even started a battle rap league of her own, Chrome 23, with the goal of providing more opportunities for women in battle rap. The organization sold out New York’s Sony Hall in February with an event that included the finals of a $25,000 all-female tournament, a milestone in this male-dominated sport.

Full text: At Simon & Schuster, Alfred A. Knopf and The New Yorker, he polished the work of a who's who of mid-to-late 20th century writers.
Robert Gottlieb, an illustrious editor at Simon & Schuster, Alfred A. Knopf and The New Yorker whose deft touch shaped a bibliophile's library of novels, nonfiction books and magazine articles by a pantheon of acclaimed writers from the middle to the late 20th century, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 92.
The death, at a hospital, was confirmed by his wife, Maria Tucci.
Mr. Gottlieb edited novels by, among many others, John le Carré, Toni Morrison, John Cheever, Joseph Heller, Doris Lessing and Chaim Potok; science fiction by Michael Crichton and Ray Bradbury; histories by Antonia Fraser and Barbara Tuchman; memoirs by former President Bill Clinton and Katharine Graham, the former publisher of The Washington Post; and works by Jessica Mitford and Anthony Burgess.
For three decades at the publishing houses Simon & Schuster and Knopf, he turned hundreds of manuscripts into well-received books, many of which sold millions of copies, won awards and made authors wealthy and famous. Colleagues called him incisive but sensitive to writers' eggshell egos. His skills won him a loyal following of authors, and he became Knopf's president as well as editor in chief.
Then, in 1987, in an abrupt career change from the relative anonymity and serenity of book publishing, Mr. Gottlieb was named the third editor in the 62-year history of The New Yorker, one of American journalism's highest-profile jobs. He replaced William Shawn, the magazine's legendary editor for 35 years, who had succeeded the founding editor, Harold Ross.
The appointment by S.I. Newhouse Jr., whose family owned both Knopf's parent company, Random House, and The New Yorker, hit the staff like a bomb. A petition by 154 writers, editors and others protested the forced retirement of Mr. Shawn, who had made journalism history with breakthrough articles that became best-selling books: John Hersey's "Hiroshima," on the first atomic bombing of a city; Hannah Arendt's "Eichmann in Jerusalem"; Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring."
The petition noted Mr. Gottlieb's reputation for brilliance but nonetheless urged him to withdraw, saying that an insider like Charles McGrath, the magazine's fiction editor and heir apparent, could best serve its traditions. (Mr. McGrath later became editor of The New York Times Book Review and a writer at large for The Times.) But Mr. Gottlieb refused to step aside and plunged into the topsy-turvy world of weekly deadlines and strange editor-writer relationships that reversed his long experience in book publishing.
"In a publishing house, you are in a strictly service job as an editor," he recalled in "The Art of Making Magazines," a 2012 anthology. "Your job is to serve the book and the writer." It was different at The New Yorker, he said: "You are the living god. You are not there to please the writers, but the writers are there to satisfy you because they want to be in the magazine."
Unlike his revered and formal predecessor, who wore jackets and ties, saw people by appointment and was addressed as "Mr. Shawn," Mr. Gottlieb was a quirky collector of kitsch, like plastic women's handbags, a passionate lover of classical ballet and an eccentric Anglophile who called writers "dear boy."
He did not attend gossipy magazine lunches, preferring a hot dog in Central Park or a sandwich at his desk. With his long face, heavy glasses and thinning hair, he padded around the office like a beachcomber in old sneakers, baggy pants and rumpled polo shirts, schmoozing with the staff.
Easing the apprehensions of many New Yorker aficionados, he made few and mostly minor changes over five years. He published new contributors, including the journalist Raymond Bonner, the essayist Judith Thurman and the poet Diane Ackerman, and fiction by Robert Stone and Richard Ford. New critics were hired, and Talk of the Town pieces were opened to more writers. But he did not shorten the long articles that critics sometimes called long-winded and boring, and he gradually won the trust and affection of most of the staff.
In 1992, Tina Brown, the British editor of Vanity Fair, replaced Mr. Gottlieb in an amicable transition and introduced splashy changes. Admirers called them lively topicality and refreshing impertinence. Traditionalists called them vulgar, particularly a portrait of Eustace Tilley, the magazine's trademark dandy, who appeared on an anniversary cover as an acne-plagued teenager with a gold earring, squinting at a handbill for a Times Square sex shop.
After his New Yorker days, Mr. Gottlieb in time resumed editing for Knopf; became a dance critic for The New York Observer; compiled anthologies on dance, jazz and lyrics; and wrote several books, including a 2016 memoir, "Avid Reader: A Life," in which he addressed the pros and cons of the literary life.
"There are editors who will always feel guilty that they aren't writers," he explained. "I can write perfectly well -- anybody who's educated can write perfectly well. It's very, very hard, and I just don't like the activity. Whereas reading is like breathing."
His memoir offered a highlight reel of snarky critiques of authors -- the Nobel laureate V.S. Naipaul ("a snob"), Ms. Tuchman ("her sense of entitlement was sometimes hard to deal with"), William Gaddis ("unrelentingly disgruntled"), Roald Dahl ("erratic and churlish").
"He wasn't just an editor, he was the editor," Mr. le Carré told The Times. "I never had an editor to touch him, in any country -- nobody who could compare with him." He noted that Mr. Gottlieb, using No. 2 pencils to mark up manuscripts, often signaled changes with hieroglyphics in the margins: a wavy line for language too florid, ellipses or question marks advising a writer to "think harder and try again."
Robert Adams Gottlieb was born in Manhattan on April 29, 1931, the only child of Charles and Martha (Keen) Gottlieb. His father was a lawyer, his mother a teacher. He grew up on the Upper West Side and attended the Birch Wathen School.
A sickly, lonely, unhappy child, he sought refuge in books, which he sped through. As a teenager, he said, he read Tolstoy's "War and Peace" in a day and Marcel Proust's monumental "Remembrance of Things Past" in a week.
"I would read three to four books a day after school, and could read for 16 hours at a time," he told The Times in 1980. "Mind you, that's all I did. I belonged to three lending libraries and the public library."
At Columbia University, he breezed through literature studies and earned a bachelor's degree, with a Phi Beta Kappa key, in 1952. He received a postgraduate degree from the University of Cambridge in England in 1954.
In 1952, Mr. Gottlieb married Muriel Higgins. They had a son, Roger, before divorcing. He married Ms. Tucci, an actress, in 1969. They had two children, Lizzie and Nicky.
In addition to Ms. Tucci, he is survived by his children and twin grandsons.
Mr. Gottlieb joined Simon & Schuster in 1955 as assistant to the editor, Jack Goodman. After his boss died in 1957, he became a senior editor, handling books by the drama critic Walter Kerr and the humorist S.J. Perelman as well as novels and works of nonfiction. He became editor in chief in 1965.
He was dazzled by a manuscript entitled "Catch-18," by an advertising copywriter named Joseph Heller. The title was changed because Leon Uris was working on the novel "Mila 18," and in 1961, Mr. Heller's book was published as "Catch-22."
A serio-comic antiwar novel, "Catch-22" became a durable best seller, memorable for its portrayal of a "catch" for World War II airmen, which became part of the American lexicon: They did not have to fly any more missions if they were crazy, but seeking exemption showed a rational concern for safety and was proof of sanity, requiring more missions.
Mr. Gottlieb joined Knopf in 1968 as vice president and editor in chief. He edited Robert Caro's Pulitzer-Prize winning biography of Robert Moses, "The Power Broker" (1974), cutting 400,000 words from a million-word manuscript with the author fuming at his elbow. Despite the brutal cuts, their collaboration endured for five decades and became the subject of a 2022 documentary, "Turn Every Page," directed by Lizzie Gottlieb, Mr. Gottlieb's daughter.
"I have never encountered a publisher or editor with a greater understanding of what a writer was trying to do -- and how to help him do it," Mr. Caro said in a statement on Mr. Gottlieb's death.
Flashing his range, Mr. Gottlieb also edited "Miss Piggy's Guide to Life" (1981), by Henry Beard, ghosting for the Muppets starlet, and Salman Rushdie's "Midnight's Children" and "Shame."
Mr. Gottlieb became president of Knopf in 1973.
He had homes in Manhattan, Miami, Paris and upstate New York. The library of his New York townhouse, with its towering bookcases, a portrait of George Eliot and a photo of the Chekhov family, was a shrine to literature. But it also reflected his taste for kitsch -- plastic women's handbags and a triptych of 3-D dog posters, picked up at flea markets for $ 1 each.
Besides his memoir, Mr. Gottlieb wrote biographies of the actress Sarah Bernhardt and the choreographer George Balanchine, a book on the children of Charles Dickens, and articles for The New York Review of Books and many other publications.
His later books were "Near-Death Experiences ... and Others" (2018), a collection of essays written mostly for The New York Review of Books, and "Garbo" (2021), a biography of the enigmatic film star. But he always regarded himself as an editor -- floating somewhere in the background.
"The editor's relationship to a book should be an invisible one," Mr. Gottlieb told The Paris Review in 1994. "The last thing anyone reading 'Jane Eyre' would want to know, for example, is that I had convinced Charlotte Brontë that the first Mrs. Rochester should go up in flames."

Music Publishers Seek $250 Million In Copyright Suit Against Twitter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A group of 17 music publishers sued the social media company and said it was seeking as much as $ 250 million in damages.
A group of 17 music publishers sued Twitter on Wednesday, accusing it of copyright infringement on about 1,700 songs, and is seeking as much as $ 250 million in damages, the latest headache for the social media platform owned by Elon Musk.
The publishers filed the suit in Federal District Court in Nashville, saying Twitter violated copyright law by allowing users to post music to the platform without permission. Negotiations between Twitter and the music industry to put broad licensing agreements into place had broken down months ago.
"Twitter stands alone as the largest social media platform that has completely refused to license the millions of songs on its service," David Israelite, the president of the National Music Publishers' Association, a trade group, said in a statement.
Twitter and Mr. Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The suit detailed what the publishers say is Twitter's failure to police rampant infringement of music copyrights on the service. It pointed to specific tweets in which music has been used without permission, including a post about Rihanna's song "Umbrella" that included what the suit said is two minutes of the song's music video. The post had 221,000 views and 15,000 likes, the suit said, but not the permission of the song's publishers.
The suit asked for statutory damages of up to $ 150,000 for each of nearly 1,700 infringed works, for a total of about $ 250 million.
Music publishers represent the copyrights for songwriting and composition, which are separate from the copyrights for recordings.
The suit also documents the music publishers' attempts to notify Twitter about infringement through the protocol outlined in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 law that protects internet service providers when users post copyrighted materials, but outlines a series of guidelines for how they can be taken down.
According to the suit, the National Music Publishers' Association notified Twitter of about 300,000 tweets with infringing music since December 2021. The company routinely delayed or failed to act on those notices, the suit said.
Twitter had been in negotiations for licensing rights with the three major music labels -- Universal, Sony and Warner -- since 2021, though the talks stalled after Mr. Musk's $ 44 billion takeover of the company in October. Deals for music rights, which require social media companies to compensate publishers and record labels when users post or play content with songs, can cost well over $ 100 million a year.
Since buying Twitter, Mr. Musk has slashed costs by laying off workers, skipping rent payments and avoiding paying bills to various vendors. Advertising revenue has declined and the company faces billions of dollars in debt payments from Mr. Musk's acquisition. Mr. Musk has said Twitter was on the path to bankruptcy.
The suit tries to use Mr. Musk's own words against him. It cited a series of his tweets in which he said current copyright law "goes absurdly far beyond protecting the original creator." He added, "Overzealous DMCA is a plague on humanity."

'Wheel of Fortune' Will Spin Without Pat Sajak in 2024: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The game show host, a mainstay of American television, has starred on the program since 1981. He said he would step down in 2024.
Pat Sajak, who has been one of the most familiar faces on American television for over four decades as the host of "Wheel of Fortune," announced on Monday that he would retire next year.
"The time has come," Mr. Sajak, 76, said on Twitter. "I've decided that our 41st season, which begins in September, will be my last."
"Wheel of Fortune" has been one of the most watched syndicated shows on American TV for much of Mr. Sajak's run as host, and it was the most watched by the mid-1980s, when it drew more than 40 million viewers daily. The show became a pop culture phenomenon -- known for its catchphrase "Can I buy a vowel?" -- and spawned board games, toys, clothes and the spinoff show "Celebrity Wheel of Fortune." Airing on ABC affiliates, "Wheel of Fortune" still draws over nine million viewers daily, second only to "Jeopardy!" for syndicated shows.
Mr. Sajak plans to continue as a consultant for three years after his final season.
It is unclear who will take over the hosting duties for Mr. Sajak, a three-time Emmy winner and the recipient of the Daytime Emmy lifetime achievement award.
Vanna White, Mr. Sajak's longtime co-host, who joined the daytime version of the show in 1982, said on Twitter on Tuesday, "Who could have imagined we'd still be at it 41 seasons later?"
"I couldn't be happier to have shared the stage with you for all these years with one more to come," Ms. White wrote. She briefly stepped in for Mr. Sajak in 2019, when he needed emergency surgery to fix a blocked intestine.
While Ms. White filled in for Mr. Sajak, his daughter, Maggie Sajak, took over Ms. White's puzzle-board duties. Ms. Sajak is a social correspondent for the show, posting digital content.
The show, created by Merv Griffin in 1975, features contestants who try to guess the letters in word puzzles to compete for cash. More than $ 250 million has been awarded since the show premiered, according to Sony.
Mr. Griffin, who died in 2007, choose Mr. Sajak to host the program in 1981, replacing Chuck Woolery, the show's original host.
Before joining "Wheel of Fortune," Mr. Sajak had been working in Los Angeles as a weatherman for KNBC, according to the show.
"The nice thing about working in local TV in L.A.," Mr. Sajak once said, according to the show, "is that the decision makers are watching you every night."
Mr. Sajak's retirement will create a void in game show programming that draws few parallels other than the exit of Alex Trebek, the longtime host of "Jeopardy!," who died at age 80 in 2020. Since Mr. Griffin revived that show in 1984, "Jeopardy!" has been paired with "Wheel of Fortune" in syndication.
Mr. Sajak was born in Chicago on Oct. 26, 1946. After graduating from high school, Mr. Sajak attended Columbia College Chicago, and he began working for a local radio station for its overnight programming from midnight to 6 a.m., according to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which awarded Mr. Sajak a star in 1994.
In 1968, Mr. Sajak joined the United States Army and was sent to Vietnam, where he worked on the Armed Forces Radio, according to "Wheel of Fortune." When he returned stateside after his discharge from the Army, Mr. Sajak spent five years at a TV station in Nashville, where he worked as a weatherman and talk show host.
He then moved to Los Angeles, where he eventually worked for KNBC as a weatherman and on a Sunday talk show.
"It was a weird show," Sajak said in an 1988 interview of his time at KNBC. "You'd be out on a trout farm interviewing people who had nothing to do with fish, or they'd send us to a Polish kielbasa festival to conduct a debate between opposing factions on gun control. It was good training, in retrospect. You learned how to tap dance."
In 1989, Mr. Sajak tried a brief foray into late-night TV. "The Pat Sajak Show" took on Johnny Carson and David Letterman, but was canceled in 1990.
Mr. Sajak has drawn some criticism over the years from fans of the show who have said he is unfair at times to contestants. He also drew backlash last year when a picture circulated online of him with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, who is known for her far-right stances.
Mr. Sajak has also had a number of cameos on several TV shows and movies, such as "Muppets Haunted Mansion" and "Airplane II: The Sequel."
During his tenure as host, more than 10,000 people have auditioned for "Wheel of Fortune," according to Sony Pictures Television, the studio that owns it.
Suzanne Prete, the studio's executive vice president of game shows, said in a statement on Monday night that the studio was "incredibly grateful and proud to have had Pat as our host for all these years."

F.T.C. Sues To Stop Deal For Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The agency had sued to halt the blockbuster deal last year. Its latest move in federal court would prevent the acquisition from being completed.
The Federal Trade Commission sued Microsoft on Monday to stop the company from closing its $ 69 billion purchase of the video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard, escalating the federal government's efforts to stymie the largest consumer technology deal in decades.
In the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the F.T.C. said the move was necessary because "Microsoft and Activision have represented that they may consummate" the deal. It asked the court to issue an order blocking the acquisition's closing by the end of the day on Thursday.
The lawsuit is the latest blow to Microsoft's purchase of Activision, which makes popular video games like Call of Duty and Candy Crush. Last year, the F.T.C. sued to block the deal through an in-house court, arguing it would damage competition in various parts of the video game market. The agency filed the separate lawsuit because unlike the F.T.C.'s in-house court, a federal court can issue a restraining order to stop a purchase from being completed.
Regulatory hurdles have piled up against the blockbuster deal, which has become a test for whether behemoth tech companies can complete major acquisitions amid backlash to the firms' growing power. In April, the British Competition and Markets Authority also moved to stop the deal, though regulators in the European Union said in May that it could go forward.
Governments around the world have been challenging the power of tech giants like Microsoft. The F.T.C. has accused Meta, Facebook's parent company, of shutting off nascent competitors and has been investigating whether Amazon ran afoul of antitrust laws. The Department of Justice has filed multiple lawsuits arguing that Google has committed antitrust violations of its own.
Microsoft has appealed the British ruling to block the Activision deal and has pledged to fight the F.T.C. in court. The two companies had said they hoped the purchase would close by July.
The British portions of the deal cannot close while Microsoft's appeal moves forward. If a federal court grants the F.T.C.'s demand to stop the deal, it would also prevent Microsoft from completing the transaction in the United States.
Bill Baer, a former top government antitrust official, said the F.T.C.'s lawsuit was a response to the risk that Microsoft would try and circumvent the British ruling and "cause the injury the F.TC. is worried about" by closing the deal elsewhere.
Victoria Graham, a spokeswoman for the F.T.C., said in a statement that "Microsoft and Activision have not provided assurances" that they would not close the deal.
In a statement, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said the company welcomed the "opportunity to present our case in federal court."
Bobby Kotick, the chief executive of Activision, said in a note to employees that the company welcomed the news because it "accelerates the legal process." He added: "We will now have the opportunity to more quickly present the facts about our merger."
If Microsoft ushers the deal through, it would be a monumental moment for the $ 184 billion gaming industry. Microsoft earns billions of dollars each year in the video game business, but competitors like Nintendo and Sony -- which makes the PlayStation console -- have long been considered to have a better catalog of games that attract players to their devices. Adding Activision and its slate of gaming studios to Microsoft's Xbox consoles and its games subscription service could even the playing field.
Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, has made blocking corporate deals a cornerstone of her strategy to rein in the tech giants and other big companies. The chip maker Nvidia and the defense contractor Lockheed Martin have dropped proposed deals after they were challenged by the F.T.C. under Ms. Khan.
Attempts to block other deals have been less successful. Last year, the F.T.C. tried to stop Meta from buying Within, a start-up that makes a virtual reality fitness game. A federal judge declined to stop the deal from closing, and the F.T.C. dropped its broader challenge to the purchase.
Microsoft has worked to gain approval from regulators for the Activision acquisition. Since announcing the deal a year and a half ago, the company has embarked on a charm offensive, meeting with regulators around the world and cutting deals with other gaming companies to assuage concerns that the deal would reduce availability of Activision's games and raise their prices.
But those moves failed to persuade the British and American regulators to approve the deal. The new lawsuit by the F.T.C., analysts said, could be an effort by the United States to regain some prominence in the legal fight, as well as an acknowledgment that Microsoft could close the deal despite Britain's objections.
"The F.T.C. is reaffirming how adamant it is about blocking this deal," said Joost van Dreunen, a gaming analyst and professor at New York University. "They want to make sure that they are still driving the bus in this."

Teenage Fan's Homage Becomes Movie Reality: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Preston Mutanga created a shot-for-shot version of the trailer with animated Lego characters. Then the producers asked him to work on the movie.
Early in the thrill-packed sequel "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse," the story takes a brief yet memorable detour into a dimension that resembles Lego building blocks and figures.
The clever and amusing scene, a tribute to "The Lego Movie," was not the work of seasoned animation artists, but that of a 14-year-old fan turned professional creator living in Toronto.
Preston Mutanga, the prodigious Minnesota-born son of immigrant parents from the Northwest Region of Cameroon, had shown a flair for creativity from a young age. Forgoing the instructions for a set of Lego blocks, he built cars with his own designs.
"I also used to make comics when I was younger," Mutanga said during a recent video interview. "Looking back at them now, they're not the greatest, I'm not going to lie, but it was good practice for telling stories."
In December, the teenager started a project that would change the course of his young ambitions. Using his father's old computers, Mutanga recreated the trailer for "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" shot for shot to look as if it belonged in a Lego world.
By that point, he had been honing his skills for several years making short computer-generated Lego videos. "My dad showed me this 3-D software called Blender and I instantly got hooked on it," he said. "I watched a lot of YouTube videos to teach myself certain stuff."
He shared his version of the trailer online. The quality of his self-taught craftsmanship quickly gained attention and reached Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the directors of "The Lego Movie" and two of the writer-producers of "Spider-Verse."
After deciding to include a segment in a Lego universe, Christina Steinberg, another of the film's producers, contacted Mutanga to ask him if he wanted to animate it.
"We found out that it was a 14-year-old kid who made it and we were like, 'This looks incredibly sophisticated for a nonadult, nonprofessional to have made," Miller said on a video call. "It blew us all away, including some of the best animators in the world."
Mutanga's supportive parents, Theodore and Gisele Mutanga, were skeptical when the production first contacted them. Not long before, their son's YouTube channel had been hacked, so the couple was reasonably wary that a Hollywood studio was seeking their son's talent.
But after finding the movie's Toronto-based production designer, Patrick O'Keefe, on LinkedIn, and confirming that Sony Pictures Animation's offer was legitimate, Theodore Mutanga, a medical physicist, built his son a new computer and bought him a state-of-the-art graphics card so he could render his work much faster.
His mother, Gisele Mutanga, a public health instructor, said, "I know Preston has a gift that was given to him by God, and once we identified that he had that gift, all we could do as parents was to nurture it and let him fly."
Over several weeks, first during spring break and then after finishing his homework on school nights, Mutanga worked on the Lego sequence. Every other week, he would meet via video with Miller, who would check on his progress and provide detailed input.
For the young storyteller, accustomed to working alone with complete creative freedom, collaborating as part of a larger production provided eye-opening. "One new thing I learned was definitely the feedback aspect of it, like how much stuff actually gets changed from the beginning to the final product," Mutanga said.
Miller saw Mutanga's contribution to "Across the Spider-Verse" not only as a testament to the democratization of filmmaking, but also to the artist's perseverance: he dedicated intensive time and effort to animation, which is "not ever fast or easy to make," Miller said.
"'The Lego Movie' is inspired by people making films with Lego bricks at home," Lord said by video. "That's what made us want to make the movie. Then the idea in 'Spider Verse' is that a hero can come from anywhere. And here comes this heroic young person who's inspired by the movie that was inspired by people like him."
While Mutanga is still dedicated to his high school studies, his career goal of becoming a full-time animator and director feels more within reach than he or his parents might have imagined at this stage. "I adored the first movie and was so hyped for the second one, so getting to work with the people who actually made this masterpiece was honestly like a dream," he said.

Would You Spend $3,500 On This?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: I briefly got my hands on Apple's new high-tech goggles, which impressed and creeped me out and raised a question: Why do we need these?
I got a sneak peek into Apple's vision for the future of computing on Monday. For about half an hour, I wore the $ 3,500 Vision Pro, the company's first high-tech goggles, which will be released next year.
I walked away with mixed feelings, including a nagging sense of skepticism.
On one hand, I was impressed with the quality of the headset, which Apple bills as the beginning of an era of "spatial computing," where digital data blends with the physical world to unlock new capabilities. Imagine wearing a headset to assemble furniture while the instructions are digitally projected onto the parts, for instance, or cooking a meal while a recipe is displayed in the corner of your eye.
Apple's device had high-resolution video, intuitive controls and a comfortable fit, which felt superior to my experiences with headsets made in the last decade by Meta, Magic Leap, Sony and others.
But after wearing the new headset to view photos and interact with a virtual dinosaur, I also felt there wasn't much new to see here. And the experience elicited an "ick" factor I had never had before with an Apple product. More on this later.
Fit and control
Let me start from the beginning. After Apple unveiled the headset on Monday, its first major new release since the Apple Watch in 2015, I was permitted to try a preproduction model of the Vision Pro. Apple staff led me to a private room at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and sat me on a couch for a demo.
The Vision Pro, which resembles a pair of ski goggles, has a white USB cable that plugs into a silver battery pack that I slipped into the pocket of my jeans. To put it on my face, I turned a knob on the side of the headset to adjust the snugness and secured a Velcro strap above my head.
I pressed down on a metal button toward the front of the device to turn it on. Then I ran through a setup process, which involved looking at a moving dot so the headset could lock in on my eye movements. The Vision Pro has an array of sensors to track eye movements, hand gestures and voice commands, which are the primary ways to control it. Looking at an icon is equivalent to hovering over it with a mouse cursor; to press a button, you tap your thumb and index fingers together, making a quick pinch that is equivalent to clicking a mouse.
The pinch gesture was also used for grabbing and moving around apps on the screen. It was intuitive and felt less clunky than waving around the motion controllers that typically come with competing handsets.
But it raised questions. What other hand gestures would the headset recognize for playing games? How good will voice controls be if Siri's voice transcription on phones currently doesn't work well? Apple isn't sure yet what other gestures will be supported, and it didn't let me try voice controls.
All the many uses?
Then came time for the app demos to show how the headset might enrich our everyday lives and help us stay connected with one another.
Apple first walked me through looking at photos and a video of a birthday party on the headset. I could turn a dial near the front of the Vision Pro counterclockwise to make the photo backgrounds more transparent and see the real world, including the Apple employees around me, or turn it clockwise to make the photo more opaque to immerse myself.
Apple also had me open a meditation app in the headset that showed 3-D animations while soothing music played and a voice instructed me to breathe. But the meditation couldn't prepare me for what was coming next: a video call.
A small window popped up -- a notification of a FaceTime call from another Apple employee wearing the headset. I stared at the answer button and pinched to take the call.
The Apple employee in the video call was using a "persona," an animated 3-D avatar of herself that the headset created using a scan of her face. Apple portrays videoconferencing through the personas as a more intimate way for people to communicate and even collaborate in virtual space.
The Apple employee's facial expressions looked lifelike, and her mouth movements synchronized with her speech. But because of how her avatar was digitally rendered, with the uniform texture of her face and the lack of shadows, I could tell it was fake. It resembled a video hologram I had seen in sci-fi movies like "Minority Report."
In the FaceTime session, the Apple employee and I were supposed to collaborate on making a 3-D model in an app called Freeform. But I stared at it blankly, thinking about what I was seeing. After three years of my being mostly isolated during the pandemic, Apple wanted me to engage with what was essentially a deepfake video of a real person. I could feel myself shutting down. My "ick" sensation was probably what technologists have long described as uncanny valley, a feeling of unease when a human sees a machine creation that looks too human.
A technological feat? Yes. A feature I would want to use with others every day? Probably not anytime soon.
To wrap the demonstration with something fun, Apple showed a simulation of a dinosaur that moved toward me when I reached my hand out. I have seen more than my fair share of digital dinosaurs in virtual reality (almost every headset maker that's given me a VR demo has shown a Jurassic Park simulation in the last seven years), and I was not excited about this.
Real people
After the demo, I drove home and processed the experience during rush hour.
Over dinner, I talked to my wife about the Vision Pro. The Apple goggles, I said, looked and felt better than the competing headsets. But I wasn't sure that mattered.
Other headsets from Meta and Sony PlayStation were much cheaper and already quite powerful and entertaining, especially for playing video games. But whenever we had guests over for dinner and they tried the goggles on, they lost interest after less than half an hour because the experience was exhausting and they felt socially disconnected from the group.
Would it matter if they could twist the dial on the front of the headset to see into the real world while wearing it? I suspect it would still feel isolating, because they would probably be the only person in a room wearing one.
But more important to me was the idea of connecting with others, including family members and colleagues, through Apple headsets.
"Your mom is getting old," I said to my wife. "When you're FaceTiming with her, would you rather see her deepfake digital avatar, or a crummier video call where she's holding the phone camera up to her face at an unflattering angle?"
"The latter," she said without hesitation. "That's real. Although, I'd much rather see her in person."

Full text: The directors of this sequel discuss their diverging influences, from Leonardo da Vinci to the movie "Say Anything."
In the 2018 animated hit "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Miles Morales, a Brooklyn teenage superhero in development, receives multiple unexpected visits from other dimensions. For the film's sequel, "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse," it's Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) who must follow Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), a version of Spider-Woman, into new realms where other spider people exist.
For the films' directors, Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson, the premise, with Miles now as a traveler and not a host, granted them permission to expand their aesthetic horizons. This time the task wasn't limited to creating uniquely designed characters inhabiting a single universe, but entire worlds based on the myriad comic book sagas that have reinterpreted Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's arachnid paladin.
"It's almost like we're jumping from one book to another," Thompson said. "The goal was to take people on a journey and have a celebration of all these different amazing artists."
To do so, the production went to the source and contacted some of the people behind those alternate "Spider-Man" visions to participate in the development of the film. Rick Leonardi, who designed the comic "Spider-Man 2099," came on board to help devise 3-D animation tools that could emulate his line work. And Brian Stelfreeze, a seasoned artist for Marvel Comics, was instrumental in formulating the film's take on Jessica Drew/Spider-Woman.
Calling from different areas in Los Angeles -- a city that could be its own Spider-Verse -- for a video interview, the three filmmakers dissected some of the other ideas swirling in their reference pool.
Leonardo da Vinci and Royal de Luxe
Early in this multiverse adventure, a villain named Vulture unexpectedly enters Gwen's colorful world. Native to another reality, the monochromatic character wielding a variety of gadgets, who looks as if drawn on parchment paper, had to clearly and immediately feel foreign to the world he was invading. Sketches by the Renaissance artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci served as a foundation for his design.
"Vulture's contraptions were like a hyper-realized version of a lot of the insane inventions that da Vinci himself had come up with, which, some of them were crazy, some of them were very forward thinking," Dos Santos said. "Some of them were frankly horrific."
Another crucial inspiration during the initial development of the character was the work of Royal de Luxe, a street theater company based in Nantes, France, that specializes in creating large-scale marionettes.
'Say Anything'
The only quiet alone time Miles and Gwen have in the entire film occurs as they both gaze at an inverted New York skyline. As breathtaking and significant as the sequence is, it went in and out of the movie on multiple occasions. "It had to really earn its way into the film," Powers said. Throughout the process, he found himself thinking of Cameron Crowe's innocent romance "Say Anything." The male lead in that film, Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack), tries to convince his love interest Diane Court (Ione Skye) to give their unlikely match a chance even though her father disapproves. "There's definitely a parallel there because Gwen has these mentor figures in her life who are urging her to stay away from Miles Morales for reasons that our audience will discover," Powers said. But, of course, having a swoon-worthy Cameron Crowe moment between two spider people with amazing abilities had to have an extraordinary setting, namely a clock tower while they both hang upside down.
'Cinderella'
Gwen's world functions like a mood ring that reacts to her emotions. For example, if she feels angry, the screen turns red and the atmosphere hotter. And when confusion overtakes her, the world becomes fragmented. According to Thompson, the 1950 animated Disney classic "Cinderella" served as a reference. "As a kid, I remember seeing the scene when Cinderella's dress is being torn apart by the evil stepsisters, and the backgrounds and the environment start reacting to this emotional trauma that she's going through," he said. For him, these moments in Gwen's reactive microcosm push the film into its most experiential form.
Jet Propulsion Laboratory
The production visited NASA's research and development center in La Cañada Flintridge, Calif., to research how cutting-edge technology could apply to the characters in their film. They hoped to figure out how Miguel O'Hara, a brilliant geneticist who becomes the Spider-Man of the year 2099, could create a tear-resistant, high-tech wingsuit with powerful flying capabilities, and what materials it would be made out of if it actually existed in our world.
To optimize the look of Spider-Byte, a spider person who fights crime in a cyberspace multiverse and appears translucid, the filmmakers explored current techniques that are right on the cusp of creating three-dimensional holograms in real time. "We aren't just putting her onscreen and then putting her at a slight opacity," Thompson said. "There are specific techniques that we delved deep into to give her a sense of presence onscreen that feels like she's beyond just somebody wearing a suit."
'Point Break' and 'No Country for Old Men'
For Powers, there were two high-water marks of great character development through an action sequence that bled into the retro-futuristic realm of Spider-Man 2099. One of them is the foot chase in Kathryn Bigelow's "Point Break" where Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) tries to catch Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). "It was bizarre and funny, and it implemented things that we'd learned about the characters early in the film, namely that Utah injured his knee playing football," Powers said. A similar chase unfolds in "Across the Spider-Verse."
The other reference at the front of Powers's mind was the Coen brothers' "No Country for Old Men." In that film, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) remains defiant in the face of the psychopathic hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Even if there's an inevitability to how it will all be resolved, Moss fights back and "gets his licks in," as Powers put it.
"Miles is being chased too," he added, "but we still want him to get his licks in."

Full text: This charming sequel to the 2018 animated movie expands the multiverse concept, without shamelessly capitalizing on fan service.
Question: How many Spider-Men does it take to make a successful multiverse sequel?
I'm not certain, but it might be the countless number of Spideys that appear in the delightful "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse."
A follow-up to the appropriately lauded "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," this animated movie takes place a year after the Brooklyn teen and newly minted Spider-Man, Miles Morales (voiced again by Shameik Moore), was bitten by a radioactive spider. In "Into the Spider-Verse," from 2018, Miles learned how to be his city's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man with the help of five other Spider-heroes -- all different Spidey incarnations transported from their original universes after a super collider explosion tore through the multiverse. Now Miles is 15, and though he has a handle on his powers, he's struggling to balance academics with his extracurricular hero work, on top of the usual adolescent woes.
As Miles's parents get increasingly suspicious about their son's double life, he has to fend off the pesky villain Spot (Jason Schwartzman, as the perfect goober), who powers up into a "transdimensional super-being" who poses a real threat to the multiverse.
In her separate universe Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), a.k.a. Spider-Woman, Miles's pal and quasi-romantic interest from the first film, joins a task force of multiverse-jumping heroes called the Spider Society. They chase anomalies stuck in the wrong world in missions led by the brooding Spider-Man 2099, Miguel O'Hara (Oscar Isaac). But once Gwen and Miles reunite, and Miles discovers the Spider Society, he finds out he might actually be the real threat to the Spider-Verse.

"Spider-Verse" achieves the challenging task of building a sequel that not only replicates the charms of the first film but also expands the multiverse concept, the main characters and the stakes, without overinflating the premise or shamelessly capitalizing on fan service. In other words, "Across the Spider-Verse" pulls off a "Spider-Man: No Way Home," the Tom Holland vehicle that also played with alternate versions of Spider-Man, better than "No Way Home" did. That includes its inclusion of clips and cameos from former animated and live-action Spider-Man media, which nicely cohere with the rest of the film.
The Spider Society, with its delightfully bizarre potpourri of spider-entities (i.e., a Spider-Cowboy, Spider-Cat, Spider-Baby and Spider-Dinosaur), offers many opportunities for the movie to show off a compelling blend of visual gags, palettes and animation styles. The eye-catching action sequences among the Spider-folk serve the delectable chaos of a meme (yes, that pointing meme) exploded in a big-screen format.
Each Spidey we encounter, even briefly, is fully realized, and a welcome addition to the story, even for those who might not pick up on the deep-cut references to the '80s and '90s comics. Pavitr Prabhakar (Karan Soni), a.k.a. Spider-Man India, is designed with nods to contemporary Indian fashion. Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya), a contrarian cool-guy rocker with combat boots, piercings and a devil-may-care attitude, is drawn in the wild 2-D-collage style of album covers, concert fliers and zines from the '80s London punk scene. And the way they move -- Pavitr's fluid web-slinging, Spider-Punk's stomps and thrashing and Gwen's graceful acrobatics and en pointe landings -- express as much about the characters as the buoyant dialogue and highly stylized character designs.
That's not even counting the work of the impressive voice cast. Issa Rae brings an affable tough-love vibe to her pregnant, kinky-haired, motorcycle-riding Spider-Woman Jessica Drew. And Isaac, who brings as an exacting a performance as he did in the Disney+ series "Moon Knight," is well-cast as the slightly unhinged and self-serious Spider-Man, à la the Dark Knight.
Steinfeld's Gwen, a fan fave, thankfully gets more spotlight in this film, which delves deeper into her tragic back story and her feelings of displacement in her world, particularly in her own home. She gets a driving pop-punk theme -- part of a killer soundtrack raging with rock, hip-hop and reggaeton -- and a stunning color-streaked aesthetic, with soft pinks and lavenders and heavy brushstrokes, creating an almost immersive comic book experience.
The directing team, Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson, builds a beautifully realistic, multicultural New York through details: a wheelchair basketball game in full swing on a nearby court, or a shelf of beef patties displayed in a Jamaican bodega.
Both "Spider-Verse" films, in what will be a trilogy, create dimension in these kinds of details, and I don't just mean the animation. (Though, to be fair, the infinite reach of the city skyline, as viewed upside down from Gwen and Miles's purview, is a satisfying visual callback to the first film and its own illustrative feat.) The dimension is in the thrust of the story itself.
This isn't just another multiverse slogfest but a bildungsroman. Because what else is adolescence but a confrontation with the various possibilities in life, the infinite selves you can be? It's about figuring out one's identity -- superhero or otherwise -- and finding a place to belong. The fact that Miles and Gwen also shoot webs and swing around skyscrapers is incidental to their emotional arcs in the film.
"Spider-Verse" also asks intriguing questions about the limitations of the canon, and whether tragedy is a prerequisite for a Spider-Man origin story -- the death of an Uncle Ben or Aunt May or Uncle Aaron. And whether trauma completely defines these heroes -- and, if so, if they can find kinship in that.
The most disappointing part of "Spider-Verse" is the merciless cliffhanger of an ending, ushering the film into a tradition of two-parters with too much story and too little time to tell it. But "Across the Spider-Verse" is never dull, nor precious with its characters and comedy. Which I suppose just proves that when it comes to a Spidey census, two's a team, three's a party and hundreds is a multiverse crawling with opportunities.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
Rated PG. Running time: 2 hours 20 minutes. In theaters.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Rated PG for ferocious web-slinging and spider-trauma. Running time: 2 hours 20 minutes. In theaters.

Gone to Seed, With Some Seedy Company: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a movie extrapolated from one of his stand-up bits, Bert Kreischer is dragged to Russia to face a gory but still comedic reckoning.
The star of this picture, Bert Kreischer, is one of those popular stand-up comedians who's not zeitgeist-adjacent enough to generate much in the way of think pieces or buzz. But in the late 1990s, as a student at Florida State University, he was the subject of a Rolling Stone magazine profile that named him "the top partyer at the Number One Party School in the country."
The late 1990s were a while ago, and today Kreischer is a hefty 50-year-old who looks mildly partied out. That's part of his shtick -- he performs stand-up while shirtless. In "The Machine," he plays a fictionalized version of himself, initially in a penitent mode -- a family man who's royally ticked off his clan. At his daughter's 16th birthday party, Bert and his carpet salesman dad, Albert, are accosted, at gunpoint, by the mobster Irina (Iva Babic) and taken to Russia, where Bert is to make amends for his part in a drunken train robbery decades before.
This gore-steeped shaggy dog story is extrapolated from an actual Kreischer bit. As they dodge a score of Slavic psycho killers who are after an heirloom Bert stole, father and son hash out their issues (of course).
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
You may wonder, if Kreischer is such a popular stand-up comedian, why he hasn't done more television and movie acting. Well. Here he hits his marks and stays in his persona lane, but he's not a performer who can carry a movie. Mark Hamill, as his dad, comes closer to crusty-old-man territory than one might have predicted. He's practically Wilford Brimley.
The director Peter Atencio has gotten reasonable results in the absurdist meta-comedy realm ("Keanu," for instance), but he can't cook with these ingredients. Even when the relentlessly salty humor gets fully crass (a dog is thrown out a high window), the product is bland.
The Machine
Rated R for language, gore and extreme partying. Running time: 1 hour 52 minutes. In theaters.

Films to Make You Laugh, Cry or Tremble: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Our genre experts pick the films they are most excited about seeing.
From web-slinging diversions to archaeological excursions, this summer movie season is stacked with releases across a variety of genres. Our writers who seek out the most interesting picks in horror, international, science fiction, action and children's movies each month scoured the summer calendar to come up with the films that have their attention.
Horror
"Host," Rob Savage's terrifying 2020 found-footage movie about a possessed online séance, will go down as a defining pandemic-inspired horror film.
That's why I'm looking forward to seeing what the British director does with a bigger budget and a Stephen King short story as inspiration, when his new film, "The Boogeyman," opens in theaters on June 2. Sophie Thatcher stars as a young woman who battles a home-invading supernatural entity that feeds on the suffering of its victims.
As much as I wish Patrick Wilson would come back to Broadway -- he would nail "The Right Girl" from "Follies" -- I'm excited to see that he's returning to horror with "Insidious: The Red Door," the fifth film in the franchise, which opens in theaters July 7. Not only is Wilson reprising his role as Josh Lambert, father to a now college-age son, but he's also making his directing debut. Color me curious. -- ERIK PIEPENBURG
International
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This summer will see the release of new films from some masters of world cinema -- I recommend Christian Petzold's "Afire," Claire Simon's "Our Body" and Pietro Marcello's "Scarlet" -- but I'm also waiting with bated breath for a couple of debut features arriving after garnering accolades at film festivals.
"Falcon Lake" (June 2), by the Canadian actress Charlotte Le Bon, is a new entry in the best summer genre: the coming-of-age movie. The film adapts "A Sister," the acclaimed graphic novel by Bastien Vivès, about a teenager who has his first brushes with desire and grief during a vacation.
"Girlfriends and Girlfriends" (June 28), by the Spanish filmmaker Zaida Carmona, promises a boldly queer riff on another classic seasonal theme: breaking up and making up (several times with several people, going by the sensuous trailer). What better to do in the heat and idleness of summer than find love, and maybe yourself, too? -- DEVIKA GIRISH
Science Fiction
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's hard to be interested in science fiction and not be curious about how the particular -- in every sense of the word -- filmmaker Wes Anderson is going to approach the genre in "Asteroid City" (June 16).
Set in 1955, the film brings together students and parents attending a Junior Stargazer/Space Cadet convention in a desert town on Asteroid Day. The occasion is the annual commemoration of a meteorite hitting the area thousands of years earlier -- a possible fragment was long thought to have been from "the hypothetical planet Magnavox-27." Nothing much has leaked about the rest of the plot, but "Asteroid City," shot in fantastically sun-bleached colors, appears to offer a humorous take on the 1950s fascination with flying saucers and visitors from outer space. And of course, it looks very Andersonian in that it's art-directed to the max and packed with stars having a lark. What's out there? I can't wait to find out this director's answer. -- ELISABETH VINCENTELLI
Action
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
From his boundless charisma to his rugged presence, Harrison Ford is our greatest action star -- and the hunky archaeologist Indiana Jones, with his bullwhip and fedora, is his greatest role. As a man who's always on the right side of history, he manages to embody the idealization of the American spirit while critiquing its difficult reality.
While the series showed Jones retrieving supernaturally powerful holy relics from the Nazis in its first film, and revisited that theme in "The Last Crusade," the fourth installment abruptly shifted to being about aliens and the Red Scare. That quick turn makes the latest, "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" (June 30), a fascinating opportunity: Will the director James Mangold continue down the previous movie's otherworldly path? Also, how will Ford conclude this character? With a deep ensemble including Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Mads Mikkelsen and Antonio Banderas -- and a trailer boasting a surprisingly realistic de-aging of Ford -- this return should be a ride into the sunset worth taking. -- ROBERT DANIELS
Children's Movies
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I'm a firm believer that Miles Morales is cooler than Peter Parker, so "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" (June 2) is a sequel I have been eagerly awaiting. The Oscar-winning "Into the Spider-Verse" was the first feature that held my son's full attention. If it entertains a rambunctious preschooler, you know there's some sort of magic alchemy happening onscreen.
Typically a remake of a movie inspired by a theme park wouldn't inspire me to sprint to a theater, but Disney's "Haunted Mansion" (July 28) is directed by Justin Simien ("Dear White People"), and the cast is solid. It might be a tad scary for little ones who don't appreciate stories about ghosts, but for kids who love some Disney-level scares, this looks promising. Also, I will watch anything that LaKeith Stanfield is in. No matter how the rest of the movie shakes out, you know he'll be riveting. -- DINA GACHMAN

Full text: Barbie springs to life, Indy swings into action and Spidey slings new webs. Here are 107 films for movie lovers of all tastes.
Here is a list of noteworthy movies heading to theaters and living rooms this summer -- everything from blockbusters to small indies from the festival circuit. Release dates and platforms are subject to change.
May
REALITY Tina Satter wrote and directed this screen adaptation of her play "Is This a Room," derived from the transcript of the F.B.I.'s interrogation of Reality L. Winner, the National Security Agency contractor who was sentenced for leaking classified information. Sydney Sweeney stars as Winner. (May 29 on Max)
June
AFTER SHERMAN The filmmaker Jon-Sesrie Goff documents the experiences of his father, the Rev. Dr. Norvel Goff Sr., who became the interim pastor at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, S.C., after Dylann Roof killed nine people there in 2015. The documentary reflects on the role of faith for Black Americans. (June 2 in theaters)
THE BOOGEYMAN A Stephen King short story from the 1970s becomes a feature film. Sophie Thatcher plays a teenager fending off an entity that feeds on her sorrow over her mother's death. Rob Savage directed. (June 2 in theaters)
FALCON LAKE The actress Charlotte Le Bon (Robert Zemeckis's "The Walk") makes her directorial debut with this story of a boy and the girl he's drawn to while on vacation by a lake that might be haunted. (June 2 in theaters)
LYNCH/OZ David Lynch fans well know his love for "The Wizard of Oz," which seeps into his work in ways both overt (Sheryl Lee's appearance as the Good Witch in "Wild at Heart") and fascinatingly subtextual (the cast rearrangement in "Mulholland Drive"). Alexandre O. Philippe, a specialist in documentaries about movies ("78/52: Hitchcock's Shower Scene"), charts the connections. (June 2 in theaters)
PADRE PIO Shia LaBeouf plays the title character, a Capuchin friar who was canonized in 2002, and whose followers believe that in 1918 he bore the stigmata, wounds corresponding to those of Christ. Cristina Chiriac and Asia Argento also star. Abel Ferrara directed. (June 2 in theaters and on demand)
PAST LIVES Celine Song wrote and directed this near-universal critical favorite from Sundance. Greta Lee and Teo Yoo play two people who, although close friends as children in South Korea, came of age separately after one emigrated to Canada. The film, which makes multiple leaps in time, follows their interactions over the years as they ponder the romance that might have been but wasn't. John Magaro also stars. (June 2 in theaters)
SHOOTING STARS Marquis "Mookie" Cook plays LeBron James in his high school years, in a movie based on the book James wrote with Buzz Bissinger ("Friday Night Lights"). (June 2 on Peacock)
SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE Reboots and multiverses make it difficult to keep track of all the Spider-Men -- but when multiverses are involved, that tends to be the point. Shameik Moore returns as the voice of Miles Morales in this sequel to the 2018 animated film "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse." Kemp Powers ("Soul") directs alongside Joaquim Dos Santos and Justin K. Thompson. (June 2 in theaters)
HOLLYWOOD DREAMS & NIGHTMARES: THE ROBERT ENGLUND STORY Would you recognize Englund if you saw him without Freddy Krueger's charred face and blade-fingers? (OK, if you saw the 1994 "Wes Craven's New Nightmare," in which Englund also appeared as himself, you probably would.) The actor reflects on a career of playing more than just the murderous dream-invader. (June 6 on Screambox and other digital platforms )
SQUARING THE CIRCLE (THE STORY OF HIPGNOSIS) No stranger to album covers, the photographer and filmmaker Anton Corbijn (the Ian Curtis biopic "Control") directed this documentary about the British design firm responsible for some of the most famous record packaging ever devised. (June 7 in theaters)
THE ANGRY BLACK GIRL AND HER MONSTER When her brother is killed, a teenage scientist sets out to revivify him, "Frankenstein"-style. Laya DeLeon Hayes and Denzel Whitaker star. Bomani J. Story wrote and directed. (June 9 in theaters and on demand)
BLUE JEAN A gym teacher (Rosy McEwen) has to lead her romantic life on the sly against the backdrop of homophobic policies in Margaret Thatcher's Britain. Georgia Oakley directed. (June 9 in theaters)
DALÍLAND In the 1970s, a young man (Christopher Briney) gets a chance to tag along with the Surrealist genius and his upturned mustache, both of which are embodied by Ben Kingsley. Barbara Sukowa plays Dalí's wife. Mary Harron directed. (June 9 in theaters and on demand)
THE DOC The rapper and lyricist Tracy Curry, a.k.a. The D.O.C., is profiled in a film that includes interviews with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube. (June 9 in theaters)
FLAMIN' HOT Eva Longoria directed this film about Richard Montañez (Jesse Garcia), who claimed he created Cheetos Crunchy Flamin' Hots. (June 9 on Disney+ and Hulu)
MENDING THE LINE A returning veteran reacclimates to civilian life with assistance from a fly fisherman and a librarian. Brian Cox, Sinqua Walls and Wes Studi star. (June 9 in theaters)
PERSIAN LESSONS Vadim Perelman ("House of Sand and Fog") directed this World War II drama about a Belgian Jew (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart) who pretends to be Persian to escape execution, but then is assigned to teach the language to a German (Lars Eidinger). (June 9 in theaters)
SCARLET Pietro Marcello, whose "Martin Eden" was selected by Manohla Dargis as the best film of 2020, directed this fractured fairy tale about a returning World War I veteran and his daughter. Raphaël Thiéry and Juliette Jouan star. (June 9 in theaters)
TRANSFORMERS: RISE OF THE BEASTS What is the appropriate taxonomy for giant robots? The Maximals, who join the series, belong to a genus (or phylum, or order) that makes them look like they share an evolutionary link with King Kong or the apes of "Planet of the Apes." Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback supply the human presence. Steven Caple Jr. ("Creed II") directed. (June 9 in theaters)
ASTEROID CITY Wes Anderson ventures into the milieu of 1950s sci-fi: His latest film is set in a desert town during a convention of "junior stargazers and space cadets." The cast is ridiculously starry and too long to list, but it includes Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Wright and -- making his first appearance in the Anderson cosmos -- Tom Hanks. (June 16 in theaters)
THE BLACKENING A group of friends gather on Juneteenth at a cabin in the woods, where a villain who appears to be a graduate of the Jigsaw School of Torture forces them to play a racist board game with fatal stakes. Tim Story directed this horror spoof. Antoinette Robertson, Dewayne Perkins and Sinqua Walls star. (June 16 in theaters)
ELEMENTAL Pixar's latest creation is set in Element City, whose animated residents are each composed of one of four principal elements: water, fire, air or earth. Then a fire gal (voiced by Leah Lewis) meets a water dude (Mamoudou Athie). Peter Sohn ("The Good Dinosaur") directed. (June 16 in theaters)
EXTRACTION 2 There was a time, in the 1980s or '90s, when someone would have put a bit more effort into that title. Just imagine: "Another Extraction." "Re-Extracted." "Extraction 2: Extrusion." "After barely surviving the events of the first movie," per the official synopsis, the Australian mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) takes a crack at another rescue. Sam Hargrave directed from a screenplay by Joe Russo. (June 16 on Netflix)
THE FLASH "I completely broke the universe," Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) says in the trailer for the latest DC movie entry. Let's not catastrophize. There are salient questions surrounding this film. Will Miller's legal troubles dampen fans' enthusiasm? Will Michael Keaton, returning here as Batman more than 30 years after returning in "Batman Returns," still fit into his bat suit? (June 16 in theaters)
FREEDOM'S PATH During the Civil War, a Union soldier is taken in by a member of the underground railroad. RJ Cyler, Gerran Howell and Ewen Bremner star. (June 16 in theaters and on demand)
MAGGIE MOORE(S) Jon Hamm plays a police chief investigating why two women named Maggie Moore were both bumped off. Tina Fey also stars. Hamm's "Mad Men" foil, John Slattery, directed. (June 16 in theaters)
THE STROLL The directors Kristen Lovell and Zackary Drucker's documentary revisits the years when New York's meatpacking district was a place where transgender prostitutes could create a (relatively) safe space for one another.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The premiere of Dylan Mattingly and Thomas Bartscherer's six-hour opera was presented by the orchestra -- an institution at an inflection point.
The composer Dylan Mattingly's cheeks turned red, and he held a hand up to his eyes, as he began to cry late Saturday night during the bows for the world premiere of his opera "Stranger Love."
It was an understandably emotional moment. "Stranger Love," created with Thomas Bartscherer, had been in development for over a decade and performed piecemeal, but was now being presented in its entirety at Walt Disney Concert Hall, by the perhaps the only orchestra that could do it: the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
That's because "Stranger Love" is a six-hour, durational opera, an earnest exercise in deep feeling that takes sensations and stretches them from the personal to the cosmic, and goes big in a time when contemporary music tends to go small. It requires the kind of pipe-dream planning that many institutions shy away from, but that has been characteristic of the Philharmonic.
Characteristic in large part thanks to the work of Chad Smith, the orchestra's chief executive and one of its longtime administrators, who said last week that he would leave Los Angeles for the Boston Symphony Orchestra this fall. That news followed another recent blow: the announcement that the Philharmonic's superstar maestro, Gustavo Dudamel, would depart for New York in 2026.
The Los Angeles Philharmonic is now at an inflection point. At stake is the preservation of an ethos that has made this orchestra the kind that can throw its ambition, and deep pockets, into projects like John Cage's outrageous "Europeras" at Sony Studios; regular commissions at the length of symphonies and full evenings; and "Stranger Love," whose first act alone is as long as Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde" (also programmed there this season), but which doesn't have a fraction of its marketability.
So, as Mattingly cried onstage, his triumph felt bittersweet, with a tinge of fear about the Philharmonic's next phase. "Omnia mutantur," someone says in the opera, nodding to Ovid: Everything changes. Yet it's also natural to want more from the Smith-Dudamel era -- to "tarry a while" and "linger in this moment," to pull another line from the show.
No matter what happens, "Stranger Love" deserves life beyond its one-night-only run at Disney Hall, which was hosted by the Philharmonic and performed by Mattingly's ensemble, Contemporaneous. The most natural fit in New York, where epically avant-garde opera has all but vanished from earlier bastions like the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Lincoln Center, would be the Park Avenue Armory, the city's most generous promoter of large-scale work.
If anything, the Armory would be a more appropriate space than Disney Hall, its vastness able to accommodate Mattingly's musical and emotional sprawl -- the way his score does nothing but linger, luxuriating in the good and the bad, the spiritual and the doubtful, and above all the ecstatic.
Like most works of extreme ambition and magnitude, "Stranger Love" isn't perfect. When it name-checks the likes of Anne Carson and Octavio Paz, it behaves more like creative nonfiction than opera and yanks its audience from an experience of pure feeling. Some stretches of the score are more trying than transporting, and the second act seems destined to torment any director.
That 80-minute act -- in which singers exist more as instrumentalists than traditional characters -- certainly appears to have stumped Lileana Blain-Cruz, an imaginative, effective director who wasn't in full control of the material here, or much of elsewhere. There were references, in her modest staging, to the work's lineage of opera and durational art. In Matt Saunders's scenic design, a tall backdrop (made of threads that formed a canvas for Hanna Wasileski's projections) was at one point illuminated with Karl Friedrich Schinkel's celestial, forced-perspective set for "The Magic Flute." As if playing off an "Einstein on the Beach" reference in the line "These are the days my friends," Blain-Cruz has two people carry and sit in chairs that could have been used in Robert Wilson's original "Einstein" production.
That's far from the only tip of the hat in "Stranger Love," but it may be the most explicit. Mattingly has internalized a wealth of musical styles: the gamelan-influenced, West Coast sounds of Lou Harrison; the propulsive cadences of John Adams; the vocal technique and poetic dramaturgy of Meredith Monk. Three female voices -- Holly Sedillos, Catherine Brookman and Eliza Bagg, often employing woodwind-like vocalise -- could have been pulled from a Minimalist ensemble.
But Mattingly doesn't quote. Instead, his influences surface subtly, abstracted in, say, a rhythmic gesture. In the end, the language is entirely his own. Although his score often instructs singers to "sound as beautiful as possible," his writing calls for the directness of pop rather than an operatic color. His 28-piece orchestra includes restless percussion and three pianos: one with standard tuning, one roughly half a tone lower, the other in between. The microtonal effect, in Mattingly's polyrhythms, can be that of a gently melodic choir of wind chimes.
In each scene, Mattingly prolongs a musical idea with mantra-like focus, relishing and delicately transforming it. Bartscherer's poetic and slim story follows a couple, Tasha and Andre, through the seasons, a vague timeline guided more by mood than chronology: fresh, promising spring; pleasantly lethargic summer; suddenly shifting autumn; suffocatingly glacial winter. This general arc is narrated by Uriel -- a charismatic Julyana Soelistyo, whose otherworldliness is emphasized in Kaye Voyce's costume design -- and accompanied by two allegorical figures, Threat from Without (temptation) and Threat from Within (doubt).
David Bloom conducted Mattingly's pitfall-ridden score with a sure hand. Occasionally, his hips betrayed an urge to groove, but even then he remained unflappably precise. As Andre, the tenor Isaiah Robinson had a bright purity that served the score with an egoless instrumental timbre similar to the soprano Molly Netter's Tasha. As the Threat from Without, Jane Sheldon sang with birdlike leaps redolent of Monk's "Atlas"; Luc Kleiner, as the Threat from Within, was gloomier and darkly seductive.
Blain-Cruz's production featured six dancers, who during the first act are made to behave with unpredictably fast and slow stylized movement that snaps into focus only when Tasha and Andre spot each other and sustain eye contact from across the stage. But in the second act, the dancers merely retell the lovers' story through Chris Emile's tiresomely obvious choreography.
Most impressive were the members of Contemporaneous, which Mattingly founded with Bloom while students at Bard College. These are players well versed in Mattingly's idiom, and well suited to take on such an immense, difficult score for one night: exact and detailed, but also lively and openly dancing, as full of personality as any singer.
They are the stars of the purely instrumental third act, repeating versions of earworm phrases for about 20 minutes. As the score ritualistically stretches a kind of communal love to the cosmos, one melody begins to spread out as well, until, in the final seconds, it unfurls slowly, ending before it reaches its last note.
And why should it? When something is this special, you can't help but want to tarry a while and linger in the moment.

Full text: In "Strange Way of Life," the director's short western, Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal play a lawman and a cowboy looking back on a passionate affair.
Follow our live updates from the opening night of the Cannes Film Festival.
The gunslinger in green locks eyes with the sheriff.
"Don't look at me like that," says the sheriff, squinting.
"How do you want me to look at you?" replies the gunslinger, flirting.
It wouldn't be a western without a fraught standoff, but when Pedro Almodóvar is behind the camera, the glances are even more loaded than the pistols. In "Strange Way of Life," a new short film that will premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday, Ethan Hawke and Pedro Pascal star as a lawman and a cowboy who reunite 25 years after having a passionate affair. But will their old magic be rekindled, or are both men concealing ulterior motives for the meeting?
In many ways, the project is a swerve for Almodóvar: The 73-year-old auteur, typically known for Spanish-language movies about modern women living in beautiful apartments, has cast two English-speaking actors in a short that is set in the dusty Wild West. But Almodóvar, who was courted two decades ago to direct the gay western "Brokeback Mountain" and turned it down, sees his new project on a continuum with that 2005 film, which was ultimately directed by Ang Lee, who went on to win best director.
"In 'Brokeback Mountain,' Jake Gyllenhaal's character says to Heath Ledger's character that they should go away and work on a ranch," Almodóvar said on a video call. "Heath says, 'What would two men do in the West, working on a ranch?' In many ways, I feel my film gives answer to that."
Almodóvar wrote a few pages of the centerpiece scene three years ago, then put it out of his mind. "Sometimes I just write for the pleasure of writing," he said. "I didn't have any purpose for it." But inspiration struck when Anthony Vaccarello, the creative director of the fashion label Saint Laurent, mentioned that he had just produced a short film for Gaspar Noé. Almodóvar remembered the sequence with the two pistoleros, added a scene-setting prologue and a guns-out aftermath, and offered Vaccarrello the screenplay for the 31-minute "Strange Way of Life."
"Of course, it could have become a feature-length film," he said. "But I do think it was the perfect duration for the story I want to tell." And after making the short film "The Human Voice" in 2020 with Tilda Swinton, Almodóvar hoped to continue casting English-speaking stars. "I never wanted to do it in Spanish," Almodóvar said. "Even though we have our own western type, the spaghetti western, I wanted to make it a classic western."
Almodóvar soon reached out to Pascal, whose star was beginning to rise with the series "The Mandalorian" and "The Last of Us." The 48-year-old actor was eager to sign on; he had watched his first Almodóvar film, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" (1988), with his family as a young teenager.
"I remember it feeling like going to a new amusement park," Pascal said in an email. "An entire world of color and play and a kind of naughty rebelión was introduced to my experience."
His co-star was just as gung-ho. "I felt really honored to be an American actor that was getting to work with him," Hawke said by phone. "A lot of times when you're making mainstream American movies, there's this third entity in the room, which is you want the movie to sell -- you just feel it from people behind the monitor. And what's so wonderful about working with Almodóvar is that you feel there is nobody you need to make happy but Pedro Almodóvar."
The short went into production last summer in Almería, Spain, on the outdoor sets where Sergio Leone once shot his classic 1964-66 trilogy of spaghetti westerns starring Clint Eastwood. "The passing of time, 50 years of it, had given authenticity to the place," Almodóvar said. And in addition to producing the project, Vaccarello doubled as its costume designer, a crucial post on an Almodóvar film.
"There's some directors I've worked with who are wonderful directors, but they're just not that interested in costume -- it's just, 'Yeah, whatever you want to wear is fine,"' Hawke said. "Whereas Almodóvar would spend weeks deciding what shade of green the wall is behind you or what color gray your jacket is and what fabric it's made out of."
Though Almodóvar's films are also notable for what happens when those clothes come off, "Strange Way of Life" is surprisingly discreet, fading to black when Hawke and Pascal move in for an embrace.
"The sexual tension in my film happens around the gazes, so from the very beginning, I decided I wasn't going to show the entirety of the sexual scene," Almodóvar said. "They're way more naked in the conversation they have after."
It's that conversation that made Almodóvar want to shoot the film in the first place: After making "Pain and Glory" (2019), which starred Antonio Banderas as a thinly veiled version of his director, Almodóvar has found himself increasingly drawn to stories about middle-aged gay men looking back at their lives.
"I do think this is partly a reflection of my own age, that I've decided to tell stories about older men," Almodóvar said. "If I had written these stories when I was 25 years old, I probably would have written a story about two 25-year-old cowboys."
The shoot wasn't easy, Hawke admitted: The production had to battle a record heat wave over 15 days in the desert, "and it's very difficult to think about nuanced ideas when all your body wants to do is go to sleep or find some air conditioning," he said. But as the project drew to a close, he was able to step back and take it all in.
"All of a sudden I wrapped and realized that I was in the desert in Spain on an old Sergio Leone set, and Almodóvar was hugging me, thanking me, and I just thought about how much I love the movies and what a unique challenge this was and how much I keep wanting to hunt these kinds of experiences out," Hawke said. "I felt somehow better for having done it, and I don't know how to say it other than that."

E.U. Clears Acquisition Of Activision: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The green light follows objections to the blockbuster deal by American and British regulators on the grounds that it would undercut competition.
Microsoft's faltering $ 69 billion bid to buy the video game company Activision Blizzard received a glimmer of hope on Monday when European Union regulators approved what would be the largest consumer tech deal in two decades.
E.U. officials said they would allow the deal after Microsoft, the maker of the Xbox console, made concessions to ensure that rival companies of new online gaming services would have continued access to titles developed by Activision, such as the hugely popular Call of Duty.
Even so, the blockbuster acquisition, which has become a test of whether regulators around the world will approve a tech megamerger amid concerns about the industry's power, still faces an uphill climb. American and British regulators have each moved to stop the acquisition in recent months, arguing that a combination of the Xbox maker with the company behind the Call of Duty franchise would hinder competition. Microsoft is fighting both actions.
The deal has revealed fractures among regulators about how to crimp the power of the world's biggest technology companies.
Opposition to the acquisition has centered in part on so-called cloud gaming, a relatively new technology that lets people stream games on phones, tablets and other devices, potentially eliminating the need for hardware like consoles. American and British regulators said Microsoft's purchase of Activision would undercut this still-developing sector of the gaming industry before it had a chance to bloom. The European Commission, the executive body for the 27-nation bloc, gave its approval after Microsoft agreed to guarantee for 10 years that gamers would be able to play Activision titles on cloud gaming services being developed by other companies, such as Nvidia.
After negotiating the concessions with Microsoft, European Union officials said they concluded that the deal could go through, particularly because the cloud gaming market was still so small. Many Activision titles that are not currently playable on smaller cloud gaming services would now be available, providing a consumer boost for the new technology, the regulators said.
"These commitments fully address the competition concerns identified by the commission and represent a significant improvement for cloud game streaming compared to the current situation," the E.U. regulator said in a statement.
Microsoft said the concessions would benefit consumers.
"The European Commission has required Microsoft to license popular Activision Blizzard games automatically to competing cloud gaming services," said Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft. "This will apply globally and will empower millions of consumers worldwide to play these games on any device they choose."
The European Commission said the deal would not harm the console market because Microsoft would not have an incentive to deny rivals, such as the Sony PlayStation, access to Activision titles without sacrificing profit. In the European Union, PlayStation has a much larger market share than Xbox.
The deal shows the difficulty of reaching a global consensus to regulate an evolving technology industry. While policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have expressed concern about the growing power of the tech industry, differences remain about when and how to intervene.
The approval on Monday is a rare occasion where European regulators appear to be more accommodating than the United States. For years, European antitrust regulators, under Margrethe Vestager, have aggressively gone after big tech companies such as Google, issuing billions of dollars of fines and ordering changes to certain business practices. An E.U. new law taking effect by next year will add further competition oversight of the biggest tech firms.
But in this instance it is the United States taking the tougher position. Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, has made the challenging of mergers a central part of her plan to rein in the tech giants. The F.T.C. sued to block Microsoft's purchase of Activision in December, arguing that the deal would harm consumers and lure gamers away from rivals. British regulators followed suit last month, rejecting the acquisition because of concerns about harming the cloud gaming market.
Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of Britain's antitrust regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, said the decision reached by the European Commission gives Microsoft too much power to set the terms and conditions for the cloud gaming market for the next decade.
"While we recognize and respect that the European Commission is entitled to take a different view, the C.M.A. stands by its decision," Ms. Cardell said in a statement.
An F.T.C. spokesman declined to comment.
Approval in Brussels sets up a complicated legal chessboard for Microsoft and Activision, with few moves left to play. The fate of the deal will now hang largely on the legal process in the United States and Britain.
The two companies must show that the deal would not constrain competition, particularly if Microsoft would guarantee access to Activision titles. While American courts have shown they can be more open to overruling government antitrust initiatives, in Britain it is less common for verdicts by the Competition and Markets Authority to be reversed.
A loss in either country could be fatal for the deal because of the globalized and interconnected nature of the video game industry and the technology it uses.

Going to Bat For a Rare Gem In the Majors: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: A new documentary argues that the Yankee catcher was not just a malaprop-prone, beloved celebrity but also a legend of the game.
In the latest edition of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, there's a sports figure who towers over the competition.
Among the nine sayings attributed to one Lawrence Peter Berra, the New York Yankees catcher better known as Yogi, are phrases that may seem nonsensical at first, but on further reflection offer wisdom for the ages.
"You can observe a lot by watching."
"It was déjà vu all over again."
And of course, there's "It ain't over till it's over," which provides the title for a new documentary about Yogi's life.
"It Ain't Over" aims to be a corrective to the caricature implanted in the cultural consciousness of Yogi as an amiable clown, a malaprop-prone catcher who looked as if he were put together with spare parts. But Yogi was not only a cuddly pitchman for insurance, beer and chocolate milk, an inspiration for a certain cartoon bear, and a stand-up guy beloved by teammates; he was, the film argues, one of the best baseball players who ever lived.
"This guy was criminally overlooked his whole life, at every stage," said Sean Mullin, the film's director.
The documentary, which opens Friday, is intensely personal, tapping the eldest of Yogi's 11 grandchildren to serve as a narrator with no pretense to objectivity in fighting for her grandfather's legacy.
It was a relatively recent slight that encapsulates the film's defining thesis and yields the opening scene. During the All-Star Game in 2015, Major League Baseball honored the four players voted by fans as the greatest living legends. Watching that night with her grandfather, Lindsay Berra remembers becoming infuriated that Yogi had not made the cut.
Mullin and Lindsay Berra, in separate interviews, emphasized that they meant no offense to the four greats honored that night -- Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Sandy Koufax and Johnny Bench. They just fervently believe that Yogi should have been the fifth man walking on the field that night in Cincinnati.
"I always thought from the beginning that I figuratively wanted to put Grandpa back in the picture with the documentary," said Lindsay Berra, who is an executive producer on the film.
The filmmakers marshal the statistics and an impressive array of former players and other baseball experts to back up their claim. Yogi -- who died in 2015 at 90 -- was a core part of 10 World Series championship teams as a player, more than anyone else. He won three Most Valuable Player awards, played in All-Star games in 15 straight years and in 1956 caught the only perfect game in World Series history. And only two major leaguers have ever hit more than 350 home runs while striking out fewer than 450 times: Joe DiMaggio and Yogi.
The statistic that most impresses Lindsay Berra comes from 1950. That season, Yogi went to the plate 656 times and struck out just 12 times: "That to me will always be astonishing, because guys today strike out 12 times in a weekend."
All this passionate lobbying is not mere special familial pleading. Jon Pessah, who wrote the 2020 biography "Yogi: A Life Behind the Mask" (and is not in the film), said the idea that Yogi's baseball prowess has been overlooked "is 100 percent true."
Besides the hitting feats, Yogi willed himself into becoming a terrific defensive catcher and was expert at guiding his temperamental pitchers. (During Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, he did not shake off one of the 97 pitches Yogi called.)
"After studying his career, you say, wow, this guy carried the Yankees in the '50s," a decade that bridged DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle, Pessah said. "You look at what he meant on the field and at the plate, he was a force."
The unfair, and incomplete, perception of Yogi has much to do with his stubby stature and comparisons with his famous teammates. DiMaggio was slick and polished, and married to Marilyn Monroe; Mantle was the blue-eyed, golden-haired, all-American boy from Oklahoma. Yogi -- well, no demeaning or belittling description seemed off-limits to the writers who covered him. Early in his career, a Life magazine article referred to him as "knock-kneed" and "barrel-shaped," and likened his running style to that of "a fat girl in a tight skirt." That was all in one sentence.
His first manager called him an ape. In newspaper and magazine articles, Yogi's looks were compared to those of a gargoyle, a gorilla and an orangutan.
"Can you imagine reporters writing today that someone looked like a gorilla and was too ugly to be a Yankee?" Lindsay Berra said.
But Yogi ultimately didn't mind playing the butt of jokes, sloughing them off as just another test of character.
"I think he knew inside who he was," Mullin said. "There was a real confidence at a very base level."
Growing up the fourth child of Italian immigrants in St. Louis, Yogi quit school after eighth grade to help support his family, although he pretty much just wanted to play baseball. Constantly underestimated, he ultimately signed with the Yankees. He served during World War II and was in a rocket boat at Omaha Beach on D-Day.
Back from the war, he played on a Yankees farm team for a year before being called up late in the 1946 season. He was in the majors for good.
While proving naysayers wrong with his hitting prowess and improving defense, he also displayed deep-seated integrity. At a time when racism still thrived in Major League Baseball despite Jackie Robinson integrating the game in 1947, Yogi showed respect to Robinson and other Black players; he later became very good friends with Larry Doby, the first Black player in the American League.
But a charmed life -- he also had a storybook marriage to his hometown sweetheart, Carmen -- does not make for the most dramatic of films.
To add some texture to his portrait, Mullin examined both Yogi's larger cultural significance and his personal pain.
Yogi became one of the first celebrity endorsers, hawking the chocolate milk drink Yoo Hoo, Doodle fish oil, Camel cigarettes and, really leaning into the persona later in life, Miller Lite and Aflac insurance. "He never resented the way he was viewed but he was savvy enough to know it made business sense," Pessah said.
Yogi's son Dale followed him into the majors, but a promising career was derailed by a cocaine addiction. Rehab didn't help, and neither did encouragement from his family. It took an ultimatum, delivered by Yogi, at an intervention in 1992.
"You're not going to be my son anymore unless you make a decision to not do drugs again," Dale Berra said his father told him. He has been clean since.
The other deep wound in Yogi's life came in 1985, inflicted by the Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. Serving as manager for Steinbrenner was a decidedly unsafe proposition, and 16 games into Yogi's second season, he was fired. What angered Yogi most wasn't the firing, it was that Steinbrenner didn't have the guts (or decency) to deliver the blow himself. Yogi, always a man of his word, vowed never to return to Yankee Stadium until Steinbrenner apologized.
It took nearly 14 years before a rapprochement was brokered, leading to Yogi Berra Day at the stadium in July 1999. Forty-three years after the World Series perfect game, Don Larsen was reunited with his former battery mate to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.
Yogi didn't have a glove with him, so he borrowed one from Joe Girardi, a Yankees catcher at the time. Those there that day still marvel at what they then witnessed. David Cone proceeded to pitch another perfect game for the Yankees. A life well lived had its magical coda.

U.F.O. Podcast Feeds On Success: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Tenderfoot TV, the studio behind "High Strange," is leaning in while others pull back.
The biggest flex in "High Strange," Donald Albright and Payne Lindsey's hit podcast about U.F.O.s and supposed alien encounters, comes during the end credits. A person is describing stumbling upon a flying saucer in the woods or chasing a glowing red orb past a farm when the music fades in -- an eerie trickle of high-pitched percussion, the slow march of minor piano, the spectral voice of the rapper Gunna floating in at a half whisper.
"Bought a spaceship now I'm a space cadet/Big white mansion is my habitat."
They don't play this on "Unsolved Mysteries."
The credits song, "Space Cadet," from an album by the producer Metro Boomin, doubles as a neon billboard for Tenderfoot TV, the podcast and multimedia company founded by Lindsey and Albright in 2016. It's both flashy -- clearing the copyrights took around nine months and $ 50,000 -- and purposeful, speaking in the idiom of the youthful, culturally omnivorous listeners around which Tenderfoot hopes to build a new-media powerhouse.
Since the success of its first series, "Up and Vanished," a true crime investigation that has been downloaded 300 million times, Tenderfoot has grown into a formidable producer of investigative and documentary podcasts, including "Atlanta Monster," "To Live and Die in LA" and, last year, "Kim Kardashian's The System," hosted by Kardashian. After its debut last month, "High Strange" spent two weeks in the top 5 on Apple Podcasts' Top Shows chart, peaking at No. 2; the company says it has since averaged around 300,000 downloads per episode, the most of any of its shows outside the true crime category.
At a time when a turbulent economy has many podcast companies cutting costs and laying off workers, Tenderfoot has nearly doubled its small staff in the past year, from 9 to 17 employees. Albright and Lindsey, who jointly own the company, said Tenderfoot has been turning a profit since 2017 and is on track to exceed $ 10 million in revenue this year. With "High Strange" -- and seven other shows in production -- the company is among a handful of independent studios hoping to successfully navigate podcasting's next frontier.
"All the success we've had up to this point is the launching pad for what we're about to do next," said Albright, in a recent joint video interview with Lindsey from Tenderfoot's office in Atlanta. "Weekly shows, daily shows, limited series, subscriptions, television -- if we can win a little bit here and a little bit there, we win overall."
Albright, who moved to Atlanta from the Bay Area in 1997, and Lindsey, who grew up in the city, are both veterans of the local music industry, a past that informs creative and business thinking at Tenderfoot. (Metro Boomin and Gunna are hometown favorites.) They met in 2012, when Lindsey, at the time a singer-songwriter turned music video director, sent Albright an email looking for work. Albright, who was helping run a company that managed the R&B singers Lloyd and August Alsina, took a chance on Lindsey, paying the novice $ 2,000 to direct a music video for Alsina that went on to surpass 30 million views on YouTube. More videos and a tour documentary followed, and a partnership was born.
"We were together on a world tour, up late nights on the bus and talking about different dreams that we had," said Lindsey, 35. "I always knew that if I ever started my own venture, I would want Donald to be a part of it."
A few years later, while looking to branch out from video directing work, Lindsey found himself obsessing over true crime documentaries. HBO's "The Jinx," Netflix's "Making a Murderer" and the podcast "Serial" had inspired a surge of interest in the genre. He decided to try his hand at making his own, this time presenting Albright with a job offer.
Tenderfoot grew out of "Up and Vanished," which chronicled Lindsey's overtly amateurish but sincere attempt to shed light on the unsolved disappearance in 2005 of a schoolteacher in Georgia. The podcast went viral in 2017, midway through the first season, after the Georgia Bureau of Investigation charged a suspect with murder and a man alleged to be his accomplice with attempting to conceal a death. A spokesman for the bureau said renewed news media attention played a significant role in instigating the arrests. (Ryan Duke was later found not guilty of murder but convicted of concealing a death, as was the accomplice, Bo Dukes). Up to that point, "Up and Vanished" had been downloaded 10 million times over six months. Within a month of the arrests, it received another 10 million downloads.
"People connected with Payne because he was just like the listener," Albright, 46, said. "He wasn't pretending to be a seasoned investigator or lawyer or anything like that. He wasn't even really a podcaster. But people saw themselves in him. That gave us a blueprint."
The name Tenderfoot, among the lowest ranks in Boy Scouts, is a nod to the company's populist ethos. Lindsey and Albright initially planned to pivot to television documentaries and film (hence the "TV") but stayed the course in podcasting after the success of "Up and Vanished."
Tenderfoot has since produced more than two dozen podcasts, the majority of which have a true crime focus. The company has thrived in part through strategic partnerships. "Up and Vanished," which has published four seasons tracking various cold cases, and "High Strange" are distributed and sold to advertisers by the Audacy-owned podcast company Cadence13, with which Tenderfoot has a first-look deal. The company has a separate arrangement with iHeartMedia for "Atlanta Monster," two spinoff series and other shows. And it has created original series for HBO, Netflix and Audible.
In 2021, Courtney Holt, the former head of studios and video at Spotify, tapped the company to produce a show about a man convicted in 1998 of a triple homicide. Kim Kardashian, with whom Spotify had signed a high-profile exclusive contract, and who has a history of involvement with criminal justice causes, would be the host.
"I had been a fan of their work just as a consumer," Holt said of the Tenderfoot duo. "They had a really interesting way of telling stories about dark subject matter that pulls you in and takes you on a journey."
Also that year, Tenderfoot launched a premium subscription membership through Apple Podcasts, Tenderfoot+. For $ 4.99 per month, members get early access to the full season of "High Strange," ad-free versions of podcasts, bonus content and other perks. Paid subscriptions, enabled by both Apple and Spotify in 2021, are still a relatively small slice of the industry but have gained traction alongside popular content monetization platforms like Patreon and Substack. Tenderfoot+ is a key plank of the company's strategy to weather a down advertising market and -- along with Wondery, NBC's Dateline and Sony Music's The Binge -- is one of the top 5 subscriber channels on Apple Podcasts with 15,000 to 20,000 subscribers.
"If the ad market is down, no one wants to release a project," Albright said. "But if you have a direct relationship with your audience through subscriptions, then we can put things out whenever we want and still be able to recoup our money."
With "High Strange," the company took its biggest step yet away from the reliable true crime space. The show, which cost over $ 500,000, was partly inspired by "Radio Rental," a Tenderfoot podcast hosted by the actor Rainn Wilson and featuring stories of strange and purportedly supernatural encounters told in the first person. Lindsey, a lifelong fan of "Unsolved Mysteries," launched the show with Wilson in 2019. In 2021, amid renewed interest in U.F.O.s -- following the Pentagon's release of a report saying it couldn't rule out the possibility of extraterrestrial visitation -- Lindsey had the idea for a podcast that would blend the investigative approach of "Up and Vanished" with the odder tone of "Radio Rental."
"I wanted to do the non-U.F.O. U.F.O. podcast," Lindsey said. "I don't know what's out there -- no one does -- but people can hear the evidence and make up their own mind."
Over the course of the season, the show has walked the line between the sober (scientists on the statistical likelihood of extraterrestrial life) and the eccentric (an interview with a man who says he was abducted by a flying saucer in the 1970s). Its popularity has emboldened the creators to apply their investigative lens more broadly, including with a planned series that will address a new unsolved mystery each week.
"We just want to keep finding great stories and see where they take us," Albright said. "As long as we're doing that, we'll end up in a good position."

Full text: CRIMINAL JUSTICE
U.K. Tech Entrepreneur Is Extradited to the U.S.
Mike Lynch, co-founder of U.K. software firm Autonomy, has been extradited to the United States to face criminal charges in a near decade-long legal battle and fall from grace for a man once hailed as Britain's answer to Bill Gates.
Mr. Lynch, 57, faces 17 charges over Hewlett-Packard's $ 11 billion acquisition of Autonomy, the company he grew into Britain's leading tech company, before it spectacularly unraveled after the transaction in 2011.
Appearing in court on Thursday, Mr. Lynch, who could face 20 years in prison, was ordered by a judge to pay a $ 100 million bond, hand over his passport and to be placed under 24 hour guard to secure his release.
Once lauded by academics, scientists and politicians for setting up a software giant from his groundbreaking research at Cambridge University, he has spent the last decade fighting lawsuits related to the HP takeover.
The charges Mr. Lynch faces in the U.S. are for wire and securities fraud. REUTERS
LABOR
German Railway Union Plans 50-Hour Walk Out
A labor union representing more than 200,000 German railway workers said on Friday that it was going ahead with a planned strike next week after its demands for better pay were rejected by employers.
The EVG union said its members will walk out for 50 hours from late Sunday until late Tuesday. The rail company Deutsche Bahn has canceled all long-distance travel during that period and warned that most regional trains also won't run.
The strike will likely be one of the biggest in recent years, following a previous large-scale walkout in April. But union co-leader Cosima Ingenschay said that a strike could still be averted at the last minute if employers put forward another offer.
EVG went into the current round of pay negotiations seeking a raise of 12 percent for its members, or at least 650 euros more each month. It also wants the minimum wage of 12 euros an hour to be ensured through basic pay rather than with bonuses, as is currently the case for some 2,700 workers.
The strike will affect dozens of rail companies as well as freight traffic. ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAX INCENTIVES
Nevada Bill Would Bring Film Production to Vegas
A bipartisan group of Nevada lawmakers introduced a bill on Thursday that would give massive tax credits aimed at bringing film production to southern Nevada, including a $ 1 billion Sony expansion. It's the latest attempt at diversifying southern Nevada's gaming and tourism-reliant economy, which was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
The $ 190 million in annual tax credits for 20 years would be the largest proposed tax incentive package in recent state history.
The legislation would involve the state entering an agreement with private developers who would pay for two film production sites.
"It creates a whole new industry in Nevada," the bill's sponsor, State Sen. Roberta Lange of Las Vegas, a Democrat, said in an interview Thursday. "I think it helps build and diversify our economy, which is something we've talked about in Nevada for as long as I've lived here." ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: Recent international series of note include "A Spy Among Friends" on MGM+ and "Sam: A Saxon" on Hulu.
It has been a quiet season for international television on American screens -- nothing has grabbed attention on a "Squid Game" or "Downton Abbey" scale. But barely a day goes by, in the streaming age, without an interesting series washing up from some foreign shore. Here are four recent shows worth tracking down, from an elegant British thriller to a Chinese dramedy about a demon god and an immortal warrior who meet cute on the mortal plane.
'A Spy Among Friends'
Alexander Cary, a writer and executive producer on "Homeland," wrote this six-episode spy thriller as a leisurely, literate, three- or four-dimensional game of chess. Based on the nonfiction book of the same name by Ben Macintyre, it tells the story of Kim Philby (and the other high-level Soviet spies known as the Cambridge Five) by focusing on a set of intertwined sparring matches: Philby's with his friend and MI6 colleague Nicholas Elliott, sent to Beirut to bring the disgraced Philby home; Elliott's with a (fictional) agent, Lily Thomas, assigned to interrogate him when he returns to London alone; and Elliott and Thomas's with the MI6 hierarchy once he brings her around to his side.
Made for the British streaming service ITVX and available here on MGM+ and Prime Video, "A Spy Among Friends" is smart, complicated (at times overly so) and saturated in a particular Cold War blend of tragic romanticism and kitchen-sink class politics. What makes it stand out, though, is its casting. Anna Maxwell Martin and Guy Pearce are excellent as Thomas and Philby, and Damian Lewis is outstanding as Elliott, the colorless spy's spy whose skills and motives are in question until the end. Tightly controlled yet somehow relaxed, Lewis gives a performance in which the coldblooded manipulator and the sentimentally loyal bro coexist at every moment.
'Sam: A Saxon'
As triumph-of-the-spirit stories go, "Sam: A Saxon" is notably low on triumph. Sam Meffire, the subject of this German biographical mini-series from Hulu, grew up in Dresden, both acutely aware of how his skin color set him apart and fiercely loyal to his East German homeland; shortly before the Berlin Wall fell, he became the country's first policeman of African descent. His life since then -- he's only 52 -- has been a carnival ride that no screenwriter would be likely to dream up: first a poster boy in a national ad campaign designed to humanize the police, and then a fugitive fleeing to Africa to avoid arrest for armed robbery.
Jörg Winger, a creator and the showrunner of "Sam," was also a creator of "Deutschland 83" and its sequels, and the shows share a knack for embedding engaging characters in real-world events in a way that feels both credible and suspenseful. In this dramatized telling, Meffire, played by the imposing actor Malick Bauer, is a true believer who finds himself continually and perversely acted upon by history. He is tossed about by the fall of Communism, and by the ravages of capitalism, racist nationalism and crime that the collapse unleashes. "Sam: A Saxon" stands firm against streaming-video bloat: Its seven episodes barely contain the story it sets out to tell.
'Skip and Loafer'
This sweet, lightly sentimental slice-of-life anime, halfway through its 12-episode season on Crunchyroll (and available for purchase on Prime Video), is an example of something that Japanese animation provides more consistently than American live-action TV: a comic, even expressionistic depiction of high-school life that still feels unforced and natural. Mitsumi, the star student of her small seaside town, moves to Tokyo to attend an elite prep school. Ferociously single-minded, very impressed with herself and determined to take her new school by storm, she's also a quick-to-embarrass country bumpkin, a classic setup for teenage comedy.
An early scene of Mitsumi's childhood friends chasing after her departing train is a ruse, a poke at the conventions of this sort of story in traditional anime and Studio Ghibli-style films. And the bending of perspectives continues: While Mitsumi runs a gantlet of welcoming ceremonies, classroom presentations and karaoke parties in Tokyo, we and everyone around her -- new friends, old friends and family -- can see the anxieties and mortifications that she thinks she is hiding. The show (whose cryptic title, taken from the manga on which the anime is based, probably alludes to Mitsumi and her slacker crush, Sousuke) is a lighthearted essay on loneliness and the life-or-death nature of every decision a 15-year-old makes.
'Till the End of the Moon'
While a demon god is in the process of destroying the world, the resolute mystical warrior Li Susu (Bai Lu) is sent back in time 500 years to find the demon while he is still in mortal form and kill him. Arriving in the kingdom of Sheng, she discovers that she is in the body of a headstrong, very poorly behaved princess who is married to -- do I have to spell it out?
"Till the End of the Moon," which is 35 episodes into its 40-episode run on Rakuten Viki, was a major hit in China, where it wrapped up this week; its premiere reportedly drew the highest numbers in three years for a xianxia (immortal heroes) drama. It's an excellent example of the Chinese streaming-video industry's capacity for making slickly disposable, highly enjoyable entertainment that combines elements of costume drama and special-effects-laden fantasy action with a healthy portion of romantic comedy. The humor will largely translate for a Western viewer, and Luo Yunxi ("My Sunshine," "Ashes of Love"), who plays both the annihilating god and the possibly sympathetic human prince, is a hypnotic camera subject.

Refashioning Hearing Aids: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ayla Wing's middle school students don't always know what to make of their 26-year-old teacher's hearing aids. The most common response she hears: "Oh, my grandma has them, too."
But grandma's hearing aids were never like this: Bluetooth-enabled and connected to her phone, they allow Ms. Wing to toggle with one touch between custom settings. She can shut out the world during a screeching subway ride, hear her friends in noisy bars during a night out and even understand her students better by switching to "mumbly kids."
A raft of new hearing aids have hit the market in recent years, offering greater appeal to a generation of young adults that some experts say is both developing hearing problems earlier in life and -- perhaps paradoxically -- becoming more comfortable with an expensive piece of technology pumping sound into their ears.
Some of the new models, including Ms. Wing's, are made by traditional prescription brands, which usually require a visit to a specialist. But the Food and Drug Administration opened up the market last year when it allowed the sale of hearing aids over the counter. In response, brand names like Sony and Jabra began releasing their own products, adding to the new wave of designs and features that appeal to young consumers.
"These new hearing aids are sexy," said Pete Bilzerian, a 25-year-old in Richmond, Va., who has worn the devices since he was 7. He describes his early models as distinctly unsexy: "big, funky, tan-colored hearing aids with the molding that goes all around the ear." But increasingly, those have given way to sleeker, smaller models with more technological capabilities.
Nowadays, he said, no one seems to notice the electronics in his ear. "If it ever does come up as a topic, I just brush it off and say, 'Hey, I got these very expensive AirPods."'
More people in Mr. Bilzerian's age group might need the equivalent of expensive AirPods, experts say. By the time they turn 30, about a fifth of Americans today have had their hearing damaged by noise, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently estimated. This number adds to the already substantial population of young people with hearing loss tied to genetics or medical conditions.
The exact number of young adults who need or use hearing aids is difficult to pinpoint, but both device manufacturers and medical experts say that population is growing. The leading prescription aid manufacturer, Phonak, says the number of Americans between the ages of 22 and 54 who have been fitted with the company's hearing aids increased by 14 percent more than the increase for users of all other ages between 2017 and 2021.
"Anecdotally, we have seen more young people over the past decade pursuing hearing protection. This seems to be much more mainstream, which is great," said Dr. Catherine V. Palmer, director of Audiology and Hearing Aids at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Children's Hospital.
Experts say there are several reasons that hearing aids are closing the generation gap. Attitudes have changed as technology has advanced, leading more young people to be willing to give them a try. And a growing number of 20-somethings may need them as they navigate an increasingly noise-soaked world; more than a billion young people worldwide risk noise-induced hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization.
But there are still significant barriers: Hearing aids are expensive -- especially for people who lack good medical insurance -- with most costing $ 1,000 or more. And the options can be confusing and difficult to navigate; many models still have to be prescribed by an audiologist. And while the stigma might be fading, it has not entirely vanished.
Data collected in 1989 by MarkeTrak, a consumer research organization that is part of the Hearing Industries of America, suggested that people who wore hearing aids "were perceived to be less competent, less attractive, less youthful and more disabled." Today, though, the organization said in a recent report, hearing aid users "rarely or never feel embarrassed or rejected."
While the emergence of over-the-counter hearing aids has provided new options, it has also made diving into the market more complicated. There are dozens of brands to choose from, ranging from small, in-ear pods to those that use long metallic arcs around the ear. Most new models have Bluetooth streaming capacities. And some of the over-the-counter options can even be ordered online with free shipping.
Blake Cadwell created Soundly, a website that allows users to compare hearing aid brands and prices, after trying to navigate the complex market himself.
"When I started the process, the main thing I experienced was it's difficult to know where to start and how to start, just figuring out which way was up," said Mr. Cadwell, 32, who lives in Los Angeles.
Even just getting a diagnosis for hearing loss can be hard. People who are concerned about their hearing might start at an ear, nose and throat specialist, and many are referred to audiologists or hearing clinics, where they face a mix of hearing tests, physical exams or imaging.
Juliann Zhou, a 22-year-old international student at New York University, was motivated to get her ears checked after being disturbed by an intense ringing, which was diagnosed as tinnitus from moderate hearing loss. Still, she has not been sold on hearing aids. An audiologist in the United States recommended them, but her parents and their family doctor in China told her they were "only for old people."
"I just don't know if it's necessary," she said.
Ms. Zhou says she "probably listened to music too loud," causing her hearing issues. That's an increasingly common concern, according to the Hearing Loss Association, which has called noise-induced hearing loss a growing public health crisis.
Though long-term tracking data is not available, the association estimates that 12.5 percent of Americans between the ages of 6 and 19 have hearing loss as a result of listening to loud music, particularly through earbuds at unsafe volumes.
For those who need them, the new wave of over-the-counter aids can be more affordable than many prescription models. That makes them a good first choice for more young people, said Zina Jawadi, 26, who has used hearing aids since she was 4 and attends medical school at the University of California, Los Angeles.
"This is one of the biggest things I've seen in a really long time in this space," she said.
Ms. Wing, the middle school teacher, said she decided to buy her new hearing aids just months before she would turn 26 and lose access to her parents' health insurance plan. Otherwise, the $ 4,000 prescription hearing aids would have been unaffordable, she said.
Ms. Wing worried about the durability and effectiveness of over-the-counter aids, compared with her prescription pair, which she expects to last at least five years.
"I wear glasses too, and I can't just get reading glasses from CVS -- I have to get them from the eye doctor," she said. "It's the same with my hearing aids."
Ms. Wing said she had many co-workers in their 40s and 50s who could probably benefit from hearing aids but are worried about negative perceptions. She tries to dispel that.
"I tell everyone that I know that I have hearing aids," Ms. Wing said, "just so that the stigma is less."

Still, she has not been sold on hearing aids. An audiologist in the United States recommended them, but her parents and their family doctor in China told her they were “only for old people.”
“I just don’t know if it’s necessary,” she said.
Zhou said she “probably listened to music too loud,” causing her hearing issues. That’s an increasingly common concern, according to the Hearing Loss Association, which has called noise-induced hearing loss a growing public health crisis.
Although long-term tracking data is not available, the association estimates that 12.5% of Americans between ages 6 and 19 have hearing loss as a result of listening to loud music, particularly through earbuds at unsafe volumes.
For those who need them, the new wave of over-the-counter aids can be more affordable than many prescription models. That makes them a good first choice for more young people, said Zina Jawadi, 26, who has used hearing aids since she was 4 and attends medical school at the University of California, Los Angeles.
“This is one of the biggest things I’ve seen in a really long time in this space,” she said.
Wing, the middle school teacher, said she decided to buy her new hearing aids just months before she would turn 26 and lose access to her parents’ health insurance plan. Otherwise, the $4,000 prescription hearing aids would have been unaffordable, she said.
Wing worried about the durability and effectiveness of over-the-counter aids, compared with her prescription pair, which she expects to last at least five years.
“I wear glasses too, and I can’t just get reading glasses from CVS — I have to get them from the eye doctor,” she said. “It’s the same with my hearing aids.”
Wing said she many of her co-workers in their 40s and 50s might benefit from hearing aids but were worried about negative perceptions. She tries to dispel that.
“I tell everyone that I know that I have hearing aids,” Wing said, “just so that the stigma is less.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The pop star was accused of copying the 1973 classic for his 2014 hit "Thinking Out Loud." He described the chords both songs use as "common building blocks."
A federal jury found on Thursday that the pop singer Ed Sheeran did not copy Marvin Gaye's classic "Let's Get It On" for his 2014 hit "Thinking Out Loud," in the music industry's highest-profile copyright case in years.
Over two weeks in a downtown Manhattan courtroom, Mr. Sheeran, one of music's biggest global hitmakers, testified -- often with a guitar in hand -- that "Thinking Out Loud" had been created independently one evening with his friend and longtime collaborator Amy Wadge. The song was inspired, he said, by the decades-long loves that he and Ms. Wadge observed among elders in their families.
The two tracks share a similar syncopated chord pattern that the family of Ed Townsend, Gaye's co-writer, which filed the suit, called the "heart" of "Let's Get It On." Mr. Sheeran and his lawyers never denied that the chords in the two songs are similar, but called them commonplace musical building blocks that have turned up in dozens of other songs.
The jury, which deliberated for around three hours, found that Mr. Sheeran had created his song independently.
"I am obviously very happy with the outcome of the case," Mr. Sheeran said in a statement that he read outside the courthouse. "At the same time, I am unbelievably frustrated that baseless claims like this are allowed to go to court at all."
"We have spent the last eight years talking about two songs with dramatically different lyrics, melodies and four chords which are also different and used by songwriters every day, all over the world," Mr. Sheeran continued. "These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before 'Let's Get It On' was written and will be used to make music long after we are all gone."
"I am just a guy with a guitar who loves writing music for people to enjoy," he added. "I am not and will never allow myself to be a piggy bank for anyone to shake."
After the verdict was read shortly after 1 p.m., Mr. Sheeran rose and hugged members of his legal team. He then walked over to Kathryn Griffin Townsend, Mr. Townsend's daughter, and embraced her too. The two spoke briefly.
After that, Ms. Townsend said that she respected the jury's decision and that she had defended her father's legacy.
"I stood up for my father's intellectual properties," she said. "I was up against an army."
The case, which was filed in 2017 and had been delayed in part by the coronavirus pandemic, involved questions of originality in pop music that have been tested in a series of recent cases, stoking fears among musicians that the line between inspiration and plagiarism was being muddied.
In a 2015 decision that shook the business, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams's song "Blurred Lines" was found to have infringed Gaye's "Got to Give It Up." Five years later, the tide turned: Led Zeppelin won an appeals court victory over its megahit "Stairway to Heaven," and the judges provided guidance about how copyright applies to works involving "commonplace elements."
In Mr. Sheeran's case, the plaintiffs argued that even if elements like chords may not be under copyright individually, their "selection and arrangement" on "Let's Get It On" was original and distinctive enough to warrant protection. Mr. Sheeran's side responded that the plaintiffs' case did not pass the high legal bar required for such protection.
At times, Mr. Sheeran, who has faced litigation stemming from accusations of copying twice before, grew vexed and combative at the stand.
"To have someone come in and say, 'We don't believe you, you must have stolen it,"' Mr. Sheeran said, "I find that really insulting."
He insisted that he did not borrow from "Let's Get It On," and, playing an acoustic guitar in the witness box, he showed that the chord progression at the core of both tunes, while similar, was not identical.
In "Thinking Out Loud," he testified, the second of the four chords in the progression was major, rejecting a suggestion by Alexander Stewart, a musicologist from the University of Vermont hired by the plaintiffs, that it was similar to a minor one in "Let's Get It On."
"I know what I'm playing on guitar," Mr. Sheeran said. "It's me playing the chords."
Mr. Sheeran also derided Mr. Stewart's analysis of his vocal melodies -- which included an example with some notes changed -- as "criminal."
A quirk of copyright law governed how the jury could hear the two songs. The case involved only the compositions underlying both tracks -- the lyrics, melodies and chords that can be notated on paper -- and not their recordings. For older songs like "Let's Get It On," copyright is limited to the sheet music, or "deposit copy," that was originally submitted to the United States Copyright Office. On "Let's Get It On," that notation was skeletal.
That meant that the jury never heard Gaye's original recording, which went to No. 1 in 1973. Instead, the defendants supplied a computer-generated re-creation of what appears on the deposit copy, complete with a robotic voice rendering lyrics like "If you feel like I feel, baby, then come on, let's get it on." The studio recording of Mr. Sheeran's song was heard multiple times.
One of the jurors, Sophia Neis, 23, said after the trial that "the song as we're allowed to hear it" and the "deposit copy" were key pieces of evidence in the jury's decision making.
"We ultimately came to what we thought was the right interpretation of the law," she said.
"It's obviously cool to have anyone play music in front of you live," she added, of Mr. Sheeran's decision to play on the stand. "That was an interesting surprise."
Ms. Townsend, who often wore a tan-colored coat with the word "integrity" emblazoned on the back to court, said she had filed her suit to protect her father's legacy. On Day 3 of the trial, the proceedings were interrupted when she collapsed and was taken to a hospital.
Among Ms. Townsend's litigators was Ben Crump, who has gained national renown as a civil rights lawyer representing the families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. In his opening statement, he told the jury that the evidence in the case included "a smoking gun": a fan video showing Mr. Sheeran move seamlessly between "Thinking Out Loud" and "Let's Get It On" at a European concert.
Mr. Sheeran defended his "mash-up" technique, saying he frequently played such medleys in concert, which are made possible by the limited harmonic palette of mainstream pop music. Cradling his guitar, he demonstrated for the jury.
"Most pop songs can fit over most pop songs," Mr. Sheeran said. "You could go from 'Let It Be' to 'No Woman, No Cry' and switch back."
In addition to Ms. Townsend, the plaintiffs in the case were a trust for Helen McDonald, Mr. Townsend's sister, who died after the case was filed, and the estate of Cherrigale Townsend, his former wife.
Besides Mr. Sheeran, the defendants included his label, Atlantic Records, and his publisher, Sony Music Publishing.
For the wider music industry, Mr. Sheeran's victory preserves a status quo about copyright. After the disruption of the "Blurred Lines" case, many commentators viewed Led Zeppelin's win as steering copyright cases back into more familiar territory. Katy Perry and her collaborators on the song "Dark Horse" were immediate beneficiaries of that ruling.
"This is a win for all songwriters, including the next Ed Townsend and the next Marvin Gaye," said Jennifer Jenkins, a law professor at Duke who specializes in music copyright. "The copyright over the original, creative features of 'Let's Get It On' remains intact, but this verdict frees up the scaffolding it was built upon."
After the verdict was read, Ms. Townsend said that she was glad to finally have the opportunity to speak one-on-one with Mr. Sheeran, and that he had invited her to a show on his tour, which opens on Saturday. "If we had been able to just talk," she said, "we wouldn't be here today."

In the Age of A.I., Counteracting Nostalgia's Allure: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Many artists are using the latest A.I.-powered digital techniques to create a nostalgic past -- an ironic throwback. Seth Price manages to be contemporary. In 1434, the high-tech medium of oil paint allowed the Flemish master Jan van Eyck to infuse his sumptuous double portrait of the Arnolfinis with astonishing depth. He couldn't resist showing off a little more: A convex mirror on the back wall contains a tiny self-portrait of the painter at work.
Six centuries later, when the multimedia artist and writer Seth Price includes an illusionistic mirrored sphere in the upper left of "Thought Comes from the Body II," a big, crackled black and Day-Glo painting on panel, it still signals virtuosity. In the reflection, you can make out two figures -- one of them may be Price -- crouching over a painting on a studio floor.
Van Eyck had to eke out this illusion by hand. Price used an app. His latest paintings, on view at Petzel in Chelsea through June 3, highlight a question that's easy to gloss over: Why are today's technologically attuned artists using advanced software, including A.I., to invoke the past?
For two decades, Price -- a New York conceptual artist collected by MoMA and the Whitney -- has adopted the manufacture and distribution of contemporary art as his subject matter, starting with his 2002 essay-artwork "Dispersion." Akin to suspending pigment in oils or coating glass with photosensitive silver salts, Price's paintings since 2020 have combined abstract dashes and pours with ominous portraits, jots of text, and backgrounds resembling notebook or sketchbook pages -- with the strikingly contemporary addition of trompe l'oeil chrome tubes and mirrors seemingly poking through their surfaces. To render those perfectly warped reflections, Price photographs a painting, adds shiny objects in 3-D modeling software, then matches those shapes to the physical panel with an industrial printer.
Five of his 11 paintings on view at Petzel incorporate A.I.-generated imagery, mostly buried in abstract spills and smears. But some have tells. The shaky anatomy and lumpy physics in Price's "Weken Style," a demure black and white diptych of a warped group of figures and a studio table cluttered with dreamlike tools, suggest the work of machines, as does their square composition, a format favored by the generative imagemaking A.I. called DALL-E. Indeed, Price conjured the pictures using A.I., printed them "wet" on plastic, then smeared the ink with his fingers, adding an inimitable human touch. (Many of Price's latest paintings feature another emblem of the artist's hand: the brush stroke, which artists from Roy Lichtenstein to Laura Owens employ to signal that, even though the technology and the thinking have changed, their work is still Art.)
The evidence of A.I. in "Danlivin" stands out from the painting's rings and splashes: the nonsensical phrase "THE TNETES 19989," the 9's in different fonts. This is the distinctive garbled diction of image-generators, which imitate the look of words but not necessarily their meaning.
The impulse to use A.I. to indulge nostalgia is palpable. This March, Boris Eldagsen's winning image in the Sony World Photography Awards in the Open Competition -- surprise! -- was A.I.-generated. It sure looks like a vintage photo, though: a black and white, worn-looking picture of two women, one hunching enigmatically behind the other. There's even a glow in the upper left corner, like a light leak on film. Eldagsen claims he entered the contest to spark discussion (and subsequently rejected the prestigious prize), while the judges assert that they happily selected the work of an algorithm. (Something's clearly off: As with so many photoshop fails, the hands don't match the torsos. Human anatomy, like words, can be tricky for image-generating A.I.'s.)
The ethics of truth in A.I.-generated media remain fraught, especially where politics and history are at stake. The analog photographers Herbert Ascherman and Shane Balkowitsch point specifically to the way anthropology-style pictures generated with prompts like "tintype of lost New Mexico tribe circa 1800s" could pollute, and effectively erase, the historical record.
But fretting about the use of A.I. in contemporary art is like ranting against the mechanical loom. Beyond the fog of novelty, it's worth asking what kinds of images artists ask of their software, and why.
As Eldagsen was shaking up the traditional photo world, Gagosian mounted a show in March at its Upper East Side outpost in New York by Bennett Miller, better known for directing movies like "Capote" and "Moneyball." These pictures are the progeny of DALL-E -- and yet they affect the wooziness of old photos. The square, sepia images portray Victorian children, vanished Indigenous American chiefs, and Hollywood-type "braves" tumbling from the cliffs. A picture of a tiny white flower on a fingertip is speckled as if printed from a dusty negative -- flaws that any photographer would have corrected but which, in the age of A.I., are the marks of ersatz authenticity.
The way these A.I.-generated images mimic "real photographs" is an ironic throwback to the 19th-century academic art establishment, which protested that photos, captured with mechanical and chemical means, were more scientific instruments than artistic media. Some photographers back then reacted with "pictorialism" -- a style that imitated painting by downplaying technical precision and dramatizing misty depths, soft focus and moody lighting.
Arguments against A.I.-generated art sound familiar: "There's no skill involved, you've only pushed a button." And some A.I. image-makers, too, have reacted by embracing romantic, retrograde styles, including the murky "past" of pictorialism.
There's nothing in Eldagsen's or Miller's fantasies that couldn't have been made by maquettes, models, even trusty photoshop -- 10, 20, 50 years ago. Granted, A.I. imaging programs aren't good at making new things. By design, they can only play "exquisite corpse" with huge collections of what they've been told are faces, or animals, or tintype portraits.
Price does more than imagine alternate, sepia-toned pasts. He incorporates the nostalgic impulse of A.I. as just one of the cacophony of styles that defines our present moment. In their weird mélange of old and new, printer and hand, Price's paintings embody the simultaneity that defines "the contemporary." His paintings describe the anxiety around what makes us human that A.I. provokes -- but they don't succumb to it.

Ellen Stutzman, a senior Writers Guild of America official, stood on a battered patch of grass outside Netflix headquarters in Los Angeles. She was calm — remarkably so, given the wild scene unfolding around her, and the role she had played in its creation.
“Hey, Netflix! You’re no good! Pay your writers like you should!” hundreds of striking movie and television writers shouted in unison as they marched outside the Netflix complex. The spectacle had snarled traffic on Sunset Boulevard on Tuesday afternoon, and numerous drivers blared horns in support of a strike. Undulating picket signs, a few of which were covered with expletives, added to the sense of chaos, as did a hovering news helicopter and a barking dog. “Wow,” a Netflix employee said as he inched his car out of the company’s driveway, which was blocked by writers.
In February, unions representing 11,500 screenwriters selected Stutzman, 40, to be their chief negotiator in talks with studios and streaming services for a new contract. Negotiations broke off Monday night, shortly before the contract expired. Stutzman and other union officials voted unanimously to call a strike, shattering 15 years of labor peace in Hollywood, and bringing the entertainment industry’s creative assembly lines to a grinding halt.
“We told them there was a ton of pent-up anger,” Stutzman said, referring to the companies at the bargaining table, which included Amazon and Apple. “They didn’t seem to believe us.”
The throng started a new chant, as if on cue. “Hey, hey! Ho, ho! This corporate greed has got to go!”
Similar scenes of solidarity unfolded across the entertainment capital. At Paramount Pictures, more than 400 writers — and a few supportive actors, including Rob Lowe — assembled to wave pickets with slogans like “Despicable You” and “Honk if you like words.” Screenwriting titans including Damon Lindelof (“Watchmen,” “Lost”) and Jenny Lumet (“Rachel Getting Married,” “Star Trek: Strange New Worlds”) marched outside Amazon Studios. Acrimony hung in the air outside Walt Disney Studios, where one writer played drums on empty buckets next to a sign that read, “What we are asking for is a drop in the bucket.”
Another sign goaded Mickey Mouse directly: “I smell a rat.”
But the strike, at least in its opening hours, seemed to burn hottest at Netflix, with some writers describing the company as “the scene of the crime.” That is because Netflix popularized and, in some cases, pioneered streaming-era practices that writers say have made their profession an unsustainable one — a job that had always been unstable, dependent on audience tastes and the whims of revolving sets of network executives, has become much more so.
The streaming giant, for instance, has become known for “mini-rooms,” which is slang for hiring small groups of writers to map out a season before any official greenlight has been given. Because it isn’t a formal writers room, the pay is less. Writers in mini-rooms will sometimes work for as little as 10 weeks, and then have to scramble to find another job. (If the show is greenlit and goes into production, fewer writers are kept on board.)
“If you only get a 10-week job, which a lot of people now do, you really have to start looking for a new job on day one,” said Alex Levy, who has written for Netflix shows like “Grace and Frankie.” “In my case, I haven’t been able to get a writing job for months. I’ve had to borrow money from my family to pay my rent.”
Lawrence Dai, whose credits include “The Late Late Show with James Corden” and “American Born Chinese,” a Disney+ series, echoed Levy’s frustration. “It feels like an existential moment because it’s becoming impossible to build a career,” he said. “The dream is dead.”
Studio executives have largely maintained public silence, instead leaving communication to the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on their behalf. In statements, the organization has said its goal was a “mutually beneficial deal,” which was “only possible if the guild is committed to turning its focus to serious bargaining” and “searching for reasonable compromises.”
On Monday, when talks broke down, the organization said the companies had made an offer that included “generous increases in compensation for writers.” The primary sticking points, it added, were union proposals that would require companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time, “whether needed or not.”
Samantha Riley, whose credits include “Hacks” and “Fresh Off the Boat,” started to breathe fire on the Netflix picket line when the conversation turned to the offer made by the companies. (The union made the proposals public.) “I’m offended by the offer,” Riley said. “It’s horrendous.”
In particular, writers were irate about the manner in which studios responded to their concerns about the impact of artificial intelligence on the future of screenwriting. The WGA wants studios to agree to protections that guarantee AI will not encroach on writers’ credits and compensation. The studios rejected the proposal, instead suggesting an annual meeting on advances in technology.
“Radicalized might be too strong of a word, but the studios, by doing that, made people even more unified,” said Tom Szentgyorgi, whose credits range from “The Mentalist” to “NYPD Blue.”
First-day enthusiasm notwithstanding, writers will find it no small task in coming weeks to block a production apparatus that, in the Los Angeles area alone, is spread across more than 100 studio facilities, several hundred postproduction houses and numerous location shoots that move from day to day. Hollywood’s most recent strike, in 2007, stretched for more than three months. The 2007 strike was in winter, when daytime temperatures in Los Angeles are in the 60s. The upcoming summer in Burbank, however, means 100-degree days, day after day.
Irene Turner, a veteran of the 2007 strike, was a bit weary after three hours of trudging in the sun outside Disney on Tuesday. But she was nowhere close to calling it quits. “This is super good for me because I sit on my butt on a laptop,” she said.
Turner, whose credits include the 2017 Netflix film “The Most Hated Woman in America,” called the strike “necessary and miserable,” adding that “a lot of people will get hurt.” The 2007 strike cost the Los Angeles economy an estimated $2.1 billion, with small businesses supporting television and film production also crunched.
Kevin Yee, an actor (“Dickinson”) turned screenwriter who was pumping his sign up and down furiously outside Warner Bros., said he was nervous about how long a strike could last.
“It felt like the producers wanted us to strike,” Yee said. “They’ve stopped greenlighting a lot of things in anticipation of this. So there wasn’t a lot for me to do anyways. With the current state of things, there is no hope for this industry unless they step up and they make this a sustainable career. So to me, I have nothing to lose.”

Full text: The animated film's grosses helped make April the first month to surpass its prepandemic average at the box office.
The animated film "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" crossed the $ 1 billion box-office threshold on Sunday, making it the fifth movie to do so since the start of the pandemic and the surest sign yet that the theatrical movie business is on the rebound after a prolonged downturn.
Despite middling reviews, the Universal Pictures film, which features Chris Pratt as the voice of the beloved video game character Mario, has been in theaters for only 26 days and is now the seventh biggest film in Universal's history, passing both "Jurassic World Dominion" and the animated "Despicable Me" in worldwide box office grosses.
Of the five films to cross the $ 1 billion mark since the pandemic began, "Super Mario" is the first animated one. Geared to families with young children -- and fans of the uber-popular Nintendo video game -- the movie provided a welcome reprieve to theater owners who had been concerned that the family film business was at risk of not returning to prepandemic levels. In fact, "Super Mario" helped push the April domestic box office up 11.5 percent compared with prepandemic levels, according to the box office analyst David A. Gross.
Mr. Gross called the stat "a breakthrough" since it marks the first month that has surpassed its prepandemic average. The 2023 year-to-date box office deficit is now down 21.8 percent compared with that average.
But not everything is coming up roses at the multiplex. The well-reviewed adaptation of Judy Blume's beloved children's novel "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret" pulled in only $ 6.8 million during its opening weekend. The PG-13 rated film, which cost $ 30 million to make and focuses on the challenges of prepubescent adolescence, was primarily viewed by Lionsgate, the studio behind the film, as a nostalgia play, and it worked in attracting women over 45 who were fans of the 50-year-old novel from their childhood. The company was less successful luring in an audience of teenage girls, but there is hope among box office analysts that strong word-of-mouth will bring in more moviegoers as Mother's Day weekend draws near.
Studios and their theater partners are optimistic about the summer season, which officially begins next weekend, when Disney will debut the third and final film in the "Guardians of the Galaxy" trilogy, directed by James Gunn. The 10th "Fast and Furious" movie will follow, and both movies are expected to be huge hits for May. Also buoying optimism is the array of family films headed to theaters this summer, including the live action adaptation of "Little Mermaid," coming at the end of May, along with Sony Pictures's "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" and Pixar's "Elemental," both headed to theaters in June.

This Tale Owns a Glass Jaw: [Review]

Full text: The fictionalized film, with the boxer himself as one of its executive producers, crams a lot of events into its running time, leaving its charismatic cast on the ropes.
The former boxer George Foreman's late-20th-century popularity as a television pitchman for a line of cooking products has enabled a collective amnesia. That is, we've forgotten just how extraordinary his sports career was. Boxing has given us many fighters who have won world champion titles more than once. But Foreman won his first heavyweight title bout in 1973. And after a long period, during which he had sworn to have lost interest in the sport, he came back and won another title in 1994, age 45.
Wow -- sounds like somebody ought to make a movie out of that. Too bad "Big George Foreman," directed by George Tillman, Jr., is so shockingly flat. Subtitled "The Miraculous Story of the Once and Future Heavyweight Champion of the World," it's a movie with its heart in the right place and its sense of drama nowhere in sight. It begins with Foreman's hunger-and-anger-driven youth. Enlisted in a jobs program, Foreman -- played by the charismatic Khris Davis in a decades-spanning depiction -- finds a mentor and trainer in Doc Broadus (Forest Whitaker, doing his low-key best with a character who's no more or less underdeveloped than every other one here). George, who can wallop like no other boxer, almost obliviously moves from strength to strength.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Until the fight against Muhammad Ali in Zaire, in which Ali took the heavyweight crown from Foreman. Rendered in world-historical terms in the 1997 documentary "When We Were Kings," here it's depicted as a career calamity for Foreman: his first loss, one he took hard.
Plot twist: Foreman found God and gave up boxing for preaching. With a second wife, he started a new family, and founded a youth center, which contained a room dedicated to his former rival Ali. But a series of business calamities -- rendered here as the screw-up of the single feckless and alcoholic school pal he'd put in charge of his finances -- forced him to pick up the gloves again.
All these events and more are rendered with a seeming undercurrent of we've-got-a-lot-to-cram-in-here jitters, and that's not even the worst of it. The script, by the director and Frank Baldwin, is a thicket of dialogue clichés replete with exchanges like "I want you" and "You have me!" The choreography of the fight scenes is uninspired. They're shot, as so many boxing scenes now are, with heavy "Raging Bull" influence and a thorough misunderstanding of Scorsese's approach in that film. His slow motion/fast motion alternation and camera-practically-in-the-glove shots weren't meant to convey exciting action but to accentuate the brutal physical punishment boxers give and receive. The movie not only doesn't do Foreman justice, it leaves Davis and the rest of the appealing cast on the ropes.

U.K. Blocks Microsoft's Acquisition of Activision: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The decision barring the takeover of a big video game publisher is a major victory for proponents of regulating tech giants, which have faced obstacles in the United States.
British antitrust regulators dealt a major setback on Wednesday to Microsoft's plans to acquire the video game giant Activision Blizzard for $ 69 billion, blocking the proposed deal and handing a notable win to government enforcers around the world who want to rein in Big Tech.
With its ruling, Britain's Competition and Markets Authority inflicted a possibly fatal blow to what would be the largest consumer tech acquisition since AOL bought Time Warner two decades ago. The agency said Microsoft's proposals to ensure that the acquisition would not harm competition "failed to effectively address the concerns in the cloud gaming sector," a nascent part of the gaming industry.
The surprising ruling bolstered an effort by the Federal Trade Commission to block the deal in the United States and was a clear victory for proponents of regulating tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, Facebook's parent company. Their efforts, fueled by fears that the companies wield too much power over online commerce and communications, have been stymied by recent court losses and legislative failures.
"This is a very big win for the broader effort to realign antitrust enforcement," said William E. Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C. Microsoft said it planned to appeal the ruling.
Much of the focus around whether the deal would harm consumers had focused on the market for expensive gaming consoles, but the Competition and Markets Authority zeroed in on cloud gaming, a relatively new technology that allows people to stream games to their devices, circumventing the need for hardware like gaming consoles.
The ruling was an indication that regulators around the world are broadening their antitrust lens to include emerging markets and are intent on helping to shape them before a handful of giant companies can dominate them. A failure to gain approval in a large market like Britain or the United States could force Microsoft to walk away from the acquisition, even though another regulatory body in the European Union has not made a final decision.
Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, has made challenging mergers a central part of her plan to rein in the tech giants. After the American agency filed a lawsuit in December to block the video game deal, Microsoft swiftly tried to isolate Ms. Khan by pushing European authorities to reach legal settlements that would address their concerns and allow the deal to go through. Antitrust regulators in the European Union are expected to rule on the acquisition by May 22.
But the British officials instead signaled that an era of easy blockbuster tech deals was over. The F.T.C. is building an antitrust case against Amazon, and Ms. Khan has said she is closely watching whether the tech giants will abuse their power in the race to develop artificial intelligence tools.
On Wednesday, the F.T.C. said it was aligned with the British regulator. "We also have concerns, as explained in our complaint, about the anticompetitive effects of this deal," Holly Vedova, the director of the agency's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.
Microsoft has said it wants to close the Activision acquisition by July 18. If its appeal fails, the company will probably have to walk away and pay a $ 3 billion breakup fee to Activision, ending what would have been one of the biggest shake-ups to the gaming industry in decades.
"We're especially disappointed that after lengthy deliberations, this decision appears to reflect a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works," Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, said in a statement.
Activision, the publisher of blockbuster games like Call of Duty, said it would "work aggressively" with Microsoft to reverse the ruling.
"If the C.M.A.'s decision holds, it would stifle investment, competition and job creation throughout the U.K. gaming industry," said Bobby Kotick, Activision's chief executive.
Activision's stock fell 11 percent by the close of trading. Shares of Microsoft, which were trading higher after it reported stronger-than-expected earnings on Tuesday, rose 7 percent on Wednesday.
Microsoft announced the deal to buy Activision early last year, hoping to combine Microsoft's Xbox console and video game subscription service with Activision's blockbuster games like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.
At the time, Activision was reeling from a California lawsuit accusing it of fostering a toxic, sexist workplace culture, and Mr. Kotick faced calls to resign.
For more than a year, the debate over the deal largely centered on what would happen to the hundreds of millions of people who played Activision's games. The company that opposed the deal the most vocally was Sony, which makes the PlayStation console, a competitor to Microsoft's Xbox. Sony argued that fans of Call of Duty and other Activision titles who can currently play the games on the Xbox or PlayStation would be forced to use Microsoft's consoles and services exclusively.
Sony declined to comment on the ruling.
Microsoft said it would not restrict Call of Duty to the Xbox, and it argued that the acquisition would give more people access to the games. It focused on reaching settlements with regulators outside the United States that would allow the deal to go through with some conditions. It also offered gaming platforms guaranteed access to Call of Duty in an effort to show it would not restrict the popular game on other consoles.
The British regulator initially said in February that the deal would hurt competition for gaming consoles like the PlayStation and the nascent cloud gaming industry, which involves harnessing the power of remote data centers to stream a game to a device like an iPhone or a computer. But in late March, it reversed course and said it no longer believed the deal posed a threat to Sony, which seemed to put Microsoft in a strong position.
Instead, the Competition and Markets Authority focused on the cloud gaming market, which has been around for just a few years, and on the possibility that cloud gaming could explode in popularity, eventually being worth $ 1.3 billion in Britain and $ 14 billion globally by 2026.
"The cloud allows U.K. gamers to avoid buying expensive gaming consoles and PCs and gives them much more flexibility and choice as to how they play," the agency wrote in its ruling on Wednesday. "Allowing Microsoft to take such a strong position in the cloud gaming market just as it begins to grow rapidly would risk undermining the innovation that is crucial to the development of these opportunities."
In the future, cloud gaming could untether gamers from consoles and shift the focus from hardware to technology that allows games to be streamed from remote data centers. Paired with Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's monthly game subscription service, which has more than 25 million subscribers, it could be a powerful tool. But it has not yet been widely adopted, and early forays into cloud gaming, from companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon, have struggled. The technology still encounters frequent glitches and requires a strong Wi-Fi connection.
"Cloud gaming longer term could be very big, but it would require a massive shift in how games are made and sold," said David Gibson, a senior analyst for MST Financial, a financial services company based in Australia.
In recent months, Microsoft signed a number of deals promising it would allow Activision's games to be played for 10 years on cloud streaming platforms, such as Nvidia's GeForce Now streaming service. But the Competition and Markets Authority said those solutions did not cover enough cloud business models.
The agency said Microsoft already accounted for 60 to 70 percent of cloud gaming services worldwide. If the deal closed, the agency said, Microsoft was likely to benefit from making Activision's games exclusive to its own cloud gaming platform, Xbox Cloud Gaming, which could harm consumers.
"This deal would strengthen that advantage giving it the ability to undermine new and innovative competitors," Martin Coleman, the chair of a panel that conducted an investigation for the agency, said in a statement.
The appeals process is likely to be relatively swift, but Microsoft will have to meet a high bar: The tribunal that oversees appeals looks mainly at whether a ruling was reached lawfully and reasonably, according to Pablo Ibáñez Colomo, a professor of law at the London School of Economics.
"This is a significant blow to the deal completing," said Piers Harding-Rolls, a gaming researcher at the analytics firm Ampere Analysis in London. "Inevitably this will delay things and will impact Xbox's commercial plans."

Full text: The effort demonstrated the creativity and resolve of an isolated country intent on defying demands that it abandon its nuclear weapons program.
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said on Monday that it had indicted four men on charges of laundering virtual currency stolen by an infamous North Korean online criminal syndicate as part of a far-reaching scheme to buy goods with U.S. dollars and evade international sanctions.
The charges, filed in three cases in federal court in Washington, outline a complex multiyear effort to launder cryptocurrency obtained by the Lazarus Group, an organization linked to espionage, online theft and cyberattacks, including the 2014 breach of Sony Pictures.
The scheme involved a relatively modest amount of currency. But it represents only a fraction of the illegal activity being undertaken by North Korea, officials said -- and it vividly demonstrated the creativity and resolve of an isolated country intent on defying demands that it abandon its nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs.
In the first indictment, the government charged a banker based in China, Sim Hyon Sop, 39, along with three cryptocurrency traders with conspiring to convert virtual currency that had been stolen from accounts into dollars. North Korea's government, short on cash, later used the money to buy goods, including tobacco and communications equipment, in 2018.
The second indictment outlined a related conspiracy by Mr. Sim, and various North Korean information technology workers who used fake identities to get jobs with blockchain companies in the United States. Several workers, and others not named in court papers, used that access to launder about $ 12 million that passed through Mr. Sim's cryptocurrency wallet, prosecutors said.
A third indictment describes an unlicensed money-transmitting business that conducted over 1,500 trades for U.S. customers without the necessary licenses.
Three of those charged, including Mr. Sim, were based in China and Hong Kong when, according to prosecutors, they committed their crimes, while a fourth was identified only by an online alias. None of them are currently in U.S. custody, and a Justice Department spokesman declined to say if the Biden administration will request their extradition.
The charges stemmed from "innovative attempts" by North Korean operatives to evade sanctions by "targeting virtual currency companies for theft," Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr., the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said in a statement.
In a related action, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Mr. Sim and the two men named by the Justice Department, Wu HuiHui and Cheng Hung Man. Brian E. Nelson, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said North Korea's effort to generate revenue using stolen virtual currency "directly threatens international security," and destabilizes the international financial system.
Since 2017, North Korea has pilfered an enormous amount of currency through fraud schemes and by hacking into virtual currency accounts. Operatives working at the behest of the country's intelligence services and military stole about $ 1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2022 alone, according to the Treasury Department.
North Korea employs a sprawling network of currency traders, many working out of China, meant to convert stolen virtual currency into so-called fiat currencies, like dollars and euros. That money is, in turn, used to buy badly needed goods for the government, military and leadership, investigators said.
Over the past few years, North Koreans in the country have been applying for jobs for remote development work without disclosing their identities and by misrepresenting their locations, allowing them to bypass security checks.
At the center of all these efforts is the Lazarus Group, which is under the direct control of North Korea's main intelligence agency.
The group has targeted the international financial, shipping, media and entertainment sectors to extract currency and sow disruption through data theft, malware heists and destructive malware operations. The Lazarus Group pulled off one of the largest virtual currency heists to date, stealing almost $ 620 million in virtual currency from a blockchain project linked to an online game in March 2022, according to U.S. officials.

One Start-Up Thinks Text Messages Could Be Next Social Media: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Community, which was first marketed as a way for celebrities to text their fans, now has big brands on board.
Andrew here. You probably received today's DealBook newsletter, as you always do, by email. But you probably got a bunch of spam and junk mail in your inbox, too.
That's why so many of us are moving our most important communications to text messages. And in the process, the "text inbox" has become the new holy space for brands, far more intimate than your social media feed.
At least, that's the bet that Ashton Kutcher, the actor turned venture capitalist, and Guy Oseary, Bono's and Madonna's manager turned investor, made when they co-founded a text message company called Community in 2019. In the beginning, it was marketed to celebrities to communicate with their fans about tour dates and new projects.
But over the last year, the business has quietly grown to power text messages from some of the largest brands, like McDonald's, HBO, the New York Yankees and Condé Nast. When this month's Hollywood blockbuster, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," launched an advertising campaign, it came with a phone number for viewers to text, powered by Community.
The company plans to announce next week that it has raised another $ 25 million, bringing its total fund-raising to $ 110 million, from investors such as Salesforce Ventures, Morgan Stanley Next Level Fund and Verizon Ventures. (It did not disclose its latest valuation.)
It also made Robert Wolf, a former chairman of UBS Group Americas, who served as an informal adviser to President Barack Obama, its new chairman. He started helping to sign up large corporate customers over the past year, bringing the total clients to over 8,000. The company is run by Diankha Linear, a longtime executive who served as an Army logistics and transportation officer.
Community has gained its latest funding as questions have increasingly arisen about social media's reach and how companies can own the digital relationship with their customers without a middleman like Facebook or Twitter.
"I started out with Twitter and built a fairly large following on Twitter," said Mr. Kutcher, who has 16.8 million followers. "But Twitter today is very different than what Twitter was when I originally started playing around it," he added. "The click-through rates are massively degraded -- the number of people that actually see the post is massively degraded."
At Community, in contrast, "we have like 45 percent click-through rates and 98 percent open rates," Mr. Kutcher said. "You don't get that in social environments because most people don't even see the things you're posting."
Community competes with a bevy of different types of services vying for space in your text inbox, from Attentive to Twilio to Zendesk. And many of the software platforms that companies use to manage their relationships with customers now have features that facilitate texting.
But what sets Community apart is the dialogue that celebrities and brands have with their customers, who provide troves of information about themselves, which the brand owns and isn't shared with Community's other clients.
Oseary was originally drawn to Community because of his role as a music manager, he said.
"I have no way to know who came to the concert tonight. I have no way to speak to them again once they leave the concert. I have no way to know who bought the album," he said. "With Community, once they text the number, we now have a way to stay in touch directly. And that information is not owned by anyone but the artist, the talent or the person who's building a business."
Companies advertise a phone number that users text to sign up for updates. McDonald's posted its number on a billboard in Times Square just this month. The service also allows brands to segment customers who sign up for texts, so if an artist has an concert coming up in Atlanta, only people in Atlanta get the texts.
Using text messages to connect with customers, for all its promise, poses unique challenges. Brands are required to get their customers to opt in to messages, which is hard to do unless the brand is already well established. And customers may want to hear from fewer brands in their text inbox than they do in their email inbox.
"As opposed to email, when you have to scroll to the bottom of the thing and hit the link that says unsubscribe, if you don't like the text messages you're getting, you only have to write one word: Stop," Mr. Kutcher said. (That's some news you can use.)
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Rupert Murdoch makes another deal. Fox News settled a defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems at the last minute for $ 788 billion. The deal allowed Murdoch and his company's executives to avoid having to testify, but it also handed Staple Street, the private equity owner of Dominion, a big payday after it bought the company for $ 38 million in 2018. His son Lachlan, C.E.O. of Fox Corporation, also settled a separate defamation suit against an Australian publisher this week.
Return to sender. Netflix ended its DVD delivery service after 25 years. The streaming company's original business model revolved around sending discs by mail, and at its peak, in 2010, about 20 million subscribers used the service. The company announced the changes as it reported first-quarter profits of $ 1.3 billion, up 4 percent year on year.
Gary Gensler gets a grilling. The chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was hammered by Republicans over the agency's handling of the cryptocurrency industry, in an appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. Gensler defended the regulator, saying he had never seen a sector break so many securities laws with such regularity, after being accused of failing to spot problems at FTX before the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed.
China's economy bounces back, kind of. In its first full quarter since Beijing lifted punishing Covid restrictions, the world's second-largest economy beat expectations on the back of surging consumer spending, rising exports and government-led infrastructure spending. But youth unemployment hit 19.6 percent, its second-highest mark on record, suggesting that businesses are not convinced that Beijing is finished dabbling in the private sector and that economic uncertainty is over.
Goldman Sachs quickens its retail banking U-turn. The Wall Street giant reported lackluster first-quarter returns and accelerated its retreat from consumer banking, including putting its GreenSky unit up for sale just a year after buying the lending company for $ 2.2 billion. One spot of new business: The bank introduced a savings account with Apple that offers a 4.15 percent annual interest rate -- more than 10 times the national average.
BMW gets into hot water over ice cream. The German carmaker was forced to apologize after being accused of discriminating against Chinese visitors to the Shanghai auto show this week. Images went viral on Chinese social media of workers at its booth appearing to give free ice cream to a western man after telling ethnic Chinese attendees that they had run out.
Term of the week: 'Greenhushing'
Ever since Earth Day was established in 1970, companies have advertised their green initiatives on April 22. But with many Republicans now taking a strong stand against corporate environmentalism and targeting companies that publicize their climate change-related goals, you might see fewer companies touting their green credentials this year. Instead, some businesses are resorting to "greenhushing." An analysis of 1,200 companies published last fall by South Pole, a Swiss consultancy, found that one in four planned to go green but then "go dark" -- that is, keep its green goals under the radar.
A.I., the artist
Artificial intelligence has had a creative few weeks: A song that used A.I. to mimic the voices of Drake and The Weeknd went viral; a murder-mystery novel penned using A.I. is available to preorder; and an image generated by A.I. won one of the world's biggest photography prizes. DealBook wrote last week that A.I. was creating thorny copyright issues, but it is also raising questions about the nature of human creativity itself.
Companies have tried to draw lines between human and machine-generated work. Streaming services, including Spotify and Apple Music, pulled the tech-created song from their platforms this week. And Universal Music Group urged the services to block A.I. from scraping its songs for use as training data.
Some artists see creative possibilities rather than threats. Stephen Marche, who wrote the cheekily titled "Death of an Author" novel using three A.I. programs, compared the process to composing hip-hop: "You don't necessarily know how to drum, but you definitely need to know how beats work, how hooks work, and you need to be able to put them together in a meaningful way," he told The New York Times. "I am the creator of this work, 100 percent," Marche said, "but, on the other hand, I didn't create the words."
Who is the creator? Boris Eldagsen, the Berlin artist whose A.I.-generated "Pseudomnesia: The Electrician" won the creative open category at the Sony World Photography Awards, told DealBook that making the image had been like directing a film.
"On a movie there is a set director, there is a cameraman, and there is an actress and a story writer, and I tell them which direction to go," he said. "I am the one, as an artist, who needs to connect all of this to the world, the human condition."
He entered the competition to kick-start a conversation about separating the art of photography from A.I.-generated art, which he considers co-creation.
But who should take credit for this type of collaboration? Generative A.I. is informed by reference material created by human artists. It becomes more complicated when A.I. is used to imitate a particular performer, or a specific artist's drawing style. Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America launched a "human artistry campaign," which argues that the makers of A.I. need to license copyrighted work they use as training data. And Holly Herndon, a musician, started a company to build consent guidelines for the tech. "The creative possibilities there are fascinating and will change art forever," she told The Times. "We just have to figure out the terms and tech."

A Choreographer Puts His View of 'Carmen' in Motion: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The choreographer is trying his hand at filmmaking with an experiment that merges drama, dance and music.
PARIS -- Benjamin Millepied probably didn't need to take on any new life challenges. A former principal dancer with New York City Ballet, the French-born Millepied has been an established, sought-after choreographer for almost two decades, has directed the Paris Opera Ballet, and runs the L.A. Dance Project, which he founded in 2012. And he recently moved back to Paris with his wife, the actress Natalie Portman, and their two young children.
Now, Millepied, 45, has also directed his first feature film, "Carmen," starring Paul Mescal, Melissa Barrera and Rossy de Palma, with an original score by Nicholas Britell ("Moonlight," "Succession"). The movie is a hard-to-categorize blend of drama, dance and music that draws loosely on the narrative of Georges Bizet's 1875 opera, setting much of the action on the Mexico-U.S. border, with Mescal as a traumatized war veteran who saves Barrera's Carmen, a Mexican immigrant fleeing from danger.
Millepied had long been a keen amateur photographer and a cinephile, and had made a number of short dance films, when, through Portman, he met Britell. "We began to talk about movies and about collaborating," Millepied said. "'Carmen' was the idea that stuck."
In a telephone conversation, Britell mentioned that he had recently found an email exchange with Millepied from more than 10 years ago in which they had discussed "Carmen" as "a touchstone for imagining an experimental dream world." Britell added that although neither man was entirely sure what that meant at the time, "the wonderful thing about working with Ben is that he is open to following his instincts and to experimentation. He had such a strong sense of what he was looking for, but also left me to make my own discoveries about how the music would work."
The hybrid, idiosyncratic nature of the film was a draw for Mescal ("Normal People," "Aftersun"). "It was so unconventional, outside of any genre I could firmly put my finger on, which was a challenge that really appealed to me," he said.
Part of that challenge, he added, was the dancing. "I am not a dancer, but Benjamin knows how people's bodies work," he said. "He knew what I could do, which was essentially to support Melissa." Barrera ("In the Heights," "Scream VI") added that the experience of making the film had been "different from anything else I've done."
"I am a very rational actor, always overthinking things, wanting clarity," she said. "Benjamin would say, 'Trust me: Everything is communicated with body language and eyes."'
After the movie showed at the Toronto International Film Festival last year, critics were divided. For IndieWire, David Ehrlich wrote: "'Carmen' is stretched across a few too many borders to ever feel like it's standing on solid ground. And yet, it's undeniably exhilarating." Other reviewers were less sure. "It's an unsteady composition, a frenzied combination of willowy movement pieces, an ecstatic score and a too-loose narrative," Lovia Gyarkye wrote in The Hollywood Reporter.
Over coffee, Millepied discussed the critical reaction to the film, the allure of "Carmen" and working with actors. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Why did you want to direct a film?
I always had a personal hobby of taking photos, a need to really look at what I was interested in visually. And I have always loved film; I remember watching "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" and Satyajit Ray's "The Music Room," when I was around 9 years old. When I was at the School of American Ballet in my teens, I went to movies all the time. I always had this dream at the back of my head about directing a film.
What was the pull of "Carmen"?
Early on, when I was starting to think about the story, I had dinner with [the director] Peter Sellars and mentioned I wanted to make a "Carmen" film. He got kind of passionate, and said, "You have to reinvent it, it's a terrible story." I thought he was right. It's a 19th-century tale, where the woman gets punished for her sins by getting murdered, and can't love or be loved. I was interested in her essence -- her freedom, her fire.
I wanted to tell this woman's story. It definitely had something to do with my relationship with my mother, to a connection to family history and emotions.
Did you think of your version as a musical?
I was interested in how to tell a modern story, and use music and dance in a way that doesn't pause the narrative, isn't decorative but integral. In the end, the movie tells a lot of the story through movement.
The collaboration with Nicholas was huge, and the part of making the film that was closest for me to making a ballet. We would sit at the piano and I would describe the scenes I had in mind, and he would write music and send it to me. It really influenced the mood and aesthetic -- gave me visual ideas just as if I was creating a dance.
What kind of preparation did you do?
I have too much respect for the craft, effort and practice it takes to choreograph something not to be equally conscientious about directing. I watched and analyzed hundreds of films, read film histories and found amazing resources online. I fell in love with so many directors that I felt were choreographers, who moved people and the camera with such imagination and complexity. Elia Kazan, Kurosawa, Bresson, Antonioni, Sally Potter, Kubrick: I watched, I watched, I watched, and I learned.
I also made a short narrative film, a "Romeo and Juliet," with Margaret Qualley, which I never showed but was very helpful in showing me the process.
Talking about the way you worked, Rossy de Palma said, "The camera becomes another dancer and dances with you." Did your experience as a choreographer help as a film director?
I think it helped with the physicality of the acting. We shot some of the movie in Australia, and while the actors were quarantining, I had them do Gaga classes, a technique for exploring every part of your body. It's a great thing to do to make sure your expressiveness is not just cerebral. And it definitely helped with staging complex scenes. I think also, because of my background, I was unafraid of letting bodies speak: using physicality to tell the story.
How did you approach directing actors?
I had the benefit of listening to Natalie talk about her experiences and collaborations. It was daunting, definitely, and I had to rely on my instincts about what felt true to the story. Obviously you need to know the back story of your characters inside out, but you also have to let them surprise you. I was lucky to have great actors. We were playful, we were free with the dialogue, and we always tried to see if there were interesting places to go.
The film had mixed reviews at Toronto, some quite negative. How did you feel about that?
I have too much experience of being reviewed to think about that too much. When George Balanchine premiered Liebeslieder Walzer, a masterpiece of 20th-century ballet, someone said to him, "Look how many people are leaving." He said, "Look how many people are staying."
I make my work with as much discipline as I can, and I am very lucky to be able to do that; it's a great honor. The financial stakes for movies are very different to making a ballet. But, you know, if I can't make films freely, I'll make furniture. There are always ways to be creative.

Dance and Music Propel A Fractured Classic Tale: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The choreographer Benjamin Millepied's directing debut is an of-the-moment but scattered take on a classic love story.
You can't have "Carmen" without the color red.
In the choreographer Benjamin Millepied's debut film -- an adaptation of the classic story, previously told in prose by Prosper Mérrimée and more famously in opera by Georges Bizet -- it's there from the start, in the opening titles, the pedals of a rose, the title heroine's shirt.
But nothing more than color signifies that this is a "Carmen" tale, that old psychosexual drama of a male soldier so seduced by a Spanish femme fatale, he forgets his duties and is driven to jealousy and murder. No, here Carmen is instead a young Mexican woman both headstrong and naïve, restless and searching -- much like the film itself.
That is disappointing for a movie seemingly assembled from promise: in Millepied, an enterprising dance-maker who pioneered small-screen performance during the pandemic; in Nicholas Britell, a composer of knockout, earworm-rich soundtracks; in Rossy de Palma, an alluring, otherworldly fixture of Pedro Almodóvar films; and in Paul Mescal, a fast-rising, Oscar-nominated star capable of conveying swaths of biography and feeling in a sadly handsome smile.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
They make for a film with elements of dance on camera, musical, of-the-moment melodrama and visual poetry -- but without a thorough commitment to any one of those and few, if any, moments of coalescence. The screenplay is spare to the point of meager; characters speak in clichés, like claiming that music won't pay the bills, and are divided, boringly, into categories of unequivocally good (Mexican immigrants mainly) and bad (all white characters except Mescal's Aidan).
No dialogue, anyway, communicates more effectively than Britell's soundtrack, a constant presence, tense and evocative, functioning like opera by fully integrating with, if not driving, the story rather than underscoring it. The movie also says more through movement than speech: percussive flamenco; climactic krumping in a fight sequence starring and set to an original song by the D.O.C.; a touching pas de deux of Carmen's balletic fluidity and Aidan's awkward, failing attempts to match her.
Little seems to keep this couple of lost souls -- he a tormented war vet, she an undocumented Mexican immigrant on the run -- together other than fear. As Carmen, Melissa Barrera is beautiful but somewhat blank, an obtuse mystery next to Mescal, his face having the shape and solemnity of a Roman statue, but eyes that repeatedly betray his pain. De Palma is a welcome source of levity as Masilda, a nightclub owner who tells Aidan that if she were younger she would eat him up like a plate of chilaquiles.
Masilda tells Carmen that her name means poem, that she is "the most beautiful poem made into a woman." Yet much of the film's poetry comes from the cinematography of Jörg Widmer -- a veteran of Terrence Malick's sweeping, awe-struck camera gestures -- who renders a desert landscape expansive and entrapping, and finds wonder in the otherwise stressful tangle of Los Angeles freeways. Millepied relishes close-ups of bodies in motion, and scatters dreamy symbolism throughout the story, populating his world with angels of death.
Carmen and Aidan are connected, before they meet, by small flames that rise spontaneously from the ground. In the end, they are separated by tragedy. Their trajectory couldn't be simpler, but this film, at nearly two aimless hours, doesn't seem interested in, or capable of, that kind of focus.

Full text: A fight was brewing recently at the Metropolitan Opera, and Angela Gheorghiu was in the thick of it.
She and some other singers were rehearsing the second act of Puccini's "Tosca," and the moment had arrived when Cavaradossi, the passionate tenor lead, scuffles with the henchmen who are restraining him.
Gheorghiu -- the glamorous, veteran Romanian soprano singing the opera's title role in two performances, on Saturday afternoon and Wednesday evening -- was standing in such a way that the melee was driving right toward her. Sarah Ina Meyers, the revival's director, began to pause to give her a new position out of the fray, but Gheorghiu practically shouted at everyone to keep going; she would figure out where to move on the fly.
"I will respond; I'm quick!" she told them in an excited, heavily accented tumble of words. "Go, go! Action, action!"
"Generally my colleagues say, 'Angela, relax!"' she said in an interview later. "But I cannot relax. Even when I study at home, I'm there. When I open a score, I'm there. My skin, my cells, they're all there. I'm alive; I have the fire on me."
Where Gheorghiu, 57, has not been of late is the Met. Though she was long a frequent presence with the company after her debut in 1993, these performances of "Tosca" are her first appearances on its stage in eight years.
"It's an unfair gap," she said of her time away. "It's unfair because I know I have my public here, and it's part of my life."
Grand of manner and demanding, but also generous and gregarious, taking grinning selfies for Instagram with everyone in the room, Gheorghiu is well known -- and generally well liked, even by colleagues she exasperates -- for being one of the few remaining divas in the larger-than-life, old-school mold of Geraldine Farrar, Maria Callas and Jessye Norman.
Old-school in the tumult that has tended to accompany her: cancellations, firings, willful behavior, a long marriage of ups and downs to the star tenor Roberto Alagna (until their divorce 10 years ago). And old-school in her voice, which as she was gaining renown was full and dark-hued, flexible and free to the top of its range.
"She is a serious artist," said Jack Mastroianni, who spent years as her manager. "I think sometimes people forget that because of the sensational news that comes out of her cancellations, or whatever. She's always interesting, no matter what -- onstage, offstage."
Because Gheorghiu was joining a "Tosca" run already in progress, she wouldn't be getting any rehearsal time onstage, with the orchestra, or in costume.
"I don't know what was on his mind," she said of Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager. "First of all, he offered me one performance. And I said, for one performance, I will not come. Just one? Come on. I would spend it all on my flight! And of course I need a hotel. So, two."
But why accept a mere two?
"Because," she said, with a sigh, "I must tell you the truth. I adore this city. I adore this theater, from the very beginning."
At the beginning, it was a love affair. Of Gheorghiu's 1993 debut, in "La Bohème," Alex Ross wrote in The New York Times that "the preternatural beauty of the voice made a lingering impression."
Ovations at the Met were a long way from small-town Adjud, Romania, where she was born in 1965 to a dressmaker mother and a train operator father. The Soviet-backed regime of Nicolae Ceausescu was then just beginning, an era that later informed her depiction in "Tosca" of life in early-19th-century Rome amid the repressive forces of the police chief Scarpia.
"Tosca, it's myself," Gheorghiu said. "I'm an opera singer, like her. And I'm not a killer, but I lived in a situation in Romania where you had no right to say something, where you were all the time afraid."
As a child, she was obsessed with Leonard Bernstein's television specials, and began to study voice seriously in her early teens.
"I was an opera singer, all my life, from the beginning," she said. "It was so clear. I didn't have a Plan B. Never, never. And for all my roles, from when I was 18, I had no teacher, no coach, no pianist. I am my own everything."
Mastroianni said: "What she went through to get from where she was, it takes guts and moxie. And she has that in spades."
Gelb first heard her sing Violetta in Verdi's "La Traviata" in the early 1990s, then tried (unsuccessfully) to sign her to Sony Classical when he ran the label.
"When she was singing 'Traviata' in her prime," he said, "I think hers was the greatest 'Traviata' of that time. She was a throwback to the kind of glamorous divas of previous generations, with incredible artistic personality and charisma."
Her voice -- clean and pure, with alluring depths but without heavy vibrato or overwhelming size -- was perfect for capture on CDs. It was the tail end of the classical recording industry's heyday, and she was lavishly promoted.
"It was a voice that microphones loved," Gelb said. Gheorghiu still comes across as valuing recordings more urgently than do some singers -- "We have to leave a testimony," she said -- and there are certain roles she has sung for albums but never onstage, like an exquisite Cio-Cio-San in "Madama Butterfly."
Almost as soon as she entered the international scene, she became a star at the Royal Opera House in London, a home base in those early years. She divorced her first husband and married Alagna; in a curtain speech before they appeared together in "La Bohème" at the Met in 1996, Joseph Volpe, then the company's general manager, announced that the two had been wed the previous day. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the mayor of New York at the time and an opera aficionado, officiated.
The following year, on tour with the Met in Japan, Gheorghiu refused to wear the blonde wig for her character, Micaëla, in "Carmen," and Volpe uttered what became an immortal line among opera fans: "The wig goes on, with or without you." (For one performance, she chose without, and an understudy replaced her.)
Appearing and recording frequently as a duo, she and Alagna grew notorious for their hubristic demands. They attempted to veto Franco Zeffirelli's designs for a new Met "Traviata" in the late 1990s; the show went on, without them. Gheorghiu still sang in New York, but from 2003 to 2005 she was absent for two seasons in a row, which hadn't happened since her debut.
When Gelb took over, in 2006, he tried to rectify this and bring her back in full force. Gheorghiu said that he eventually offered a contract that required her to sing at least 18 performances a year, which would have restricted her ability to take on engagements in Europe.
"And finally, I said no," she said. "And from this moment, I think he was upset. That's why I was more rare here."
("I have no recollection of that," Gelb said. "If I spent my life being offended by opera singers, I would have ended my career a long time ago.")
She abandoned a new Met production of "Carmen," in which she was to sing the title role, as well as a new staging of "Faust" whose updated concept she disliked.
A new production of Puccini's "La Rondine," a rarity for whose wistful mood Gheorghiu was well suited, did go forward, in 2009. But over the following decade, there were just a pair of "Bohème" performances in 2014 and the brief stint in "Tosca" in 2015 -- in which her voice, never huge, sometimes seemed perilously slender.
"When she was last here, there were mixed results," Gelb said. "Like many members of the audience, she did not like the Luc Bondy production, and she decided to do her own staging. So she kind of defied the directorial team; she sort of went off the reservation."
The current Met "Tosca," a throwback to Zeffirelli-style realistic splendor, is more to Gheorghiu's taste, but she is just as headstrong as ever about taking direction. There was, throughout the recent rehearsal, the sense that she wanted to leave as much of the blocking as possible to what her impulse might end up being in the moment.
"I like acting," she said as Meyers, the director, tried, to little avail, to guide her toward setting in stone a sequence in which Scarpia mauls Tosca onto a divan. "But so you don't see the acting. Reality."
Gheorghiu would like for this not to be her Met farewell; she'd love to sing Fedora here, and Adriana Lecouvreur.
"I feel home here," she said. "I really adore each centimeter: the dust, the smell, the sweating onstage, the costumes, the atmosphere in rehearsal. So I had some friendly discussion with Peter, and I feel like, of course, give me this, then what else? Let's see how this goes."
Gelb didn't commit. "But I've always admired her and I always will admire her," he said. "She's part of opera history, and part of opera history at the Met."

A Dedicated Cast for a Determined Director: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The director Kelly Reichardt has developed something of a troupe of performers who are eager to work with her time and time again. A few of them appear in her latest film, "Showing Up."
In her new film "Showing Up," the director Kelly Reichardt reunites for the fourth time with the actress Michelle Williams, who plays Lizzy, a stressed-out sculptor, in the Portland-set art world comedy. In previous Reichardt films Williams has portrayed a drifter looking for her lost dog ("Wendy and Lucy"), a beleaguered and dehydrated pioneer ("Meek's Cutoff") and a Montana woman trying to acquire sandstone for her new house ("Certain Women"). At this point, Reichardt and Williams's collaboration is one of the most fruitful in the realm of indie cinema.
"She has extreme depth perception," Williams said of Reichardt in a phone interview. "She can see where my sight stops, so I do what I can and I add what I can, but I really am trusting her to take me to the new place, to the next frontier."
But Williams is not alone in being drawn to Reichardt. "Showing Up," now in theaters, also marks the second time Reichardt has enlisted John Magaro, last of her acclaimed 2020 feature "First Cow," and the third time she's brought on James Le Gros, who has shown up in her 2013 eco-thriller "Night Moves" and also in the 2016 omnibus "Certain Women." In "Showing Up," Magaro plays the mentally ill brother of Williams's character, while Le Gros plays a teacher at the art school where she works.
In the nearly three decades since her first feature "River of Grass," Reichardt has developed something of a troupe of actors who are eager to work with her time and time again. In addition to the repeat performers from "Showing Up," others have made multiple Reichardt films, among them Larry Fessenden, Will Oldham and Will Patton.
"There's no requirement to come back," Magaro said. "A lot of these people go on and make a lot more money doing other jobs." But the actor said that there was a reason people return. "At the heart of it is Kelly and that team and that camaraderie and that family atmosphere she creates."
Reichardt works with small budgets and often in and around Portland, Ore., telling intimate stories that often focus on outsiders and the minutiae of life, whether she's making a movie set in a fur trapping community in the 19th century or at an art school in the present. "Showing Up" is arguably her lightest film yet, a funny exploration of the quotidian struggles of being an artist.
The director's resources have grown since she made "Wendy and Lucy" (2008) -- her first collaboration with Williams -- but not by much. Reichardt remembered the actress, who had recently received her first Oscar nomination, sitting on an apple box on the side of the road during the filming of "Wendy." "We had nothing," Reichardt said. She also explained that, on "Night Moves," Eisenberg and Dakota Fanning helped push a car out of a ditch and lugged equipment around with the rest of the crew.
"You really need to be the kind of person who wants to pitch in and who doesn't mind that there aren't walls between people and that you might be asked to drive yourself to work," Williams said. Over the years Reichardt has recruited big name stars including Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart and Laura Dern, but she has said that "plenty of people" still say no to her. Acting in a Reichardt movie is not for everyone, she herself admitted.
"I have a great rejection letter from Chris Cooper," she said. "He just wrote, 'I don't want to live through this."' (A representative for Chris Cooper did not have a comment.)
Reichardt does not begrudge that response. "People are smart, like Michelle is down for it and is really game and you have to have people that are up for this kind of filmmaking," she said, adding, "otherwise they'll be very unhappy."
The lack of hierarchy on Reichardt's sets also manifests onscreen, in some of Reichardt's artistic choices. Patton recalled throwing away his ego on "Meek's Cutoff," about a group of pioneers in the arid Oregon desert under the guidance of a bloviating leader (Bruce Greenwood). "At a certain point you say, 'OK, maybe you see me in a distance walking up a hill for this whole movie," he said. "That's kind of wonderful in a way."
That said, it was a wide shot in "Meek's" that first made Magaro take notice of Reichardt as a filmmaker. The "brave" choice made him want to seek out more of her work.
In addition to "brave," Reichardt was described in interviews for this piece as a "genius" (by Williams), a "rascal" (by Hong Chau, who makes her Reichardt debut in "Showing Up"), and scary, of all adjectives, by Le Gros. "She scares me a little bit," he said. "I don't want to get her on my bad side." When asked to explain why the small-in-stature Reichardt scares him, Le Gros said, "Any room that she's in, she's the toughest one there."
Reichardt knows what she wants and she is relentless in her pursuit of that. "She's very decisive and uncompromising and she has a vision in her head and nothing is going to stop her from getting that on the screen whether that's hail storms or oxen or 120-degree heat," Williams said. But rather than Reichardt's vision being restrictive, it's actually liberating, according to Williams. "You can trust her to the ends of the Earth because of the filmmaker that she is," the actress added.
Reichardt, for her part, doesn't think about actors when writing her films, which she often pens alongside Jon Raymond, who co-wrote "Showing Up." When it came to Lizzy, an exhausted artist preparing for a show, what first made Reichardt consider Williams for the role was a photo of the sculptor Lee Bontecou.
There's no rehearsal on a Reichardt film, but Reichardt does provide her actors with reference materials before they arrive on set. Chau recalled the casting director Gayle Keller arriving at her house with a box of books and art supplies Reichardt wanted her to have before portraying Lizzy's landlord Jo, a fellow artist with a slightly haughty demeanor.
Beyond reading, there is also often an experiential element to preparing for a Reichardt film. The cast of "Meek's Cutoff" went to a "pioneer camp," while Magaro ventured into the wilderness with his "First Cow" co-star, Orion Lee, and a survivalist who gave them roadkill-skinning lessons. In the case of "Showing Up," Chau shadowed the artist Michelle Segre, while Williams observed Cynthia Lahti, who provided the delicate statues of women that Lizzy makes.
"I feel like that's what it is with getting to work on films like 'Showing Up' or getting to work with Kelly Reichardt is what you do offset is just as important or if not more important than what you are doing on set," Chau said.
Williams has now been traveling to Portland to make films with Reichardt for 15 years and considers it a "homecoming." She has even considered moving there full time. Williams remembered that way back when she was joining "Wendy and Lucy," Reichardt told her, "I can't promise you much but on set we'll have good coffee and good sandwiches." To Williams, that sounded great.
Now they have some more amenities but the spirit of their work remains the same. "As these movies have gotten a little bit bigger and have gotten more attention, we still carry this incredible intimacy," Williams said.
And others want to come along. "I hope I get to join her little troupe of actors," Chau said. "I will always show up to whatever Kelly does if she invites me."

5 Films That Inspire A Fan of the Bizarre: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: The French director, whose latest film is "Smoking Causes Coughing," spoke about five comedy clips that have inspired his work.
Quentin Dupieux's offbeat comedies put people into bonkers situations and watch them do their best. And their best -- God bless us -- is often pretty hopeless. In "Mandibles," a couple of guys find a dog-size fly and try to hide it in their car trunk. In "Deerskin," a man (the Oscar winner Jean Dujardin) gets fixated on soft leather jackets and goes to murderous lengths to acquire one.
The genius of these what-on-earth scenarios is that the actors play it all straight. That makes for laughs, but there's also a general circuit-frying glee at Dupieux's unpredictable left turns. (Also fun: He casts French stars like Adèle Exarchopoulos and Benoît Magimel, happily going rogue.)
The director's latest, "Smoking Causes Coughing" (in theaters), has a plot best described as "superheroes on vacation." This Power Rangers-style squad usually battles (very lo-fi) monsters, but they're taking some time to regroup. (Their name? The Tobacco Force.)
On a recent video call, Dupieux talked about clips from five movies that inspired him -- and crack him up. Below are his thoughts, condensed and edited.
'The Phantom of Liberty' (1974)
Director: Luis Buñuel
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's just amazing that a brain can come up with this idea. It's so smart and silly at the same time. The toilets around the table is already something, but then the final gag is that he locks himself in another room to eat! When you're a filmmaker, this movie is the dream: You start a story, you finish it quickly, you open the door and there's a new story. Sometimes movies tend to be too scripted, and I love that in this movie you flip the rules and just tell the story exactly how you want.
When I was making my first short films, my friend gave me a VHS tape of this movie, and it was a shock because it's exactly what I was trying to do. But I don't like the word "surreal" [for my films]. When these guys were making these types of movies, and when Salvador Dalí was making his art, surrealism meant something strong. It was a concept. Today, I have a feeling the word has lost its magic meaning. At the same time, I have no other word! But why do we need a label?
'Top Secret!' (1984)
Directors: Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Oh my God, I don't need to click to watch because I've watched this scene so many times. This is just the ultimate gag. I saw this in a movie theater when I was a teenager -- I liked the poster, the cow with the boots -- and I was amazed. So many creative visual ideas, just to make you laugh. These guys were geniuses.
Sometimes you have an idea like this and you realize it's a nightmare to shoot. Like, come on -- we're not going to build a rolling train station. And they did it! When they were doing "Airplane!," "Top Secret!" and "Police Squad!" they were at their best. Everything is played straight, like it's a serious movie. Val Kilmer is perfect for the part because he's not supposed to be funny. It cracks me up every time.
I just finished my new movie, which is actually about Salvador Dalí. And the reverse scene [in the bookstore in "Top Secret!"] was in my mind. So we shot a few scenes reversed. Which is hilarious to shoot -- it's so much fun to do. And I know it came from "Top Secret!" because I've been obsessed for many years: Why would they do that? Why is it so good? Why?!
'10' (1979)
Director: Blake Edwards
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I have a passion for Blake Edwards, for this era especially. He has a very specific comedic timing. Nobody ever did the same pace of humor. And that's in this scene: the old woman trying to bring a tray. If I do it or if someone else does it, it will not be half as funny.
It's well-crafted. It's not something they shot just like that. For me the most important thing when I focus on a scene is the way the dialogue sounds, the music of the words. That's how I build my comedy timing. When a scene works well between actors, I don't chop it to make it faster or whatever. I keep the human pace. When it sounds like dialogue, like it's written, then it's not good enough. Even if they're saying stupid stuff, it has to sound like it's real.
'Raising Arizona' (1987)
Director: Joel Coen
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I've been in love with this movie. This one is more for the brilliant filmmaking: the way it's shot, the way it's cut, the way they use the music, the way they use the crane, the Steadicam. Every technique! Hand-held cameras, wide angles. The Coen brothers at this period had crazy filmmaking. I saw this on TV when I was a kid and it killed me.
For example, when Nicolas Cage exits the store and hears the cop, the camera does something. I think it's someone running in with the camera, hand-held. And it's amazing, the feeling you get, just by the fact that it's shaky. I tried to do this many times without success, because it's not my thing. I love "Fargo," too. A masterpiece. It's a nightmare when you look at the main character's point of view. And for some reason, that's enjoyable to watch!
'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' (1975)
Directors: Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
My mind exploded. What the hell -- is it possible to film this? Probably my taste for gory scenes and blood -- stupid blood -- comes from Monty Python. They became popular in France through the movies. I have to say [the French TV show] "Les Nuls" was the first bible for us as kids. We realized later that they were highly influenced by Monty Python, the Zucker brothers and stuff like that. But we didn't know and it was amazing to discover this crazy new comedy. They were basically translating these English-speaking codes to a French audience. They did a five-hour parody program called "TVN 595" -- crazy TV! It was freedom. You could tell they had no rules.

LIV Schism's Effect on Rankings Has Events Lost in the Weeds, Too: [Sports Desk]

Author: Blinder, Alan

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Official World Golf Ranking is a dividing line between LIV Golf and the sport's establishment. Since the metric helps determine access to major tournaments, the argument is hardly academic.
AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Since he stepped into a tee box near London last June, Dustin Johnson has earned at least $ 36 million in prize money, the most of any golfer in the world.
He has also seen his standing in the Official World Golf Ranking plunge, from No. 15 to No. 69.
Less than three years after his Masters Tournament victory, Johnson is hardly playing poorly. But his collapse in the ranking -- one he says he no longer bothers to monitor -- is a calculable consequence of his choice to leave the PGA Tour for LIV Golf, the league bankrolled by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund that debuted last year.
LIV has gleefully rocked men's golf and reveled in challenging some of the old order. The circuit, though, is finding that its independent streak can go only so far, and it is seeking at least some favor and special dispensations from the industry's most hidebound gatekeepers.
Those allowances have not come yet. LIV asked to be included in the ranking system about nine months ago, but executives are still weighing its application, and players like Johnson are slipping in the formula-based standings since they are appearing in few, if any, events that award ranking points. In golf, ranking is not merely a matter of ego; for many players, it affects the values of sponsorship deals and serves as a crucial gateway for entry to major tournaments such as the Masters, which will begin Thursday at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia.
"They need to do something to figure it out because, obviously, we have great players playing over here, and we're not getting any points for events, and we should be," said Johnson, who plays on the LIV circuit with the past major champions Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson and Cameron Smith, who, at No. 6, is the highest-ranked LIV player.
"They just need to figure out a system that's fair for everyone," Johnson, who spent 135 weeks at the No. 1, said in an interview last month, when he figured his play these days warranted a position around No. 5.
A potential affiliation between LIV and the O.W.G.R., which a handful of elite tours and governing bodies control, is being debated privately. But whenever a resolution comes, its ripple effects could shape LIV's allure to players and the majesty of the Masters and the other major men's tournaments: the British Open, the P.G.A. Championship and the U.S. Open.
LIV and its supporters contend that if the league's players are routinely excluded from major tournaments because of a spat over rankings, the reputations of golf's pre-eminent tests will erode and, in turn, public interest in the competitions will fade. The Saudi league's critics, though, are skeptical that LIV's 54-hole, no-cut tournaments should be readily compared to the 72-hole events that are commonplace on established circuits like the PGA Tour.
Players earn ranking points each time they compete in eligible events over a rolling two-year period. So as the months have progressed and LIV golfers have appeared in fewer sanctioned competitions, their banked points have declined, and they have slid down the list.
Bryson DeChambeau, the 2020 U.S. Open winner, arrived at last year's Masters at No. 19. He has fallen to No. 155. Koepka, a four-time major tournament winner who prevailed at LIV's event in Florida over the weekend, missed the Masters cut last spring but was No. 16 afterward. A former world No. 1, Koepka is now No. 118. Patrick Reed, the 2018 Masters champion, played Augusta last year ranked 31st; he now stands at No. 70.
"I think a lot of people are against them having world ranking points," Jon Rahm, the current third-ranked player and an occasionally fearsome critic of the formula, said late last year. "I'm not necessarily against it, but there should be adjustments," maybe, he suggested, by prorating the available points for 54-hole events.
But Rahm, a PGA Tour star, added of LIV: "They do have some incredible players. To say that Dustin wasn't one of the best players this year would be a mistake."
Bickering over golf rankings is not quite as old as the sport itself, but it hardly started with LIV's founding.
The system that became the O.W.G.R. debuted in 1986 as the Sony Ranking. Ostensibly created to sort the planet's best golfers -- the PGA Tour money list had been regarded as the most sensible measure of a player's fortunes -- the ranking was initially seen in some quarters as a glossy way for a powerful agent to elevate the profiles of his firm's clients. There was even a derisive nickname for the system: the "Phony Ranking."
Views eventually softened, and now there is little mistaking the ranking's widespread, if sometimes begrudging, acceptance, or its links to the golf establishment. Its governing board includes the leaders of the P.G.A. of America, the R&A, the U.S. Golf Association and some of the world's most elite tours.
The O.W.G.R. has said almost nothing publicly about LIV's application. By the end of last year, though, the ranking's technical committee had completed a review of LIV's application, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential process. The milestone shifted the application to another committee, this one including representatives of the major tournaments, to render a verdict.
The technical committee concluded that the new circuit easily cleared some of the standards for inclusion, such as sponsorship from a tour that may propose new members (in this case, the Asian Tour) and a commitment to abide by golf's playing rules. But the panel, according to people involved in the process, flagged what some members regarded as serious shortcomings in LIV's model, which some thought made it a "closed shop."
Officials fretted over the absence of an open qualifying school -- tournaments that can allow players to join a circuit -- before the start of LIV seasons, although league officials have argued that their "promotions" event suffices. And beyond the 54-hole nature of LIV tournaments, there were widespread worries about the league's reliance on 48-player fields, which are far smaller than typical for professional circuits, and concerns that LIV golfers' ownership stakes around the league could affect performances. Even now, skeptics note, LIV has not been around long enough to participate in the system.
But LIV executives and players have focused on a particular lifeline: that the ranking's most senior leaders have absolute discretion over admissions, including the authority to set aside any eligibility guideline.
The major tournaments that use the rankings as an entry method have similar powers and are not obligated to employ the formula in the future, but no organizer has even hinted at plans to abandon the ranking. Unless Augusta National, for instance, alters its protocol, many of the 18 LIV players in the Masters field this year could be left out as soon as 2024.
A handful face far less risk. In Augusta, many golfers and executives anticipate that past Masters winners will maintain their traditional lifetime privileges to play the tournament. But less renowned LIV players know that this turn at Augusta National could be their last -- unless, for example, they finish in the top 12 this year.
"It amps up the pressure," said Harold Varner III, who made his Masters debut last year but said he had accepted the possibility of being left out of future major fields. ("My goal over all through all of this was, what was best for golf -- and getting paid," he said.)
Even players who have proven capable of winning majors have confessed to fears that they could eventually be left out of some of golf's most venerated events.
"Augusta is one of the places where you want to play every year," said Smith, who, if the rules remain unchanged, will qualify for the Masters through at least 2027 by virtue of his British Open win last July but currently has no guarantees beyond that. "Until these rankings get sorted, it's definitely going to be in the back of my mind for sure."
He has, though, often resisted the urge to lash out in personal terms, even as his ambitions of reaching No. 1 have darkened for now.
"I made my bed, and I'm happy to sleep in it," Smith, who was reportedly promised at least $ 100 million in guaranteed money if he joined LIV, said recently on an Arizona patio. "But at the same time, I think there's an argument for coming to a golf tournament and knowing who you have to beat."
If Smith, or one of his LIV colleagues, wins at Augusta in the coming days, his ranking will surely soar. The Masters, after all, is an eligible tournament.

Siblings Vie to Nurture an Artist's Legacy: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Celia Bertoia's father -- the famous sculptor and not-so-famous musician Harry Bertoia -- had been dead 30 years when she asked a psychic how to handle his legacy.
The youngest of three children, she had long seemed to be her father's favorite: a confidante who, as a child, would cut his hair outdoors on their forest-fronting property among the idyllic valleys of Eastern Pennsylvania. But after his death in 1978, she dodged the family business of welding together mountains of metal into behemoth public-art installations and "sounding sculptures" that made music. She became a real-estate agent in Colorado, then the owner of a Montana service that provided timing for road races.
When she entered her 50s, Celia decided it was time to help manage the thousands of pieces her father had left. Her mother, Brigitta Valentiner Bertoia, had died in 2007. The next year, Celia consulted the psychic, who, knowing none of the back story, described "beautiful papers with abstract designs" -- which Celia took as a reference to her father's monotypes -- and his lung cancer.
"She said: 'The world is ready for these now. You should get these out,"' Celia, now 68, recalled in a phone conversation from the Utah office park that houses the Harry Bertoia Foundation, the nonprofit she started in 2013. "She gave me the direction."
Following the psychic's guidance reignited the childhood rivalry between Celia and her older brother, Val, who had spent much of the previous three decades restoring, appraising and emulating his father's sculptures in the workshop Harry established in 1952. Accusations of theft, forgery, avarice and betrayal erupted, prompting a bitter three-year lawsuit that led, in 2016, to the division of Bertoia's most fabled work: a centuries-old stone barn stuffed with nearly 100 of his so-called Sonambients, intricate but austere sculptures he welded from rods of beryllium copper and played like a virtuoso.
Many families struggle with issues of inheritance. But during the last decade, the Bertoias have learned how complicated those issues can be when that inheritance is unique.
"When I first heard the sculptures, I went, 'Wow, what is that?' Their suppleness is so inviting," said the composer Mark Grey, who captured their sounds with a mobile studio in 2002 to build simulacrums for the Kronos Quartet. "His sculptures leapfrog electronic music technology to create a different window into what we think sound is."
In late 2021, Sotheby's auctioned 20 of Bertoia's Sonambients (a rough portmanteau of sound and ambient) for nearly $ 6 million, prices that were in some cases ten times their estimates. Then Jack White's Third Man Records reissued the 11 rare LPs Bertoia had recorded in the barn -- recursive chimes that linger like church bells, powerful drones that roar like doom metal, tapped gongs that sing like seraphic choirs. The first pressing sold out in days. Last year, the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas hosted the first domestic Bertoia retrospective in nearly half a century. There, musicians including Nels Cline and Craig Taborn played the Sonambients in a series of concerts.
Those events were all partnerships with the foundation, part of Celia's efforts to send her father's work out into the world. Val, though, hopes to bring the world to the work. As children, they fought, and as adults, they have competing visions of their father's legacy.
"Celia and Val have the utmost respect for Harry," Lesta Bertoia, the oldest sibling, who excused herself from the lawsuit, said in an interview. "But they have never had good communication. Now they can make up one another's motives."
THE MORNING AFTER the Sotheby's auction, 100 miles southwest of Manhattan at the family home in rural Pennsylvania, Val Bertoia bounded around what he called the "Sonambient Barn" with a devilish grin. He swatted and swiped row after row of musical sculptures ­-- half of them made by his father, half by his own hand. The place shook with tectonic power, long southerly windows buzzing like beehives. His longtime partner, the artist Melissa Strawser, beamed.
The Bertoia family arrived in tiny Bally, Pa., at the dawn of the 1950s. Harry was an accomplished jewelry and furniture designer who had worked with Charles and Ray Eames. He'd taken a job at the modern design bastion Knoll, where he developed the celebrated Diamond chair. Then the sound of a bending wire captured his attention and fired his imagination.
During his final 20 years, Bertoia developed an army of minimalist sculptures with long rods that waved like fields of grain, producing tidal washes of luminous overtones or pointillist symphonies. He added a second floor to the hay barn, where his desk remains; the rest of the barn functioned as a giant resonant chamber, filled with a rotating cast of 100 sculptures.
"Being in the presence of those sounds brought me into a different world," Celia said. "He would move around the room like a cat. He knew those sculptures better than he knew his family."
Val began working for his father at his sprawling, cluttered shop in the center of Bally in 1971. Their relationship was sometimes strained, but Val said he internalized his father's methods. "Harry was my idol, my hero, my superman," he said.
After his father's death, Val tended to the business. He continued making sounding sculptures, incorporating whimsy, a quality he felt his father had shunned, and numbering every piece sequentially. (After 45 years, he is nearing 2,700.) Harry Bertoia acolytes accused Val of being a charlatan who plagiarized, charged for tours and inflated appraisals.
"I realized I could not replace Harry Bertoia," Val, now 73, said. "I had my own personality and discoveries."
This loose arrangement seemed to work until Celia launched her foundation. She'd been away from the sculptures for so long that she asked to shadow Val for two weeks, to get reacquainted with their dynamics and his own work. He agreed, then demanded $ 10,000; he admitted this was to scare her off. When Celia mentioned a few sculptures she'd requested years earlier, Val said they were gone. He'd split the proceeds only with Lesta, the sister who lived nearby. Celia hired a lawyer, battling Val over what belonged where until they settled in 2016.
Celia and Lesta received 73 of the remaining 92 Sonambients. Val kept the barn, their childhood home, the workshop, and the other 19 sounding sculptures. Val described the day he spent crating his father's sculptures as "emotionally swirling, like a hurricane." For Celia, it was "a knife in the belly." Lesta watched from the sidelines, telling them they were again behaving like children.
A DECADE AGO, Bertoia's musical legacy found an unexpected champion. John Brien is the owner of Important Records, a Massachusetts-based label that had documented the experimental recesses of international musical scenes for a dozen years, like harsh noise from Japan and New Zealand and graceful drones from England and Australia. He knew of Bertoia's chairs and even kept a photo of the designer above his desk. He was embarrassed when he stumbled on a link to Bertoia's music in 2012; how had he missed it?
"There was nothing I could compare it to," Brien said. "I wanted to know as much as I could."
Brien pitched the idea of a box set to the Bertoias, who consented despite the lawsuit. He began visiting the barn, where Harry's Sony microphones still hung, to collect photos, slides and sketches. Released in 2016, the 11-disc "Sonambient" was the first compilation of Harry's albums.
Brien has since emerged as one of Bertoia's most steadfast advocates, restoring and converting nearly 200 hours of unheard tape of music made on the sculptures. He has unearthed novel techniques within those recordings, including a primitive form of overdubbing. Brien said he can now identify several sculptures by sound alone.
Amid the turmoil, Brien strove to be inclusive. He solicited essays from all three children. The art historian Beverly Twitchell, who organized Bertoia's first two exhibitions while he was alive and wrote a definitive biography, contributed archival photos and guided Brien beyond the drama. And when the much-larger Third Man suggested partnering on a vinyl edition, defraying the massive cost of pressing such a large set, he agreed.
"I wanted to reach a new audience unfamiliar with this music," said Brien. "This was the way."
Brien's work suggests an ideal path forward for the Bertoia family -- partnerships, not divisions. But Celia and Val still seem hesitant to share resources, even while mounting exhaustive projects to document their father's work.
"Celia's goal is to gain money, where I have the goal of gaining people," Val said. (According to financial records, Celia has not drawn a salary as the foundation's executive director for several years.) "We have two different directions -- the foundation and the 'Soundation.' The Soundation is about how people can feel healed."
For five years, and with the help of Sotheby's, the foundation worked to sell 60 of Celia and Lesta's 73 Sonambients to a museum willing to build a new barn. Practicalities quashed the plan. Celia is now focused on a catalogue raisonné, a complete accounting of Harry's work. That's difficult to accomplish for an artist who never signed his creations, and harder still when a feud makes some of the pieces untouchable.
"The catalog will survive far beyond any of the siblings," she said. "It will ensure Harry's work will live on."
Val has filled the half-empty barn with sounding sculptures of his own, opposite his father's remaining Sonambients. Moving among them, he raved about the possibilities of what he called "the metaverse" -- an augmented-reality program that will allow anyone to visit the barn virtually and play. Brien had once floated the idea, but Val and Strawser pursued it when the pandemic shuttered in-person tours.
Grey, the composer, has started developing the program. It is not a question of technology, he insisted, but funding. "To see the barn in all its glory -- the microphones hanging off rafters, cobwebs all over them -- was remarkable, but time moves on," Grey said. "We have the opportunity to keep this art alive."
When Twitchell, the Bertoia biographer, learned the barn's contents would be scattered, she was sad. But practical considerations offset her disappointment. The aging barn has no security system or fire sprinklers, little parking or insurance. Even if the instruments are no longer in the same place, she said, they will at least survive.
"Harry would like the idea of multiple approaches to his work," Twitchell said. "No one would say 'this is the only way to think about this stuff."'

Technology Is a Player in Video Game Remakes: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New versions of Resident Evil 4 and Dead Space illustrate the challenges that video game developers face when immersing players in horrifying yet familiar worlds.
Die-hard fans wanted the floating spaceship of their nightmares, one stocked with mutilated zombies, improvised blowtorches and zero-gravity spectacles. The fictional engineer Isaac Clarke navigated this ramshackle vessel in Dead Space, the popular survival horror video game from 2008 that spawned two sequels.
But when developers at Motive Studios, a division of Electronic Arts based in Montreal, revisited the original for a planned remake nearly 15 years later, something was amiss.
What players remembered as terrifying seemed almost campy by modern standards because of technological advancements to graphics and artificial intelligence that have made gaming more immersive. The developers realized they would need to start from scratch, dismantling the spaceship, redesigning the zombies -- known as necromorphs -- and constructing new story lines.
"We don't necessarily want to recreate the game as it was, but like you remember it," said the remake's creative director, Roman Campos-Oriola, who previously worked on the Ghost Recon franchise. "That often means breaking stuff, which has a ripple effect."
Just as horror movies have been lucrative for theaters, nostalgia for the genre has benefited video game companies. A remake of the influential Resident Evil 4, considered by some to be one of the best video games ever, arrives on Friday, and a remake of System Shock, from 1994, is expected to hit computers in May. The Dead Space remake was the second-best-selling game in the United States in January, according to the NPD Group.
Horror remakes need to shock players in unexpected ways so they can't predict what is around the corner based on previous playthroughs, said Yasuhiro Ampo, the director of the new Resident Evil 4, which reimagines Capcom's 2005 release.
"One really big focus in development was to have respect for what people loved," he said through an interpreter.
"It's not only about making something prettier with modern standards for game graphics," he added about a game originally released for consoles like the Nintendo GameCube and Sony's PlayStation 2, "but to create that same feeling from when people played these games for the first time."
The tension in the Resident Evil franchise, about a seemingly unstoppable virus that has turned people into monstrous zombies, is amplified by its game mechanics. Enemies crash into the player's path at unexpected times, and the restrictive inventory system limits the amount of ammunition and healing herbs that can be carried.
Changes in the upcoming version include the removal of quick-time events -- which required players to mash specific buttons during cinematic cutscenes -- an innovation in the original that has grown stale through the years. More controversially, players will have the option to automatically sort their inventory instead of solving a Tetris-like puzzle inside an attaché case -- a minigame many found soothing.
The remake now allows Leon, the grizzled protagonist, to place unwanted weapons in storage and customize his case with colors and charms that add minor perks, like increased levels of healing. A durability system returns from previous remakes in the series, meaning Leon's trusty knife can break in the middle of blocking an enemy's attack, leaving the player defenseless.
Even the tiniest changes, however, are subject to criticism. After Resident Evil fans criticized a new rainfall animation seen in a preview video, Capcom said it was working on a patch to adjust the visual effect.
Sometimes, veterans from an original series are brought back to help navigate the challenges of a remake. Mike Yazijian was a young artist when he worked on the 2011 sequel to the original Dead Space; he returned as the remake's art director in his 40s.
One of the first changes Yazijian made was to the environment of the USG Ishimura, the marooned "gothic industrial" spaceship that holds horrible revelations.
"We upped the contrast," he said, explaining that the lights were there not only to illuminate the path but also to "make you feel like you're in a dentist's chair."
"The lights shine in the player's eye to make them feel uncomfortable," he said.
Yazijian went to extremes to remind players that his monsters were once people, trimming the zombies' fingernails to a square-cut shape to better resemble those of human cadavers. He also decided to shave their heads, removing the unsettling spindles of hair. "Hair is very expensive to animate in games these days," Yazijian said, explaining that getting the physics to behave properly is time intensive.
One of the game's most noticeable changes is only possible because of more powerful software: Players can fully immerse themselves in the haunting Ishimura, walking from one end to another without being buffeted by loading screens. The original required players to traverse between sections via a tram system.
For the game writer Jo Berry, the challenge of creating new story lines for Dead Space -- Isaac is notably no longer a silent protagonist -- was about elaborating on the original to enhance the game's immersive horror. She drew inspiration from the space thriller "Gravity" and the serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen's version, in the TV series "Hannibal").
"Narrative and gameplay should work together," Berry explained. "You don't want a rom-com when playing your dismemberment game."
Several developers behind horror games described their task like choreography, requiring precise timing and deft choices to deliver the terrifying experiences that players crave. The Dead Space remake uses an artificial intelligence program that employees named the Intensity Director, which can inject stress by generating enemies or creating ominous sounds when players' actions suggest they are feeling comfortable.
"We scaled it from 1 to 10," said Campos-Oriola, the game's creative director. "At 1, maybe a light will blink. At 3, maybe there's a creepy whisper in your ear. Based on what happened next, we might cool down -- or lure you into thinking it will be OK."
Artificial intelligence has been an important part of video game design since the 1980s. Among other games, sports titles like John Madden Football trained the computer to mimic the strategies of professional coaches.
More powerful technology has allowed artificial intelligence to become increasingly erratic and human. Enemies in Resident Evil 4 are zombified humans with their mental faculties still intact, and the developers wanted to make sure the evil villagers, called Ganados, were capable of planning their attacks in the remake instead of walking in a direct line toward players. The technology was also applied to Leon's companion, Ashley, who was a source of frustration: Enemies would easily topple her and she did little to resist unless the player intervened.
"In the original game, her character had a more systemlike approach where you had to check her health bar," Ampo, the director, said. "That was one more thing you had to check on all the time."
Now Ashley's programming allows her to avoid some attacks and hide behind objects. However, she will not be attacking the zombies herself. As the president's daughter, Ampo explained, she is not trained in combat.
When all these elements came together, the developers behind Resident Evil 4 felt like they had made a true remake of a classic game instead of a glossy imitation.
"We had created a tempo," the game's producer, Jun Takeuchi, said about the pacing of jump scares and zombie ambushes, "and had the epiphany that this was the game we wanted to make."

Full text: In the fall of 2020, Ilan Zechory stepped down as president of Genius, the annotation site he founded with two friends from Yale. After more than a decade at the start-up, he could have been forgiven for taking a break.
Now Mr. Zechory is hard at work again, though not running another zeitgeisty digital media site. Instead, the 39-year-old is training to be a psychoanalyst.
Five days a week from an office on the Upper West Side, Mr. Zechory helps his 20 or so patients -- some of them supine, in the classic style -- plumb the depths of their unconscious minds. Having gained an appreciation for the method during his own multiyear analysis, Mr. Zechory loves his new role.
"For the first time in my life I feel at peace with work, and have stopped dreaming about what else I should be doing with my days," he said.
Mr. Zechory is part of what may be a larger psychoanalytic moment. Around the country, on divans and in training institutes, on Instagram meme accounts and in small magazines, young (or at least young-ish) people are rediscovering the talking cure, along with the ideas of the Viennese doctor who developed it at the turn of the 20th century.
After several decades at the margins of American healthcare -- and 100 years after he published his last major theoretical work -- Sigmund Freud is enjoying something of a comeback.
Look and listen carefully these days, and you'll find Herr Doktor. For instance, the Instagram account freud.intensifies has more than a million followers and posts memes like a portrait of Freud overlaid with the text "Every time you call your boyfriend 'Daddy,' Sigmund Freud's ghost becomes a little stronger." In an April 2022 TikTok, which has been watched nearly five million times, a young man extols Freud: "Fast forward a hundred years, and he ain't miss yet!"
The magazine Parapraxis, which was started last year to "inquire into and uncover the psychosocial dimension of our lives," has attracted a progressive "new psychoanalysis crowd." The forthcoming film "Freud's Last Session," starring Anthony Hopkins, is currently filming in a reconstruction of Freud's famous Hampstead study, complete with antiquities. The Showtime series "Couples Therapy" documents several patients who see Orna Guralnik, a New York psychoanalyst and psychologist. "Know Your Enemy," an au courant lefty podcast, has devoted multiple episodes to discussions of Freud, who has become a frequent topic of conversation among the show's hosts.
And Opulent Tips, an influential fashion newsletter, referred in January to a "Freudian-core" aesthetic inspired by "the freaky underbelly of the 1950s," psychoanalysis' so-called golden age in the United States: "Looking the part. A crisp and correct surface with strange feelings boiling just beneath."
Plus, any culture that has just produced "MILF Manor" is going through something Freudian.
'You're Working With People's Fantasies'
In her 1981 book about psychoanalysis, "The Impossible Profession," Janet Malcolm interviews a pseudonymous analyst. "The insights of psychoanalysis are never taken for granted from one generation to the next," he says. "Each generation has to make the original discoveries afresh!"
Like anything formative from long in the past, Freud never totally disappeared. Some of his concepts, like denial and libido, are so deeply embedded in popular culture that we no longer even think of them as Freudian. And no young century that has canonized "The Sopranos," which featured many sessions of Tony's psychotherapy with Dr. Melfi, as well as episode-long dream sequences, could be completely devoid of "golden Siggie," as Freud's mother reportedly called him.
But today, the interest is more literal.
According to a spokesperson, the American Psychoanalytic Association, the country's main professional organization for psychoanalysts, doesn't keep data on the number of new analysts -- though its 3000 members, in comparison to the 106,000 licensed psychologists in the United States, give a sense of the field's niche status. But several prominent training institutes say applications are on the rise. And the Institute for Psychoanalytic Training and Research (IPTAR) says the number of sessions performed by its in-house clinic has roughly doubled since 2017, a sign that more people are seeking analytic treatment.
Violet Lucca, 37, the vice president of digital at Harper's Magazine, started analysis recently for two reasons. First, she is working on a book about the director David Cronenberg, whose interest in psychoanalysis yielded the 2011 film "A Dangerous Method," which dramatizes the relationship between Freud and his most famous follower, Carl Jung. Ms. Lucca thought going through analysis herself would be creatively useful. Second, in the last five years Ms. Lucca has dealt with the death of her mother, who she said was schizophrenic, as well as the end of a long relationship.
"I'm overdue," she said. (Ms. Lucca's analyst is Griffin Hansbury, who writes the widely read blog Jeremiah's Vanishing New York under the pseudonym Jeremiah Moss.)
Ms. Lucca said she hopes to become a little happier.
That could take a while. According to a 2022 paper in The International Journal of Psychoanalysis, a typical analysis lasts three to seven years.
But it's the length and depth of that conversation that drew Yelena Akhtiorskaya to analytic training. An acclaimed novelist (The New York Times called her debut, "Panic in a Suitcase," "brilliant and often funny"), Ms. Akhtiorskaya, 37, found her financial prospects as a full-time writer dim. (According to Tessa Peteete Ivers, chief operating officer of IPTAR, a first-year analyst could expect to make between $ 75,000 and $ 120,000 a year.)
So, inspired by an uncle who was a poet and an analyst, she decided in 2017 to get her license in psychoanalysis.
"As a literary person, what could be better than discussing dreams and symbols and delving as deep as possible four days a week?" she said. "I don't see why everyone isn't doing it. You are your own boss. You make your own hours. And you're working with people's fantasies."
Ms. Akhtiorskaya is part of a new cohort of people from creative backgrounds embarking on psychoanalytic training, a career change that would have been unthinkable in the heyday of the practice. The European émigrés who helped popularize analysis in the United States tethered themselves to the American medical establishment as a way of lending their method institutional legitimacy. For years, only psychiatrists -- medical doctors -- could receive analytic training.
Much of the field came to resemble, as Ms. Malcolm wrote, "a hidden, almost secret byway traveled by few (the analysts and their patients), edged by decrepit mansions with drawn shades." In this atmosphere, some wildly sexist, homophobic, and racist ideas, such as the notion that racial minorities were unanalyzable, flourished.
"Our politics of exclusivity have done us a disservice," said Kerry Sulkowicz, president of the American Psychoanalytic Association.
In 1988, a lawsuit opened up analytic training to social workers and psychologists. (In 2010, New York state began allowing people without mental-health training to pursue licenses in psychoanalysis.) But by then the field was already in a period of steep decline. The advent of modern psychopharmacology and the rise of short-term cognitive behavioral therapy made Freud's clinical legacy seem to many fuzzy, or worse, quaint.
(C.B.T., pioneered in the 1960s by an erstwhile Freudian psychiatrist named Aaron Beck, is considered the gold standard in treating anxiety and depression by many mental health professionals, with the strongest empirical support.)
Analysis is also notoriously expensive and time-consuming; a senior analyst in Manhattan might charge $ 400 an hour, which, on the suggested four-to-five day a week schedule, could easily work out to an $ 80,000 yearly expense that is only partly reimbursed by insurance. But many analysts work on a sliding scale, and some of the training institutes offer therapy for rates as low as $ 10 an hour.
The goals of analysis are in one sense modest -- Freud wrote, "much will be gained if we succeed in transforming your neurotic misery into ordinary unhappiness" -- but its claims about the operations of the mind are vast, and have drawn enormous skepticism. Karl Popper, the philosopher of science, famously criticized psychoanalysis as non-falsifiable, and therefore unscientific; Frederick Crews, an emeritus professor of literature at the University of California, Berkeley, made it the mission of much of his career to argue that Freudianism was so unempirical that it wasn't even a suitable basis for literary criticism.
"Freud's writings are full of ambiguities, so anyone who wants to find either positive or despairing implication in them can do so," Professor Crews said. "When propositions contradict each other, I regard that as a fatal problem. If you're just a casual reader and you come across sentences that you like, perhaps that suffices for you."
But some high-profile research has raised doubts about the science behind selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a class of medications frequently prescribed to treat depression and anxiety. And a younger generation has grown at least a bit skeptical about the way insurance companies and venture-backed mental health startups seem to favor cognitive-behavioral therapy, perhaps paving the way for this renewed interest in less symptom-focused forms of treatment.
Indeed, the idea that there are no magic bullets for mental health is part of what drew Mr. Zechory -- the ex-start-up boss -- to analytic training.
"I always had a sense that there is no free lunch, psychologically," he said.
'There's an Inward Turn Now'
Analysis, which is focused on excavating highly personal narratives of meaning over long periods of time, may seem like an odd fit in a culture that often embraces broad structural explanations for social traumas.
But Freud's ideas, according to a group of social-justice-oriented analysts, offer a way of understanding the unarticulated forces that create the social world and shape one's place within it.
"C.B.T. may help you with your panic attack today," said Dr. Beverly Stoute, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in Atlanta, referring to cognitive behavioral therapy. "But after you recover from your panic attack, you realize, 'Damn, this world is crazy."'
Dr. Stoute, who is Black, is a co-chairwoman of the Holmes Commission, convened in 2020 by the American Psychoanalytic Association to investigate systemic racism within institutional analysis in the United States. (Dr. Stoute estimates there are somewhere between 40 and 50 Black psychoanalysts in the United States.) The commission, along with work by the group Black Psychoanalysts Speak, and an influential 2016 documentary called Psychoanalysis in El Barrio, have argued that analysis is a powerful tool for addressing buried racial and class trauma.
"Psychoanalysis is the study of how we maintain not knowing what we know," said Matthew Steinfeld, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine. "And America is organized around not remembering what happened here."
Sam Adler-Bell, 32, a writer and the co-host of the "Know Your Enemy" podcast, started reading Freud during the pandemic, as Bernie Sanders's 2020 campaign foundered. He thinks that the left looks for Freudian explanations during times of defeat.
"There's an inward turn now," Mr. Adler-Bell said. "Maybe this purely materialist analysis of people's motivations doesn't give us what we need to make sense of the moment."
Nico Fuentes, a 32-year-old student at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, came to analysis three years ago, feeling emotionally stuck. She said she was turned off by the C.B.T. workbooks friends recommended, with their narrow focus on treating symptoms and quick diagnostics.
Ms. Fuentes was drawn instead to the intensity of traditional psychoanalysis. Her experience has left her convinced that the treatment has universal value.
"I am not bourgeois," she said. "I'm a working class, trans woman of color who began in analysis with very little understanding of analysis." "But," Ms. Fuentes argued, despite the longstanding perception to the contrary, "there is nothing fancy about psychoanalysis," just two people in a room, talking.
Then there's the matter of how we remember Freud himself. After decades of lacerating criticism over the sexism of concepts like penis envy and the theory that homosexuality resulted from abnormal Oedipal development, Freud came to symbolize for many the white, domineering, and pseudoscientific legacy of analysis.
"I originally read Freud as a teenager and thought, this is amazing," said Dr. Guralnik, of "Couples Therapy." "Then I came into all sorts of deep feminist critiques of Freud and started thinking, this is a whole bunch of patriarchal garbage. But having read a lot more and having come to realize that you have to see Freud in the context of his time, I came out on the other side. There are all kinds of Freuds. And you kind of pick and choose what Freud you want to have."
That people see what they want in Freud is fitting: The first psychoanalyst is still, more than 80 years after his death, a transference figure. As Sophie Kemp pointed out earlier this year in a piece for Dirt, the appeal of the Freudaissance for certain "downtown gamines obsessed with daddy" may be precisely that he has a retrograde and sexist image.
But some of the new vogue for Freud emphasizes his status as a racial minority in his native Austria, whose views on, for example, homosexuality, were nuanced and ahead of their time. A TikTok user recently discovered the famous 1935 letter in which Freud reassures the concerned American mother of a gay son that "homosexuality is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation."
"I don't know how the idea that Freud hated gay people got started," the fresh-faced TikTok user concluded, "But he did not. He absolutely did not." ("the more you know #freud #psychology #lgbt," he added in a caption.)
"When I actually read him, the things he was writing in the late 19th century are so much more progressive than most of America is now," said Ms. Akhtiorskaya. "To say that we're all polymorphously perverse, that we all have bisexual fantasies. It's modern."
And as for the charge that psychoanalysis isn't results-oriented, try explaining that to the moneymakers, who seem to see a return on the investment. One of the treatments Mr. Zechory offers is a hybrid therapy-coaching practice. His clientele: Start-up founders.

Ford Says Tennessee Plant Will Be Producing by 2025
Ford said Friday that its assembly plant under construction in western Tennessee will be able to build up to 500,000 electric pickup trucks a year at full output, part of the automaker's drive to produce 2 million electric vehicles worldwide annually by late 2026.
The company made the announcement as it provided updates on the so-called BlueOval City project.
Ford announced the project in September 2021 that would build the truck plant and a battery factory on 3,600 acres in rural Stanton, northeast of Memphis.
Ford's plant, and the battery plant run by South Korean battery maker SK On, will employ about 6,000 people with an investment of roughly $ 5.6 billion, Ford said.
Construction on the site is about 50 percent complete, said Donna Langford, Ford's project manager.
The automaker plans to start production by 2025, company officials said. The projects are expected to shift the Ford's future manufacturing footprint toward the South while putting an emphasis on green energy. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Position on Activision Deal
British antitrust regulators scrutinizing Microsoft's blockbuster purchase of maker Activision Blizzard on Friday dropped concerns that the deal would hurt the console gaming market, narrowing the scope of their investigation.
The Competition and Markets Authority said it no longer thinks the $ 69 billion deal will result in a "substantial lessening of competition" for console games in the U.K., an update to provisional findings issued last month based on new evidence.
The deal is set to be the biggest in the history of the tech industry. But it faces stiff opposition from rival Sony and is being examined by regulators in the U.S. and Europe over fears that it would give Microsoft control of popular game franchises like Call of Duty.
The purchase hit a hurdle last month when the U.K. watchdog said in its initial decision that the deal would stifle competition for both cloud and console gaming.
Based on the new evidence, the watchdog said it "would not be commercially beneficial" for Microsoft to make Call of Duty exclusive to its Xbox console.

SPACE TRAVEL
Bezos Rocket Grounded By Overheated Nozzle
An overheated rocket engine nozzle caused last year's Blue Origin launch failure that has grounded flights for six months, the company said Friday.
Jeff Bezos' rocket company Blue Origin said it expects to resume its trips to space from West Texas sometime later this year.
The New Shepard rocket was carrying experiments but no passengers when its engine nozzle broke apart because of excessive temperatures last September.
As the rocket started veering off course a minute into flight, the escape system kicked in and the capsule catapulted off and parachuted to safety.
No one was hurt and no property on the ground was damaged.
The investigation found that a design change led to the problem, which is being fixed, according to Blue Origin. The next flight will carry the experiments that were on the failed launch.
The investigation included the F.A.A., NASA and National Transportation Safety Board. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: A twisty MGM+ series tells the story of Kim Philby, a British agent secretly working for the Soviet Union, and Nicholas Elliott, his closest friend.
"Why wasn't he in custody?" asks the MI5 officer Lily Thomas. It is January 1963, and Thomas is talking about Kim Philby, a British intelligence agent who, after being exposed as a Soviet spy, has escaped to Moscow. Nicholas Elliott, Philby's closest friend and a fellow member of the foreign intelligence agency MI6, looks slightly nonplused. "Well, that's not how we --" he begins, before coming to an abrupt halt.
That "we" is at the heart of "A Spy Among Friends," a six-part series based on the book of the same name by Ben Macintyre, and starring Guy Pearce as Philby, Damian Lewis as Elliott and Anna Maxwell Martin as Thomas. The series, produced by Sony Pictures Television, premieres March 12 on MGM+.
It's the "we" of the old boys' club, of men bonded by private schools, an Oxbridge education, members-only clubs and the confident assumption of their right to power. The show explores the psychological shock of the realization that a figure considered "one of us" was something quite different all along.
"MI6 tended to attract those public schoolboys, people who had no hesitation about bending the rules because they thought they were above the rules," Macintyre said in a recent interview. "They believed they were born to lead, and they couldn't imagine that one of their own could be a traitor."
The TV adaptation was written by Alex Cary ("Homeland") and directed by Nick Murphy ("Blood"). Like the book, it is both a tale of espionage and the story of a friendship and a betrayal that is as personally devastating for Elliott as the political betrayal is for the Western powers.
Philby's story is true: He was one of the Cambridge Five, a group of upper-class Englishmen recruited by the Soviets while in college, and who were eventually, and gradually, unmasked following World War II, after they had been working for the Communist cause from inside British intelligence services for decades.
"It's such a well-known story in the U.K., Philby as the most successful traitor of the 20th century," Lewis said in a video interview from New York. "This is a sneak peek at a more psychological, emotional way of looking at it."
Philby was both Elliott's best friend and his idol, Lewis said, and Elliott "fatally continued to facilitate his treachery." Lewis added: "The great tragedy is that he realizes in retrospect that the man he loved and enabled and defended had gotten thousands of people killed."
Macintyre said that he learned about the Philby-Elliott friendship from the novelist John le Carré, who described it to him as "the best unwritten story of the Cold War." When he began his research, he discovered "comrades in arms who loved each other as much as heterosexual men in Britain could."
"It's a very intimate treachery," Macintyre said.
The book, full of biographical detail and historical context, wasn't easy to adapt, Cary said in an interview, adding that Lewis, whom he had worked with on "Homeland," helped him develop the script and the show's approach.
"We had long, long conversations about the balance between spy-narrative red meat and a story about friendship," Cary said.
He came up with the fictional Thomas, he said, as "a device through which we could engage with Elliott emotionally," and as an acknowledgment of the various women in Macintyre's book who are "involved in an unsung way." He added that he knew introducing a central female character to the story could "be called woke, which is fine with me!"
Thomas, with her northern accent and blunt manners, embodies the class differences between MI5 (which investigates matters of national security, like the F.B.I.) and MI6 (the foreign intelligence service, like the C.I.A.). But her character also suggests a redemptive path for Elliott, who gradually becomes aware of her qualities and potential.
"She represents what has to change in British society, but also has to play as a real person," Maxwell Martin said in an interview. Thomas is there, she said, "to serve a narrative -- someone who will cleave open Elliott's mind and his subtleties, his emotional brain and his heartbreak, and someone who would challenge what happened in Beirut."
Beirut, where both men had been stationed, is where the final confrontation between Elliott and Philby takes place. Cary uses their long, elliptical conversation as a central structuring device for the show, which moves swiftly and without any identification between countries, eras and story lines. "That allowed me to tip my hat to the le Carré 'Tinker, Tailor' genre," Cary said.
Anchoring the rapidly shifting scenes are conversations: between Philby and Elliott, between Thomas and Elliot, and between Philby and his Russian debriefer. And between these, there are subplots: a fictional one involving a C.I.A. plot in Moscow after Philby's defection, a true one about the identification of Anthony Blunt, the curator of Queen Elizabeth II's art collection, as another member of the Cambridge group.
"A key decision a director must make is the relationship between your camera and the story," said Murphy, the show's director, discussing the story's shifts in time and location. In the show, "the camera reacts to everything, it doesn't anticipate, which allows the audience to discover everything as the characters do."
Murphy's London is a gray, monochrome place, full of brown-suited men and women who are constantly lighting cigarettes in dim rooms. "The era is often delivered cinematically as a tribute to the swinging '60s," Murphy said. "But the '60s hadn't swung yet; it was an England and a Europe trying to get off its knees after the war."
The Moscow that Philby escapes to is an even more drab city of slushy snow, long lines and drunks on the street. And although he is nominally welcomed as a hero, the K.G.B. is deeply suspicious that he has come to Moscow to spy for Britain.
Pearce said that Philby mostly remained an enigma to him, too: "Did he really want to go to Moscow, or take the offer that Elliott makes of a peaceful life in the country in return for a full confession? Would his ego have allowed him to become an ordinary person in England?"
While Philby's flight to Moscow, and whether Elliott was complicit in it, remain an important ambiguity, the central question of the show, Cary said, is "whether there was sincerity in the depths of that friendship, even as there was duplicity in the great arc of the friendship."
That is also the essential question for Elliott, played by Lewis with a fine-tuned opacity that occasionally cracks to reveal the pain beneath.
"It is like a love story," Lewis said. "He feels like the cuckold who gave everything blindly to the relationship without knowing he has been cheated on."
Midway through the first episode of the series, Murphy recreates the televised news conference that Philby gave after he was accused of being the "third man" in a Communist spy ring that included his fellow Cambridge student Guy Burgess. Asked whether he still regarded Burgess as a friend, Philby hesitates, then gives an answer that is perhaps the one sincere sentiment he expresses in the show:
"On the subject of friendship," he says slowly, "I'd prefer to say as little as possible, because it's very complicated."

Ambition Without Apology: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The country singer and songwriter has long tested Nashville's boundaries while revealing herself to her listeners. Touring behind a recent album and a surprise EP, she's finding new heights.
Ever since Kelsea Ballerini saw Shania Twain soar into a theater on a flying motorcycle wearing a catsuit and closer-to-God hair, the rising country star has known she wanted to be a boundary-breaking daredevil. But, like Kelly Clarkson, she also wanted to be a bare-it-all open book -- hitting the big notes and still cracking self-effacing jokes onstage in jeans and a T-shirt.
On Ballerini's latest tour, she's got the glittery jumpsuit and the denim, the vulnerability -- and the push she needed to lift off.
Ballerini's set includes upbeat, pop-inflected songs from her fourth album, "Subject to Change" from 2022, and adroitly crafted hits from her early days, like "Peter Pan" and "Love Me Like You Mean It," that put her on the map in Nashville as a sassy young talent. But new heartbreak anthems from "Rolling Up the Welcome Mat," a spare, emotional EP she dropped in February, after she went through a high-profile divorce from the Australian country singer Morgan Evans, supercharged the show. Fans full-throatedly sang along, having memorized lyrics that were only out in the world for a few weeks, exhaling the release along with her. Ballerini gladly shared the mic.
"It's not about me singing the song," she said in an interview after the tour's recent opening date. "It's about us singing the song."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Over the past few months, Ballerini, 29, has entered new territory, including a potent performance on "Saturday Night Live," her debut there. The EP has intensified interest in her personal life, as she was photographed with a new beau (the actor Chase Stokes) and joined the popular podcast "Call Her Daddy" to describe, in full girl talk detail, the unraveling of her relationship with Evans, whom she married when she was 24 and he was 32. It wasn't easy to publicly air all this, Ballerini said, but "I don't want to lose the openness that I've always tried to have."
Where once the country ideal -- at least musically -- was to "Stand By Your Man," as Tammy Wynette famously put it, lately younger artists have been charting their wifely disappointments: Kacey Musgraves and Carly Pearce chronicled their respective relationships' demises, too. Operating in the wake of songwriter-performers like Musgraves and Maren Morris, who upended Nashville's traditional male tilt and pop suspicions, Ballerini is not coy about her career goals.
"I want to play arenas," she said -- which she is, on an upcoming tour with Kenny Chesney. But, she continued, "I want to be the main draw. I want the pyrotechnics. I want to cross over, dare I say."
It was a day off, between "S.N.L." and her tour, and Ballerini was cross-legged and barefoot on a chair in a Manhattan hotel room, her shearling-lined sandals tucked below. In forest colors and fuzzy corduroy sweatpants, she was cozy personified -- a star that seemed soft to the touch. She's a hugger, and an over-sharer. When I complimented the mane of blond hair beneath her pizza shop baseball hat, she explained that it was extensions.
"I lost so much hair last year -- just stress," she said. "It's growing back, in, like, little sprouts. It's a whole thing."
Then she laughed. "I could've just said 'thank you."'
Ballerini grew up in Knoxville, Tenn., the only child in a fairly religious household; she occasionally led the singing at worship service. Her rhythmic sensibility revealed itself early: Her mother has told her, she said, smiling, that even as a baby, she bounced along to music so intently that she would scoot her high chair clear across the room. At home, the stereo was tuned to Top 40 (thanks to her mother), and classic crooners (for her father).
"Any time I smell Bolognese, I hear Tony Bennett," Ballerini said, "because my dad would be cooking some beautiful Italian meal and blaring that all through the house."
Her parents split when she was 12 -- she used to bad mouth their divorce, she said, but now that she's gone through one herself, "I have a lot more grace for them" -- and she found a refuge in songwriting. "It's the truest love in my life," she said.
It helped her get through another trauma, when she witnessed the death of a classmate in a school shooting in 2008. By then, she had started voice lessons and picked up the guitar. She performed her first original song onstage at a recital in high school; she and her mother moved to Nashville when she was 15. "I just had this, like, stupid little knowingness," she said, that she would find her way in.
She filled her days studying tour documentaries and credits on CMT music videos, searching for names online to learn "who worked where, and what was a Sony, and who was a Hillary Lindsey," the chart-topping songwriter. By 19, she was signed as a songwriter herself, to the independent label Black River Entertainment, where she remains. Within four years, she was a Grammy nominee.
But being an artist with pop ambitions on an indie label has had its challenges, she admitted, and there was a learning curve to being a female artist in a field that's often hostile to them. She was 21, with her first Top 5 single, just after "Tomato-gate" happened -- the brouhaha over a radio consultant calling women merely the garnish on the scene -- and she suddenly realized how many yearslong gaps there were between female stars. "I was naïve and unaware," she said, "part of a conversation that I wasn't even ready for." For her last two albums, she has chosen more female collaborators. "It really freed up this new creative space for me," she said.
She makes a point to have at least one solo-written song on each project -- for herself, and for the industry. "I have this insecurity that because I'm blond and I'm glittery and I like production, that people don't take me seriously as a songwriter," she said. With the solo song, "The underlying tone is, 'Hey, I did this by myself. I didn't have a man in the room."'
Ballerini drafted "Rolling Up the Welcome Mat" mostly solo late last year, and finished and recorded it quickly, with just one collaborator. It came after Evans unexpectedly put out a single before their divorce was finalized last fall, claiming to be surprised at the breakup (his video is heavy on adoring female fans). Was her album a response to his track?
"Yes and no," she said. "I don't know if I would have written a song like 'Blindsided"' -- which checks off their troubles and uses the chorus, "Were you blindsided / or were you just blind?" as a retort -- "had I not been responding to something that was already out there."
Writing was a salve for her, she said, but she wasn't expecting the music, with glimmers of the hip-hop syncopation that have been her hallmark, to connect so deeply.
Alysa Vanderheym, a songwriter and producer whose credits include Little Big Town and Blake Shelton, worked with Ballerini on the surprise release. "She knew exactly what she wanted to say -- she had her titles, her concepts," she said in a phone interview. "It's so unfiltered -- she just went there, she didn't even second guess it -- which is so inspiring to me."
Ballerini was grateful, she said, that her label has never tamped down her ideas. In December, she called Patrick Tracy, the creative director she worked with on "Subject to Change," and told him that, surprise, she was about to release a new EP, and that she wanted him to direct a short film to accompany it.
Their timeline was brief, but Ballerini's vision was so clear, down to a shot where a stack of dirty dishes collapses, that she was credited as a co-director. "The story line from the very beginning was hers and hers alone," Tracy said.
"The way she rallies her team around her ambition," he added, "to me it's sort of unmatched -- it always feels collaborative."
For the EP, Ballerini said, she abandoned "the commercial country artist" part of her brain, the awareness of how things would fit into radio or playlists. The last track, "Leave Me Again," is just her voice and acoustic guitar, plaintive and hopeful.
"I feel really seen, and understood, as an artist right now," she said.
And she's getting a taste of what she dreamed of. "I have a little baby hydraulic lift on this tour," she said. "I think it brings me 10 feet in the air. And all of a sudden, my legs are, like, Bambi. I'm terrified. But I like it."

Full text: An 'American Masters' documentary follows Dr. Fauci, and Adam Sandler receives the Kennedy Center's annual comedy award.
Between network, cable and streaming, the modern television landscape is a vast one. Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Mar. 20-26. Details and times are subject to change.
Monday
INDEPENDENT LENS: STORMING CAESARS PALACE 10 p.m. on PBS. From the Emmy Award-winning anthology series Independent Lens comes a documentary about the activist Ruby Duncan, who led a grass-roots movement of mothers to fight for guaranteed income in the 1970s. After losing her job as a hotel worker in Las Vegas, Duncan joined a welfare rights group and, with thousands of equality activists, marched into the casino Caesar's Palace to disrupt "business as usual." The group challenged politicians and mob bosses, along with the beliefs of citizens through their protests and activism.
Tuesday
AMERICAN MASTERS: DR. TONY FAUCI 8 p.m. on PBS. The Emmy Award-winning series "American Masters" presents a new documentary on Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist. The filmmaker Mark Mannucci follows the physician over the course of two years, capturing Fauci as he confronts the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing political backlash. The documentary also gives a more intimate look into Fauci's personal life and provides a space for him to reflect on his 50-year career.
Wednesday
MARVEL'S THE AVENGERS (2012) 7 p.m. on FX. Based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, this epic film follows the heroes Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) as they are recruited to stop Thor's brother, Loki, who has gained ability to enslave humanity. To save the world, the superheroes must set aside their differences and work together. In his review for The New York Times, A.O. Scott wrote that "this movie revels in the individuality of its mighty, mythical characters, pinpointing insecurities that are amplified by superhuman power and catching sparks that fly when big, rough-edged egos (and alter egos) collide."
DIGMAN! 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. A new adult animated series created by Neil Campbell and Andy Samberg follows the washed-up celebrity archaeologist Rip Digman (voiced by Samberg) and his team of experts. Hoping to gain a reputation as "fearless adventurers," Digman and his crew face constant peril on their various excavation missions.
Thursday
THEY'RE WATCHING US: INSIDE THE COMPANY SURVEILLING MILLIONS OF STUDENTS 11 p.m. on VICE. At a time when an increasing number of students are being digitally monitored, a documentary by Vice News investigates Gaggle, a company that creates software meant to detect danger in the content created on school-issued accounts and devices. The film demonstrates how Gaggle has helped schools prevent tragedies through its ability to flag kids in crisis, as well as tackles the controversy of student safety versus privacy.
Friday
DR. STRANGELOVE OR: HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE BOMB (1964) 8 p.m. on TCM. Stanley Kubrick's Academy Award-nominated Cold War satire begins when Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) launches an unauthorized military strike against the Soviet Union -- an act guaranteed to start a nuclear war. President Merkin Muffley of United States (also Sellers) alerts Soviet authorities, and both militaries work together to prevent mutually assured destruction. In a 1994 review of the film for its 30th anniversary, Eric Lefcowitz describes it as an "icon" -- "the kind of movie that people can remember seeing for the first time."
I GO TO THE ROCK: THE GOSPEL MUSIC OF WHITNEY HOUSTON 8 p.m. on UPtv. This one-hour special, hosted by the Grammy Award-winning gospel singer CeCe Winans, focuses on the pop star Whitney Houston's faith and love of gospel music, and how those two elements impacted her personal life and career. The documentary follows Houston -- who died in 2012 -- from her first performance to her best-selling Gospel album of all time.
Saturday
ELVIS (2022) 8 p.m. on HBO. This Academy Award-nominated biopic chronicles the life of the rock 'n' roll star Elvis Presley (Austin Butler) from childhood to his death at 42, with the central plot focusing on his relationship with his manager for most of his career, Tom Parker (Tom Hanks). "There was never anything pure about Elvis Presley, except maybe his voice, and hearing it in all its aching, swaggering glory, you understand how it set off an earthquake," wrote Scott in his review for The Times, adding that "'Elvis,' for all its flaws and compromises, made me want to listen to him, as if for the first time."
Sunday
MARK TWAIN PRIZE FOR AMERICAN HUMOR 8 p.m. on CNN. Named in honor of one of the world's greatest humorists and given to those who have "had an impact on American society," the annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes an individual who has shaped the world of comedy. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts presents the 24th Prize to Adam Sandler, who in his 30-year career has become known for his loopy, lewd sense of humor and amiable charm.
SOPHIE'S CHOICE (1982) 10:30 p.m. on TCM. Based on the 1979 novel of the same name by William Styron, this Academy Award-nominated film follows the increasingly intersected lives of three residents in a Brooklyn boardinghouse in 1947. The aspiring writer Stingo (Peter MacNicol) meets the Polish immigrant Sophie (Meryl Streep) and her emotionally unstable lover, Nathan (Kevin Kline), and as Stingo gets to know Sophie better, he must parse fact from fiction in her stories to uncover what exactly happened to her at Auschwitz. "Though it's far from a flawless movie, 'Sophie's Choice' is a unified and deeply affecting one. Thanks in large part to Miss Streep's bravura performance, it's a film that casts a powerful, uninterrupted spell," wrote Janet Maslin in her review for The Times.

Melting Ice Is Music to Some Ears: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: As soon as Martin Sharp opened the file, he knew the ice had been singing all summer.
Several months earlier, Sharp -- at that point, in 2009, a glaciologist at the University of Alberta for nearly two decades -- had burrowed a cache of microphones into the Devon Ice Cap, a frozen mass in far northern Canada the size of Connecticut. Seven large microphones and GPS sensors monitored the rate of the melting ice atop the cap, while several seismic monitors sensed how the ice moved along the Earth, too. Almost as an afterthought, Sharp set up a little Sony hand-held recorder, hoping it might capture the essence of the frigid stillness where he often worked.
The result teemed with surprises: A snow bunting perched on the rig and sang. Gulls circled above. And below, as deep ice gradually thawed, an unexpected symphony unspooled. Water trickled past the microphone, creating a vertiginous drone, while tiny bubbles -- air trapped inside the ice, perhaps for centuries -- exploded incessantly, creating an allegro of snaps and pops that conjured the electronic productions of Autechre and Aphex Twin. Sharp began playing a 20-minute tape during lectures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change asked for a copy, hoping to add sonic context to dry discussions about data and policy.
"It gave people a different way into what I was talking about, other than just showing slides," Sharp, 64, said with a chuckle by phone. "The sound conveyed what it was like to be there."
In recent years, the assorted and unexpected sounds of ice have periodically gone viral -- the laserlike phenomenon of someone skating across thin ice, the shootout sensation of ice being dropped into a frozen hole, the meditative sighs of ice forming and popping inside a Swedish lake. But several scientists and musicians believe it all could have power beyond being mere online curios. Recordings of melting ice, splintering glaciers and cascading runoff could help predict the rate of climate change and sea-level rise; music made with such sounds, some hope, could lead listeners to rethink their relationship to nature. If more people can actually hear climate change through the once-unknown songs of failing ice, can they be inspired to help prevent it?
"I'm privileged that I can go somewhere and study these glaciers, but what about people who have to use their imaginations?" asked Grant Deane, 61, a longtime researcher at the University of California‌‌, San Diego.
Since 2009, he has plotted methods to use recordings of melting ice and calving glaciers -- chunks splitting from the monolith's edge above or below water -- to document and predict the rate of loss and concomitant rise of sea levels. The planet is in a constant state of flux, of course, so melting ice and calving glaciers are natural processes, with changing seasons or epochs. But the glaciers Deane studies are receding at a rapid rate he attributes to greenhouse gases, and he believes it's possible to hear that acceleration. He aims to build 12 substations along Greenland's coast to chart the attrition of the island's gargantuan ice sheet through sound.
Such science, he warned, held only so much possible public sway. "When people like me start talking about melting ice, it seems so far-off and unconnected from our everyday lives," continued Deane, who has contributed recordings to immersive installations by the Canadian artist Mia Feuer. "How can people care about that when they're dealing with immediate problems? Music can make those connections."
FOR NEARLY TWO decades, the Norwegian musician Jana Winderen has been at the forefront of transforming her straightforward recordings of glaciers and the land and water surrounding them into emotional records, poignant musical postcards from melting and cracking masses of ice. During a 2006 family vacation in Iceland, Winderen dipped a hydrophone -- a sealed microphone that detects pressure changes underwater -- under a glacier's edge. She shushed her daughters, sloshing in nearby mud, so she could tease out the source of some plangent rumble.
"It sounded like a loud engine, so I started looking for a tractor," Winderen, 57, said recently, speaking by video in her studio from her family's farm outside Oslo. "But I realized for the first time that the glacier is gliding -- really, really slowly -- on this water underneath sediments. And the sound has presence, like a creature. I totally fell in love."
A former aspiring marine biologist whose mother was an early member of the Norwegian environmental advocacy group Future in Our Hands, Winderen soon realized the transformative capabilities of such sounds. A photo of an iceberg, she recognized, was gorgeous; the brutal noise it made while breaking free from a glacier, however, could be harrowing. Even fusillades of tiny pops from escaping air proved evocative, as the frozen world gave way to heat. "People could close their eyes and be there with the ice, be present," she said. "It wasn't like I had just recorded something and brought it there."
Every time Winderen wields a microphone, the sounds surprise her. She can hear differences between ice that's old and young, inland or seaside. But she has never hoped to be a mere stenographer, simply playing back what she heard while suspended precariously in glacial crevasses or trying not to capsize off the coast of Greenland after icebergs hit the water. She processes raw recordings, turning them into extended collages. Her albums -- particularly "Energy Field" from 2010, which occasionally calls to mind drum-less heavy metal or an untuned violin -- unfurl as tone poems, giving her changing surroundings a spiritual gravitas.
"I am not archiving that sound or this sound -- that's not interesting to me," Winderen said. "It's more interesting to be out there and listen, to figure out what's happening and have an awareness of how much we don't know."
For the veteran Australian sound artist and researcher Philip Samartzis, it took an unprecedented Antarctic blizzard to accept the political potential of ice's songs. Samartzis first visited the continent, through an arts fellowship in 2010, to map the acoustic environment of the Davis research station, one of Australia's three outposts there. How, he wondered, did existence sound at this end of the earth?
"I tried to render the experiences as authentically as possible," Samartzis, 60, said by video during vacation in New Zealand. "So you have very detailed forensic recordings of the station -- without wind, which I was very adept at removing."
But, as Samartzis admitted with a grin, bowdlerizing wind from the breeziest place in the world wasn't very authentic. When he returned in February 2016, he intended to focus on wind itself, to log the ways it pulverized the place. He got his chance, during the strongest summertime blizzard ever witnessed there. As ice and snow pelted eight microphone stations through the 36-hour storm, the timbre of his work began shifting.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Though Samartzis often talked with wonder about the way the Antarctic ice would "sing," how dynamic and curious it always seemed, the roar he'd chronicled was terrifying, a bewildering testament to climate change's ferocity. His "Atmospheres and Disturbances," out in March, fastidiously presents the sounds of melting permafrost, contracting glaciers and human activity that seems to exacerbate both at a research outpost more than two miles above sea level in the Swiss Alps. Hearing the disappearance is haunting and hair-raising, like watching a television show about hunting ghosts.
"When I talk to scientists about climate change, everyone's all talked out. Essentially everyone knows, so it's, 'Why should I listen to you and your report?"' Samartzis said. "These recordings may not be scientifically sound, but it's a whole other way of communicating knowledge, a different aperture of experience."
Still, at least one pioneer of portraying ice through music worries that all this work arrives too late -- and that simply capturing these songs of surrender and playing them back through loudspeakers can never get to ice's might or grandeur. More than three decades ago, the young German producer Thomas Köner sat at the foot of a Norwegian glacier and marveled as fog rose and fell above it, like enormous frozen lungs breathing deliberately.
Between 1990 and 1993, Köner, who uses they/them pronouns, funneled such observations into a trilogy of lauded ambient albums that steadily evoked the awe and unease of being surrounded by ice that loomed, moved and cracked. But Köner believes that "Novaya Zemlya" -- their 2012 album inspired in part by the glaciers of the Arctic archipelago of the same name -- may be their final ice work. The Soviet Union tested the largest-ever atomic bomb there in 1961; for Köner, it represents humanity's true relationship to nature.
"This was the end of, if not the love affair, the loved object -- the idea of this pristine world of ice," Köner, 57, said by phone from an artist residency in Serbia. "It is very sad, like you lost somebody. But you keep going on."
Such presiding melancholy has motivated Eliza Bozek, 30, and a cadre of other young musicians to get to glaciers now, not later. An acolyte of the emotionally textured work of Winderen and Chris Watson (a prolific sound artist partly responsible for David Attenborough's "Frozen Planet"), Bozek thinks that allowing people to hear ice creates an opportunity for awareness and, just maybe, altered behavior.
"They're beautiful, but there's a slow violence to the sounds, too," said Bozek, who makes music under the name moltamole, from her Copenhagen apartment. "The sounds are political statements that are not available to our ears unless they're recorded. They create space for empathy."
LATE LAST YEAR, Sharp's 2009 recording atop the Devon Ice Cap, the one he played during lectures, enjoyed an unexpected reprise on an album called, simply, "Ice Records." The London artist and filmmaker Susan Schuppli first encountered Sharp while making a documentary about the Canadian Ice Core Lab, where more than 1,300 samples pulled from glaciers shape a portrait of Earth's climate history. He was the archive's first director.
Schuppli wove a portion of Sharp's file into a 24-minute collage of ice recordings she and other researchers had made around the world by climbing into crevasses or sticking hydrophones beneath a glacier's watery lips. The snippets are loud and vibrant, almost ecstatic, an atmosphere of ice offered with an exclamation mark. "I didn't want to treat it as a mute witness," Schuppli said by video from her home in London. "That sound gives us access to its change almost in real-time."
Toward the middle of "Ice Records," as meltwater gurgles beneath India's enormous Drang-Drung Glacier, several women laugh. In the village of Akshow, they'd depended on that water their entire lives; as the melting accelerates, however, they may be threatened by "outburst floods," when the water overruns whatever reservoir previously held it. But these women had never visited Drang-Drung, let alone listened to it. Schuppli led them up the ice and handed them headphones, so they might hear it morph beneath their feet.
"It was not about mourning this glacier but trying to understand what was going on," Schuppli said. "How does science produce hospitality, so it's not just scientists saying why their work is important? These women were enthralled. They didn't want to stop listening."

Twitter's Talks Over Licensing Music Stalled Under Musk: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Twitter didn't move forward with the music licensing deals because of costs, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Twitter explored the licensing of music rights from three major labels before negotiations stalled after Elon Musk's takeover of the company, said eight people with knowledge of the discussions, who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Twitter is one of the last big social media platforms without music licensing deals, which allow the sites to host virtually all commercially available audio content without fear of takedowns or legal reprisal. Facebook, Instagram and TikTok have all made agreements for music rights.
Twitter had avoided signing deals for music rights, which require social media companies to compensate rights holders when users post or play content with song. The costs of the licenses can vary, but can be well over $ 100 million a year for established social-media platforms. Twitter has forgone the licensing deals because of the costs, five former employees said.
Twitter and Mr. Musk did not respond to an email request for comment.
Twitter began negotiations with the three major music conglomerates -- Universal, Sony and Warner -- in the fall of 2021, according to six people close to the talks. When Mr. Musk announced his intent to buy the company last April, some music industry leaders saw his involvement as an opportunity to finally get the deals done.
"Twitter uses a significant amount of music but unlike all other mainstream social media platforms has refused to license that music or compensate songwriters," David Israelite, the chief executive of the National Music Publishers' Association, a trade group, tweeted at Mr. Musk that month. "Please help."
For the music companies, licensing agreements with Twitter would not only represent an additional source of revenue but also resolve longstanding problems of copyright infringement on the platform.
After Mr. Musk bought Twitter in October for $ 44 billion, talks continued as he flirted with the idea of challenging TikTok and resurrecting Vine, a once-popular short-video app that Twitter had bought in 2012 but shut down in 2016.
Mr. Musk's team was intrigued by the idea of adding music to the platform, and his personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, who has also represented artists including Jay-Z and Megan Thee Stallion, held meetings to understand the status of the label negotiations and assess the costs, four people familiar with the internal discussions said.
Mr. Spiro, who oversaw Twitter's legal portfolio during Mr. Musk's acquisition, left the company in December. He successfully defended Mr. Musk in a Tesla shareholder lawsuit this year.
The internal chaos at Twitter after Mr. Musk's takeover disrupted the negotiations, six people said. The company eliminated some of the people responsible for the music rights talks in several rounds of layoffs, leaving the labels with few remaining Twitter contacts, said four people at the major music companies who were briefed on the discussions.
Mr. Musk's team has also cut hundreds of millions of dollars in expenditures at Twitter -- missing office rent payments, shortchanging software vendors and eliminating a data center -- while requiring that every financial outlay be justified under new budgets. With those mandates, two people said, the company had little means to justify paying tens of millions of dollars to music rights holders.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After breathing a sigh of relief that the night went smoothly, our critics examine the acting wins as well as the track records of studios and Netflix.
It was business insistently as usual at the 95th annual Academy Awards , with the familiar dazzling smiles and designer threads, the showy glad-handing and flowing tears. What there wasn't was a slap sequel. Instead, this year's event went off smoothly, with regularly interspersed acceptance speeches from the team behind the fantasy adventure "Everything Everywhere All at Once," which scooped up seven golden statuettes, including best picture. The New York Times's co-chief film critics, A.O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, discussed the evening and the academy's carefully staged return to (fingers crossed?) a new normal.
MANOHLA DARGIS Bitching about the Oscars is a professional obligation (aesthetic as well as ethical!), but I have rarely been happier to be bored out of my mind than I was last night. As usual, I was disappointed and exasperated, but also occasionally amused and pleased. Mostly, I enjoyed how ordinary the evening felt with its corny jokes, gaudiness, desperation and self-congratulation. Midway through I realized that, mostly, I felt somehow reassured that life -- and the movies -- felt almost normal again, even with those weird Paxlovid ads and the honorable sight of Jessica Chastain briefly wearing a face mask.
A.O. SCOTT I can never quite remember who Jimmy Kimmel is and if I'm supposed to like him or not -- that was as true at 11:30 Sunday night as it was at 8 -- but he set and sustained an appropriate tone of affable normalcy. You knew he wasn't going to say or do anything too provocative or divisive or interesting, and that steady blandness reminded me of Johnny Carson, the generic white-guy Oscar host of my youth.
Youth was also one of the themes of the night. A lot of recent best picture winners have had fans, but "Everything Everywhere All at Once" is the first one in a long time that has a fandom. A great many people love this movie to the point of being obnoxious about it on social media, and its vibe of earnest, energetic, slightly cloying emotional openness was the evening's dominant vibe.
DARGIS Earnestness was an actual relief after last year's sad eruption of macho violence. The Slap dominated the 2022 show, obviously, and has permanently damaged Will Smith's profile. It was also a public relations disaster for the academy, which was already trying hard to persuade audiences that, two years into the pandemic, the movies were back. Kimmel is a skilled nice guy, or at least plays one on TV, and he handled the Slap's repercussions fine, mostly by just doing his job as he delivered innocuous patter and directed attention to all the shiny, happy, beautiful people onstage or in the audience.
Yet everyone who faithfully (hate) watches the Oscars knows that there's always a lot going on other than demigods doling out awards to one another or smiling for the hoi polloi at home. This year was no exception. For starters, Michelle Yeoh, the academy's first Asian best actress winner, was the evening's main front-row attraction. She wasn't smack in the middle of the first row -- she was a bit stage left with her "Everything" team -- but in terms of camera love and the crowd's reactions inside the theater, she was in the symbolic space formerly held by the industry's long-reigning royal, Meryl Streep, and before her, by Jack Nicholson. A new monarch was about to be crowned.
SCOTT The heart of the show was in the acting categories, each one of which told a kind of story Hollywood loves. Brendan Fraser (best actor) and Ke Huy Quan (best supporting actor) were comeback kids, each one returning to stardom after years away. Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis (supporting actress) were genre veterans and longtime stars basking in overdue glory. Thanks to "Everything Everywhere All at Once," the Asian and Asian American presence in Hollywood and in world cinema took center stage. It's impossible to be cynical about any of that, whatever you think of the movie itself.
On the other hand, there were those weird in-show commercials for Disney (or at least its looming live-action remake of "The Little Mermaid") and Warner Bros. (or at least its glorious history). Those are legacy studios with big, subscriber-hungry streaming platforms, and they clearly needed to remind viewers that they're still around. (They took home just three statues between them.) I wonder if Paramount, Universal and Sony, the other surviving studios with roots in old Hollywood, resented not getting similar attention.
And then there's Netflix, which paid for its advertisements and rode its war horse, "All Quiet on the Western Front," to four mostly technical awards. Still no best picture for that streamer, and another one for A24 (which gave us "Moonlight" a few years back). How do you think these Oscars reflect on the specter that haunts Hollywood -- the specter of streaming?
DARGIS First, I loved Jamie Lee Curtis and Michelle Yeoh's obvious adoration for each other -- truly.
As to this specter, well, I think that the academy by not giving Netflix what it wants so badly -- a best picture win -- once again delivered a conspicuous message to the streaming giant. Yes, Apple won best picture last year with "CODA," but Apple doesn't feel like a threat (to anything, really), unlike Netflix, which has consistently tried to bend the industry to its will. That company's enormous resources, its outsized power, aggressiveness and, I think, its contempt for theatrical releases -- and by extension, a foundational part of the movie industry itself -- have dinged its best picture chances, or at least that's what I hope. No one company should have such great power, whether it's Netflix or Disney.
The ascendence of A24 -- which was, as a reminder, founded by three guys from the indie-film world -- is certainly worth noting. But it's not surprising, given the direction that the remaining big studios have gone in recent decades. Companies like Disney make huge movies that, at least in the prepandemic years, scooped up huge piles of cash at the box office on their path to streaming. A24, Neon ("Parasite") and others often produce and release movies that remind audiences -- and the academy itself -- that motion pictures are not only about market shares and profits. These companies also get that audiences don't just want the same old, same old white faces and stories. Diversity is good for business and for art.
SCOTT Accepting the best picture Oscar, Jonathan Wang, one of the producers of "Everything Everywhere All at Once," said that "no person is more important than profits." He meant the opposite, of course, but his mix-up could stand as a Hollywood motto. The industry employs and exploits so many people, and every year celebrates a handful of those and the craft and creativity that make this business special.
You can't really separate the business from the other stuff, and it's best when the Oscars don't try too hard to sell the public on the magic of the movies or their cultural importance. In recent years, as ratings have slipped and cinema seemed to be losing ground to television, a note of desperation crept into the broadcast, an anxiety about the state of the audience made more intense by political dysfunction. This iteration was calmer and safer, and also maybe more confident. Movies are still around. People still care about them.
I certainly do, but this was my last Oscars as a film critic for The Times. Our morning-after post-mortems have been a highlight of the job, even if Oscar night itself has sometimes been a chore.
DARGIS Well, my friend, if I could, I would give you the biggest, grandest, shiniest "best comrade" statuette possible. It's been an honor and a genuine pleasure working alongside you through all the hits, the flops and the many Academy Award shows. My movie life and my thinking about what it all means onscreen and off, as well as my cranky Oscar post-mortems, just won't be the same without you.

Trouble With Interplanetary Travel: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Millions of years ago, a guy from another planet landed on this one. Like most survivors, he had a moody little girl with him.
To paraphrase an old Monty Python sketch, nobody suspects the Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinction.
Certainly the poor dinosaurs didn't, though for their more obsessive present-day human fans the fact that this movie is called "65" -- as in million years ago -- might count as a spoiler. When Mills the space pilot crash-lands on a muddy, reptile-infested Earth after his vessel is hit by an asteroid, you might have an inkling of the larger disaster in store.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I don't mean the movie; that would be unkind. "65," directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (two writers of the first "Quiet Place" film), is not interesting enough to be truly terrible or terrible enough to be halfway interesting. As Mills, Adam Driver does a lot of breathing and grunting as he runs a gantlet of familiar dangers. In addition to the T. rexes and other saurian menaces, he faces quicksand, large bugs, falling rocks, malfunctioning equipment and the withering judgment of a 9-year-old girl.
But let's back up a second. Who are these people, and how did they get to our planet before (if I may quote the opening titles) "the advent of mankind"? The answer is that they belonged to an ancient extraterrestrial civilization, one sufficiently advanced to have invented not only space travel, but the usual array of futuristic sci-fi technology.
Their health care system was pretty bad, though. Mills's adolescent daughter, Nevine (Chloe Coleman), suffers from a persistent, apparently life-threatening cough, and the only way he can afford her treatment is by taking on a high-paying "long-range exploratory mission." He's already grief-stricken when the asteroid hits, cleaving his spaceship in two and killing all of his cryogenically frozen passengers except one, a girl named Koa (Ariana Greenblatt).
The folks on their home planet, realistically enough, speak more than one language, so Koa and Mills -- whose native idiom is English -- can't communicate very well. Also, he's a grumpy, unhappy man and she's a moody girl, so we're on familiar survival-story terrain. "65" is a little like "The Last of Us," but with dinosaurs instead of mushrooms and no obvious sociological theme that would sustain a think piece.
Which would be to its credit, if it managed to be a simple, effective action movie. Or science-fiction movie. Or scary movie. Or something. Like Mills's emotional back story, the special effects seem to have been pulled out of a box of secondhand ideas. Nor is the execution all that impressive. There's little in the way of awe, suspense or surprise. Just a quickly hatched plan to get off this God-forsaken planet and leave it to its fate.
65
Rated PG-13. Dinosaur blood and prehistoric curses. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes. In theaters.

A Greek Drama That Encompasses Virtually Everything: [Sports Desk]

Full text: When the top teams in Greece meet, the story lines, and the rivalries, regularly extend far beyond the soccer field.
Olympiacos called it the Match for Peace. On April 9 last year, a little more than a month after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Greek club staged a friendly with Shakhtar Donetsk. It was a heartfelt, poignant sort of occasion, the first game Shakhtar had played since it had fled a war in its homeland.
Before the game, each of Shakhtar's players emerged with Ukraine's flag -- cornfield yellow, summer blue -- draped over their shoulders. Both teams' jerseys were adorned with the slogan: "Stop War." All proceeds from ticket sales for the game, held at Olympiacos's Karaiskakis stadium in Piraeus, would be used to help support refugees from the fighting. "We use football as a tool for peace," said Christian Karembeu, the Greek club's sporting director at the time.
Four days earlier, Alkinoos, a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of Liberia, arrived in Rotterdam from the Russian port of Primorsk, according to data from the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air and analyzed by Investigate Europe and Reporters United, a Greek investigative journalism project.
Quite how much Russian oil the vessel was carrying is not known, only that the ship's capacity is 109,900 deadweight tons, and that it is operated by Capital Ship Management. So, too, is the Aristidis, an oil and chemical tanker that arrived in Teesport, in northern England, a couple of days later. That ship, too, had come from Primorsk.
Capital Ship Management is owned by a Greek tycoon named Evangelos Marinakis. Though he has since diversified his holdings into media and retail, Marinakis can trace his fortune to shipping. That is where he made his money. It is in soccer, though, that he found fame. Marinakis is the man who turned Olympiacos into Greece's serial champion.
Marinakis -- also, much more recently, the owner of Nottingham Forest, now restored to the Premier League -- has not broken any laws, or defied any sanctions, by facilitating the flow of Russian oil around the world. The only transgression here, given Olympiacos's support for Shakhtar, was that his private and public stances did not match.
He is not alone in that. Giannis Alafouzos, like Marinakis, has a formidable portfolio of interests. He owns the SKAI television network, as well as Katherimini, Greece's leading newspaper. Both have been fiercely critical of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Alafouzos has maintained a similar stance in his (relatively few) public statements on the issue.
At the root of his fortune, though, is Kyklades Maritime, a shipping company with a fleet of 22 tankers that has continued to transport Russian oil in the year since the war began. Investigate Europe calculated that Kyklades vessels have "carried out 26 shipments of crude oil or oil from Russia internationally" between the start of the invasion and Jan. 5 this year.
Alafouzos, it should be pointed out, also owns Panathinaikos, traditionally Olympiacos's fiercest rival and its closest domestic competitor. In recent years, he has struggled to keep up with the juggernaut that Marinakis has built. Olympiacos, its revenues spiraling thanks to its frequent involvement in the Champions League, has claimed all but four Greek league titles this century. Panathinaikos, by contrast, has not been crowned Greek champion since 2010.
This year, though, it seems to have been restored. Under the astute coaching of Ivan Jovanovic, it sits 4 points clear of its nearest rival -- AEK Athens -- with only three games left in the regular season.
This weekend, though, brings its sternest challenge. Olympiacos currently sits third, 5 points back, but with a far deeper, more illustrious squad. It can call on the likes of James Rodríguez on Saturday when the clubs meet in Piraeus, at the Karaiskakis. Nobody will be describing it as a match for peace.
It is hard to capture the scale of meetings between Panathinaikos and Olympiacos. Perhaps the best way is to note that the game is known in Greece as the Derby of the Eternal Enemies, and that is probably underselling it. There is a case to be made that this has long been the most heated rivalry in Europe.
Between them, though, Marinakis and Alafouzos have managed what really ought to have been impossible: They have stoked it further. Greek soccer has for decades been dominated not by its players and managers but by its owners: proud, bombastic, fabulously wealthy strongmen drawn from the country's oligarch class, drawn to the sports less for the competition or the glory and more for the power it can bestow.
AEK, for example, is owned by Dimitris Melissanidis, another oil and shipping tycoon. PAOK, in the northern city of Thessaloniki, is a plaything of Ivan Savvidis, a Russian-Greek tobacco tycoon. Their clubs bring them a profile, provide them with a constituency, and offer a base from which to promote themselves and the interests of their empires.
As owners of the country's two most prominent and popular clubs, though, Marinakis and Alafouzos occupy the grandest stage. The friction between them has, at times, appeared to go beyond the professional and the commercial and into the deeply, virulently personal.
Alafouzos has previously sued Marinakis, among others, in relation to a match-fixing scandal -- and attendant wave of violence -- in which Marinakis was accused of involvement. He was later acquitted of all charges, and strenuously denies the accusations, painting them as a plot to discredit his success.
In return, Alafouzos's news media outlets have more than once been accused of breaking Greece's privacy laws in relation to Marinakis. In 2015, a meeting of the country's Super League teams had to be suspended after a "violent" altercation between the two men, which ended with one of Alafouzos's bodyguards nursing a split lip.
Quite how much any of this has to do with soccer is anyone's guess. Olympiacos, Panathinaikos and Greek soccer as a whole are, in all likelihood, caught in the crossfire of something far bigger than a mere sport. They are, instead, pieces in a game in which there is no time for morals, where any route to success is considered fair game, where a billionaire rivalry is played out not just on the field but in courts and ports, across the shipping lanes and the airwaves. There, the real prize is not a trophy but pure, uncontested power.
The PlayStation President
For a while, Pablo Longoria had a nickname. As the best nicknames do, it caught on because it worked. Longoria was young, but he looked even younger. And his route into professional soccer's executive ranks from Asturias, in northern Spain, had been unorthodox. He had honed his scouting acumen as a teenager by hours spent on various computer games. So they called him what he was: Niño De La Play -- The PlayStation Kid.
At one point, soccer would have held that outsider status against him. Now, though, there is no longer a tightly defined, strictly controlled entry policy to the game's backstage areas. Regardless of playing experience, any earnest striver, compulsive observer or slick charlatan can barge in the door. All it takes is enough persistence, self-belief and chutzpah.
Longoria's story suggests he has all of those in abundance. By his own account, he set up a website to analyze players when he was 12, which is both unusual and the most 12-year-old thing imaginable. At 16, he wrote to clubs across Europe offering his services. Newcastle United, one of three to respond, showed him the proper form for completing scouting reports.
He did not stop there. He got a job as an analyst for Recreativo de Huelva, a venerable, cash-strapped team in Spain's deep south. He worked for Newcastle, apparently, though it is not clear for how long and for what purpose. He built enough of a network to become a scout for the Italian side Atalanta.
By the time Longoria was 34, his résumé was positively glittering. He had been the head of recruitment at Sassuolo. He had been chief scout at Juventus and sporting director of Valencia before taking the latter role at Marseille. A little more than two years later, he earned a promotion: In 2021, he was appointed president of what is -- historically -- France's biggest club.
Beyond his experience, Longoria did not have any actual qualifications for any of those jobs. A few bad decisions and he might have been dismissed as a self-generated myth, his lack of a playing career held up as conclusive evidence for his failure. The entrance to soccer may be open to anyone, after all, but so is the exit.
That Longoria has only risen, then, is testament to the fact that he appears to be good at his work. Very good. At Marseille, he has recruited a mix of reliable Ligue 1 stalwarts, aging castoffs and promising youngsters, and placed them at the service of Igor Tudor, a manager whose appointment was so underwhelming that he was jeered by his own fans simply for taking the job.
But it has worked, and worked spectacularly. Marseille sits second in Ligue 1, behind the stuttering traveling circus of Paris St.-Germain. P.S.G. travels to the Stade Velodrome this weekend for France's great gala derby. Should Marseille win -- as it did against P.S.G. in the French Cup a few weeks ago -- it would close the gap to only 2 points. Nobody uses Longoria's nickname any more. Where he came from no longer seems so relevant. Where he is going is much more interesting.
State of the Union
Union Berlin was supposed to have fallen away by now. Ragtag stories tend, after all, to have a relatively brief shelf life. Unlikely teams rise to the top of the table in the early weeks of the season, as the superpowers are still limbering up. They are flooded with praise for their spirit and their tenacity and their derring-do, and then they slip away with good grace and happy memories of their time in the spotlight.
Union, it would appear, has not been handed that particular copy of the script. The Bundesliga is roughly two thirds of the way through its season, and Union -- the ultimate underdog, really -- is still there, battling with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, Union's opponent this weekend, at the top of the table.
The likelihood remains, of course, that in the white heat of the final stretch, Bayern (or possibly Dortmund, which moved on top -- temporarily -- with a victory Saturday) will have the players, the legs and the resources to leave the others behind, but the longer it goes on, the more of a boon it is for the league as a whole.
The Bundesliga has always insisted that Bayern's dominance is a good thing, not a bad one, no matter how counterintuitive that sounds and how wrong it very clearly is. But the mere possibility of Union's staying the course has energized the competition.
There is no such thing as romance in any major league now, not really. Competition, in the truest sense, is an illusion. There is a hegemony, an unmoving hierarchy, in every corner of Europe. But maintaining that illusion is in itself quite important. It does not matter, in the long run, if Union can stave off gravity. What matters is that, for quite some time, it has looked as if it might.
Correspondence
As ever, this newsletter seeks to strike a balance between the pragmatic and the philosophical. Joe Light's question belongs very much to the first category. "I've become fan of Wrexham since watching 'Welcome To Wrexham,"' he wrote, clearly unaware of my close personal friendship with Ryan Reynolds, to whom I recommended a museum in York.
"I'm intrigued by the long throw-ins by Ben Tozer, which have the effect of a corner and often lead to scoring chances. Why don't more clubs utilize this strategy?"
The answer to this question, Joe, is common decency. Well, a perception of common decency. Long throws were a familiar approach in the heyday of what I think we can all agree was the true beautiful game -- burly Englishmen booting balls as far as possible on mud-stained fields, their turf not so much mowed as plowed -- in the 1980s and 1990s.
After that, the idea became a little bit stigmatized. It has had something of a renaissance recently, though, thanks to the data-inflected, marginal gains philosophy of teams like Brentford, the Danish side Midtjylland and the Real Madrid subsidiary Liverpool. Ben Tozer may be a harbinger of the future.
Richard Lesser's question is similarly pragmatic. "Why are Champions League knockout games scheduled at the same time?" he asks. "It makes no sense from a television fan's perspective. Even if you record one game and watch the other, you still have to cloister yourself from hearing the other result."
There will, I suspect, be practical reasons for this -- kicking off one game earlier or later would impact match-going fans, after all -- but I would agree it seems a little outdated. It should not be beyond human imagination for the games to be staggered by an hour or so, at least.
Ken Bariahtaris, on the other hand, is contemplating weightier matters: "The beauty of soccer at this level is the narrow margins. Goals, fundamentally, are hard to come by. Skill, technique, money to build a side all matter, but tactics, effort, a magical moment or two can overcome disadvantages. Over a season, the aggregate talent rises. But we all love the possibility of a single game or tie making the difference." Scarcity, in other words, is soccer's secret ingredient.
And a point from Walid Neaz that already has been added, even before you read this, to my list of prospective subjects. "We're witnessing some of the best ever players for their respective nations in terms of appearances and goals: Neymar breaking Pelé's record, Messi and Ronaldo setting all time-greatest marks, the likes of Luis Suárez for Uruguay, Robert Lewandowski for Poland, Romelu Lukaku for Belgium, Olivier Giroud for France. Is this truly the generation where we're seeing players reach the highest heights, or is it helped by playing more games and competitions than ever before?"
My kneejerk, hot-take reaction is that the latter is certainly a substantial factor. Cristiano Ronaldo has scored a lot of goals for Portugal. Nobody is denying that. Nobody is devaluing his achievement. But it does seem like most of them came against Luxembourg, doesn't it?

Full text: The video game generated $ 850 million in sales in two weeks. Online discussion before its release was largely about the "Harry Potter" creator J.K. Rowling's comments on transgender issues.
The Hogwarts Legacy video game, set a century before the story of Harry Potter, has sold more than 12 million copies in two weeks, Warner Bros. Games said on Thursday.
The early sales figures for the role-playing game, which has generated about $ 850 million, come amid a revived debate over J.K. Rowling, the author who created the fantasy world and has drawn waves of criticism for her comments on gender identity issues.
Some critics who have called Rowling's positions anti-transgender -- a sentiment she denies -- called for a boycott of Hogwarts Legacy, which Warner Bros. Games has said she was not involved in creating. The back-and-forth over Rowling's positions grew particularly heated in the gaming community, where members tend to be deeply invested in online controversies and harassment can run rampant.
Although Hogwarts Legacy quickly broke one million concurrent viewers on the streaming site Twitch, some streamers refused to play it, and a few websites devoted to gaming coverage decided not to review it. Others sought to find a middle ground in which they engaged with the game while including caveats about Rowling or pledging to donate to L.G.B.T.Q. organizations. On forums dedicated to Hogwarts Legacy, the topic was front and center, with moderators seeking to tamp down talk about Rowling in favor of the game itself.
Elden Ring, one of last year's most popular role-playing games, sold 12 million copies in roughly two weeks. It sold more than 20 million copies in its first year on the market, its developers announced on Wednesday.
Warner Bros. Games, which has published games in the Batman: Arkham and Mortal Kombat franchises, said it was the company's biggest video game launch.
Joost van Dreunen, a gaming investor, adviser and New York University professor who studies the business of video games, called the sales numbers a "massive success," putting the game in the same league as blockbuster franchises like Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto.
"It is evidence of the appeal of strong intellectual property to mainstream gaming audiences," he said in an email, adding that the longevity of the game was in question because it is a single-player format, most likely leading some players to "burn through the content and move on."
It is not possible to determine whether online opposition to the highly anticipated game has affected its sales. The game has been released for computers, the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X and Series S and will come to the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch later this year.
The release of Hogwarts Legacy revived discussion of Rowling's views on transgender people, which have been scrutinized since 2018, when she liked a tweet that referred to transgender women as "men in dresses." In 2020, Rowling self-published an essay in which she said a movement of transgender activists was "seeking to erode 'woman' as a political and biological class and offering cover to predators."
Rowling has continued to be vocal on the subject, rallying against Scottish legislation that was intended to make it easier for people to legally change their gender.
Warner Bros. Games and the developer of Hogwarts Legacy, Avalanche Software, have avoided substantially addressing Rowling's comments. After fans concluded that one of the side characters in the video game is transgender, a representative for the developer told the entertainment website IGN, "It has been a high priority throughout the development of Hogwarts Legacy to create a game that is representative and diverse, aligning with our wonderful fan community."

Far From the Bolshoi, Starting Up Again: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: François Girard's staging, originally a co-production with the Bolshoi Theater, arrives a year after its Moscow premiere, which coincided with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"Let me adjust it," the conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin said to Donald Palumbo, the chorus master of the Metropolitan Opera, on a recent morning there. "I know how to adjust it."
Nézet-Séguin, the Met's music director, was running through the first act of Wagner's "Lohengrin," which opens in a new staging on Sunday. The score had come to a pianissimo -- immediately after the title character, an otherworldly visitor to a divided land, comes to the rescue of Elsa and declares his love for her -- and the chorus singers needed to alter their sound to accommodate the acoustics of their hooded costumes.
To the orchestra, Nézet-Séguin said, "I need this to be unbelievably soft." Then, to the performers onstage, he asked for more power, and in a sign of solidarity, flipped the cap of his hoodie over his head. "Maybe it's good if I do this," he added, to laughter throughout the auditorium.
It was one of many lighthearted moments in the rehearsal process for this new "Lohengrin," a production by François Girard that has otherwise had a difficult road to the Met. Developed in scattered homes and studios during the early coronavirus pandemic, it premiered last year in Moscow on Feb. 24 -- the day Russia invaded Ukraine.
Originally, the staging had been a co-production between the Met and the Bolshoi Theater, conceived for Anna Netrebko, the now-fallen star soprano. Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, flew to Moscow to attend a dress rehearsal; by the time he got back to New York, the invasion was underway.
In Russia, Girard had woken up on that Thursday in February, the day of the opening, thinking that war was a distant possibility. "I heard all the signs that it was coming, but there was also a common understanding that it was a bluff," Girard recalled. And he had been occupied with the looming premiere: Rehearsals had been repeatedly thwarted by the worldwide wave of Omicron variant infections (about half the Bolshoi chorus was out sick at any given moment); a skeleton staff of assistants; and the challenges of staging the first Wagner opera at the theater in nearly 50 years.
When Girard arrived at the Bolshoi that day, he was told about the invasion. There were tears in the theater. But the show went on, and was greeted by cheering ovations. It was a reminder, Girard recalled thinking, as Russians bowed onstage alongside Ukrainians, that "music and opera is one of those places where human beings meet."
"It is our modern church, our modern chapel," he added. "And at that moment, our chapel was on fire."
Girard left Moscow on Saturday -- a day earlier than planned. By Sunday, there were no more flights home. By Monday, Gelb had severed ties with Putin-affiliated Russian artists, and the new "Lohengrin" was in jeopardy.
Gelb backed out of the co-production agreement, a decision that, given U.S. sanctions, he said felt legally sound. "But," he added, "that didn't solve the problem of getting the scenery here. Even if we wanted to, the government wouldn't allow anything to come in from Russia."
The question was whether to move forward. The Met had a promising cast lined up already -- including the sopranos Christine Goerke and Tamara Wilson, along with the tenor Piotr Beczala as Lohengrin -- and had just announced its coming season. It couldn't simply revive its Robert Wilson production, a troubled, difficult one that hadn't been put on since 2006 and whose scenery had begun to disintegrate in storage. So Gelb decided that Girard's staging would have to be rebuilt from scratch, which would add over $ 1 million to the show's budget.
Now, Girard's production joins two other Wagner works that he has directed at the Met: a critically adored "Parsifal" from 2013 and a much less loved "Der Fliegende Holländer," whose opening night in 2020 was bedeviled by noise disruptions and technical problems, and whose run was quickly cut short by the pandemic shutdown of performing arts. (His "Holländer" will return to the Met in late May, revised by him, who in between "Lohengrin" and that production will also stage "The Hunting Gun" with Miki Nakatani and Mikhail Baryshnikov.)
Gelb has been working with Girard since the 1990s, when Gelb was an executive at Sony and Girard was making the movie "Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould." They later collaborated on "The Red Violin," with Gelb suggesting the composer John Corigliano to write a time- and world-traveling soundtrack to be performed by the violinist Joshua Bell.
During Gelb's tenure at the Met, which began in 2006, he has phased out nearly all of the older productions of Wagner's 10 canonical operas, which had been staged with old-fashioned naturalism and grandeur by Otto Schenk. (Even the replacements are beginning to be replaced, with a "Tristan und Isolde" coming soon from Yuval Sharon, and a new "Ring" cycle beginning in 2027.) So far, Girard's "Parsifal" has been the most successful among them.
And this "Lohengrin" is being treated as a sequel. Girard said that he sees all of Wagner's mature operas as "a grand fresco," and these two are more related than any of the others. "Lohengrin" was written long before "Parsifal" but takes place long after; Lohengrin is Parsifal's son.
During the glassy, ethereal Prelude of "Lohengrin," the moon is shown repeatedly rising, first slowly, then rapidly, indicating the passage of time. Although the scenic design -- a little bit "Star Wars" and a little bit DeviantArt, by Tim Yip, the Academy Award-winning designer of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" -- bears little resemblance to the "Parsifal" set, Lohengrin enters wearing the same black trousers and white button-down shirt of the grail knights in that opera.
"He comes from the other production," Girard said. "It's almost like we went down a hill, but we're still looking at the same sky."
Lohengrin comes, as well, from a more divine realm to save Elsa from persecution amid conflict and mercurial alliances -- between paganism and monotheism, between the Holy Roman Empire and opposing forces. To reflect the shifting allegiance of the masses, Yip has created hooded robes that, through precise choreography and with the help of magnets, can be configured to reveal an inner layer of red, green or white, colors matched to specific leaders.
This opera and "Parsifal" are also musically related -- particularly in their Preludes, Nézet-Séguin said. "It's the music of the otherworldly," he added. "It's something that's almost suspended in air."
But where "Parsifal" exists purely in the domain of the "immaterial," he said, "Lohengrin" alternates between the harmonic language of its title hero and the more earthbound music of the other characters. On Sunday, Nézet-Séguin will have conducted the two works at the Met; he said that while he considers "Parsifal" a work of genius, "'Lohengrin' is more relatable because you get the best of both worlds."
Existing somewhere between those two moods, too, is Beczala as Lohengrin. More known for the Italian repertoire, he took on this, his sole Wagnerian role, in 2017 at the urging of the conductor Christian Thielemann at the Semperoper Dresden in Germany; he had recently sung some operetta, and Thielemann told him, "There's not a huge difference from Lehár to Wagner."
Now, Beczala is singing in his fourth "Lohengrin" production, and his third new one. He said that he approaches the role by incorporating elements from others he has played. "There are moments," he added, "where I can get a little from 'Ballo,' or 'Rusalka.' The prince in 'Rusalka' and Lohengrin actually have nearly the same tessitura, so I can build on my experience."
For his part, Nézet-Séguin welcomes Beczala's sound. "He never saw himself as a Wagner tenor," Nézet-Séguin said. "But there is a luminous quality in his voice -- a lot of light, like sunshine. He can float it, but he can also bring in the heroic aspects. That's hard, and it's what we need for this role."
Nézet-Séguin believes that Beczala could even sing Parsifal one day. Hopefully, he said, it would be at the Met, which after Sunday will be capable of reviving Girard's "Parsifal" and "Lohengrin" productions in repertory, an idea that was already being talked about at rehearsals this week.
"To do these two operas together would be a real experience," Nézet-Séguin said. "This production is so well thought of as the sequel to 'Parsifal,' and I love this idea -- that you could be reading two huge chapters of the same story."

Microsoft Pushes Merger
With Activision in E.U.
Microsoft's Xbox video game division on Tuesday announced new partnerships with Nintendo and the chip maker Nvidia as it tries to persuade European regulators to approve its planned $ 68.7 billion takeover of the game publishing giant Activision Blizzard.
A key audience for the announcements were the European Union antitrust regulators who held a closed-door meeting Tuesday with executives from Microsoft and some of its competitors, including Sony and Google.
Microsoft does not have an agreement with Xbox's chief rival, the PlayStation-maker Sony, which has sought to persuade antitrust regulators around the world to stop the merger.
The all-cash deal, which would be the largest in the history of the tech industry, faces pushback from regulators in the U.S. and Europe because it would give Microsoft control of popular game franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush. The European Commission is scheduled to decide by March 23. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Mormon Church Is Fined
For Portfolio Actions
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its investment arm have been fined $ 5 million for using shell companies to obscure the size of the portfolio under church control, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced Tuesday.
The faith, widely known as the Mormon Church, maintains billions of dollars of investments in stocks, bonds, real estate and agriculture. Much of its portfolio is controlled by Ensign Peak Advisers, a nonprofit investment manager overseen by ecclesiastical leaders known as its presiding bishopric.
The church has agreed to pay $ 1 million and Ensign Peak will pay $ 4 million in penalties.
Ensign Peak avoided disclosing investments "with the church's knowledge," Gurbir Grewal, the agency's enforcement director, said in a statement.
Federal investigators said for a period of 22 years, the firm filed asset disclosure forms through 13 shell companies they created. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Tesla Changes Course
On Battery Production
Tesla has paused plans to produce entire batteries in Brandenburg, Germany, and will instead carry out some production steps in the United States, where tax incentives are more favorable, the Brandenburg Economy Ministry said on Tuesday.
Tesla originally planned to produce the full battery at the Germany site, with a peak capacity of over 50 gigawatt-hours per year. But with the United States offering tax breaks and consumer discounts to electric carmakers that produce batteries there, the company has changed course.
"Tesla has started its battery system production in Gruenheide and is preparing to manufacture battery cell components," the ministry said in a statement. "The company has prioritized further production steps in the U.S.A. because tax incentives make business conditions more favorable there."

Full text: In "Return to Seoul," a Parisian repeatedly visits her birth country. Neither the filmmaker nor the star were adopted, but they got help from friends.
Her biological father insists on buying her ballet shoes she does not want. She is repulsed by a tortured relative's overzealous dinner prayer and insistence on physical touching. When she visits her adoption agency, her eyes linger on pictures of smiling, happy parents and children.
But Freddie, a 25-year-old adoptee born in South Korea and raised in France, also grows up. She realizes that South Korea is "toxic" for her. And she goes back anyway -- with mixed results.
"Return to Seoul," a critically acclaimed drama that earned a place on the Oscars shortlist, has drawn praise for bringing forward a story that feels authentic to many adoptees and at the same time resonates with anyone who has ever felt a little lost.
The film tracks Freddie as she repeatedly returns to her birth country in a series of vignettes that play out over roughly eight years. Neither the film's writer-director, Davy Chou, nor its star, Park Ji-Min, were themselves adopted. Instead Freddie's journey is based on that of Laure Badufle, a friend of Chou's who is adopted. And Chou found Park -- an artist making her acting debut here -- through Erwan Ha Kyoon Larcher, a friend of Park's who is also adopted and gave input that helped shape the feature.
The director, actress and the friends who guided them recently gathered for a virtual discussion with me just days before "Return to Seoul" was released in theaters in New York and Los Angeles.
Here are edited excepts from our conversation:
Tell us a little bit about the origin story of the film.
LAURE BADUFLE Davy met my biological Korean father in 2011 when we were together in Korea. I asked if Davy could come because I was uncomfortable to meet him on my own. And we also had another friend do translation because I really needed to have a buffer. I always had this love-hate feeling about Korea and my biological family, especially on my father's side. There was this impulse and repulsion at the same time. I didn't talk to my adoptive family about it.
DAVY CHOU I was so naïve and light about it [the meeting]. It was kind of an adventure at first. Then, suddenly, to be at that table and see them -- I was being transported. It was a real thing, not an adventure. I didn't say anything. I was just observing. The friend was trying to translate, but I think it was a bit difficult because she had to figure out how to translate anger into Korean politeness.
I never told Laure that I had an idea of making a film. Just to be there was very different than what I would have expected of such a reunion. It was the mix of so many different things in the same time: sad, heavy, but also a bit funny -- in the way a tragedy can be funny.
BADUFLE It was quite unpleasant. I was expecting something much nicer. Deep down I think there was anger, and Davy was always soothing.
Then [about six years later] Davy came to me and said he wanted to work on the idea for his next movie. I was living in London. I just had this very crazy car accident where I almost lost my legs and I was recovering. When Davy asked me to do this, I looked into the documents. I wrote 30 pages. And I remember I was physically kind of emptying myself. I was crying. It was this kind of purge. There had been something inside. And I worried that if I let it out, it was going to destroy me. But because I was going to give this to him, who would have the distance to make something, I felt OK.
How did you get involved, Erwan?
ERWAN HA KYOON LARCHER Davy and I have a common friend who is also a movie director. We met maybe in 2012. He asked me some questions and talked about the movie he wanted to do. Then I spoke about Ji-Min. You know what happens next.
CHOU I wanted to listen to his experience. He told me a lot of his own story and a lot about his relationship with South Korea.
LARCHER Even if the film is based on your story, Laure, I just realized how much the situation is quite the same. The stories are different because we are all unique. But I went through the same steps. When I saw the movie, I could write maybe 90 percent of the dialogue. It was the same questions of communication and parents trying to reconnect through gifts and money or food. It was the same kind of time spent with Koreans -- drinking more than anything.
Ji-Min, what were your initial thoughts when Davy asked if you'd consider acting in a movie?
PARK JI-MIN My first thought was, "No way." The only thing I was interested in was actually the story of the movie. I am not adopted. I'm Korean, born in Korea and moved to France. But I also have some understanding of Freddie and what she feels. That was the only thing I was thinking was interesting. Acting in the movie was not at all in my ideas.
You are a fine artist by training, right?
PARK Yes. I do sculptures, installations. Paintings also.
So how did you finally agree to act?
PARK The moment I decided that I would give 100 percent of myself to the movie was the day Davy and I had a very long conversation. I told Davy I had some problems with some things in his script: the male gaze about a female Asian character and the image that a female Asian character has had in a movie. So we did change some things.
Laure, how did it feel to put what is ostensibly your story in the hands of two other people?
BADUFLE I was bit confused. Is this fiction? A documentary? And I was talking about something very painful. I went through some different stages: feeling like my story was used for some other purpose. But I trusted that Davy understood enough about what had happened with my biological family. I was sure he would make a beautiful movie.
It wasn't like you were texting him every day?
BADUFLE We had exchanges. But at some point I had to let go.
CHOU You had some feeling of fear.
BADUFLE I think only when I accepted the fact that the movie was the way it was, then I started to really enjoy and feel grateful and also take my place in this by organizing events with adoptees.
This movie process is helping me to grow with my adoption story. Like many other adoptees, I used to victimize myself and isolate. I didn't want to talk to others because they wouldn't understand. With time, I learned this is not the right approach. I have to say what I want to say. With the movie, I felt more legitimate.
Davy, Ji-Min, did either of you have reservations about making a film about adoption and not being adopted yourselves?
CHOU Doubt is always there. There is always the feeling that you might not make the film for good reasons or not be happy about it in the end because you haven't been faithful to the reality -- or the fear that people like Laure or Erwan will be disappointed. But I believe it's because of that doubt that you push yourself to try your best.
PARK The question of illegitimacy, I had it so, so strongly from the beginning and still now. There is another actress in the movie, Émeline Briffaud; she plays [a friend of Freddie's] and is adopted in real life. I met her twice before the shooting, and I was really, really afraid of her feelings. I felt so illegitimate in front of her. Why am I doing this? It's not my story or my life.
Laure, you were talking about how it felt like a purge. For me, it was also a purge, for my life, my history. It's really personal, but it was a motivation for why I did this.
CHOU There is dialogue where an adoption agency employees tells Freddie, "Maybe we have employees who understand the feeling of being an adoptee." For me, that says a lot. Making film is not only talking about yourself, but trying to make film about another experience. There is always a risk that you might miss it. But how close can I get to something, even if I will never be sure to touch it?
PARK It was a little bit easier for me when I understood that this was an artistic creation.
So, then, how was it possible to make a movie that is this authentic feeling?
CHOU For me, the authenticity has a lot to do with the details Laure shared with me. I couldn't invent the grandma touching Freddie's hair; the ballet shoes that the father offered. Also, with a lot of the Korean team, including Ji-Min, I was always asking about cultural details. [Chou is Cambodian and French.] How is the food served? How do people sit at the table? I also met adoptees and listened to their stories.
A lot of Korean adoptees were born in the '70s and '80s, so many of us have now come of age and are making art about our experience. To what extent, Davy, were you familiar with other movies or memoirs on Korean adoption?
CHOU I didn't know anything before meeting Laure. Even before deciding to make the film. I watched a lot of stuff on YouTube actually, small documentaries following an adoptee going to Korea for the first time. There are some reality TV shows -- crazy things that were very famous in the '90s -- where kids would come on and a smiley M.C. would say, "Hi, Do you want to meet your mother?" I read an amazing comic book; I read research by some scholars. But I also just like to hang out with Korean adoptees when I am in Seoul.
I kind of wrote this film in resistance to the classical story that was too simplified, a bit overwhelmed by good feelings. The stories were always sad of course, but at the end there is this call for easy reconciliation and peace. The story of Laure, the story of Erwan and the stories of the people I met were so different.
The film takes a longitudinal approach to Freddie, who we get to see in at least three stages of life. And, it's true, her life story does not tie itself up neatly.
PARK It is an individual story, but the power in it is that it becomes like a collective history even if, of course, all the stories are not the same.
Freddie is a lot of things and, like everybody, full of paradoxes and contradictions. Freddie is a real fighter. She fights every day in her life. And I fight. I fight as an Asian woman living in a French society. It was important to keep that fight in this movie.
For me, it was really important to show that Freddie is also a lost soul. But it's not at all a negative. I am a lost soul. I think we all have some questions that maybe we will never have the answers to. And the most important thing is the way we question ourselves about the world -- not find the final answers. The power of Freddie is that she keeps going on and on, even if she doesn't find the right answer or the answer that she would love to have.
Let me just ask this plainly: Laure, Erwan, did you like the film?
LARCHER The first time I watched the movie, it was too intense. I could recognize so many things about my own story. And to see Ji-Min, and to know Davy -- there were different layers. The second time it was a totally different movie. Of course I liked it, and I still like because it's very -- I don't know if it's the right word -- helpful for adopted people. I have other friends who recognize themselves. But it is much wider then just one story.
BADUFLE It's on this fine line of not saying but suggesting. It's beautiful.
I live with a sense of shame. For me, being adopted was a disability. I think adoptees feel proud of this movie -- that it exists, that they can talk about and that they can explain to others how it is to be an adoptee.

Do We Really Need V.R. Goggles?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sony's new $ 550 headset offers best-in-class virtual reality gaming, but it's still hard to see why we need V.R. goggles at all.
Ah, the "metaverse." Will a fantasy where our office meetings and social gatherings take place mostly in virtual reality ever come true?
As a tech critic who has worn almost every pair of virtual-reality goggles released in the last seven years, I've been holding my breath for a long time. And based on my testing of this year's first big hardware release in the metaverse category -- Sony's PlayStation VR2, which arrives Wednesday -- I've concluded that V.R. still has a ways to go before becoming a mainstream staple for work and play.
To be clear, the PlayStation VR2, priced at $ 550, is one of the best pieces of V.R. hardware you can buy. The curvy white headset plugs into the PlayStation 5 console, which is equipped with a powerful computer to run high-resolution games more smoothly; by contrast, Meta's V.R. devices, including its $ 400 Oculus Quest 2 and $ 1,500 Quest Pro, work wirelessly and rely on slower computing chips built into the headsets.
Also unlike Meta, Sony leans into the use of V.R. goggles only for gaming -- a wise choice because, so far, games are the most popular V.R. applications and productivity apps for taking video calls through headsets haven't gained traction.
Still, none of this is enough to make V.R. more than a niche, even as more brands, including Apple, prepare to enter the industry. That's because many of the problems people have had with V.R. headsets since the get-go -- including their off-putting aesthetic and high price -- remain for the PlayStation VR2 goggles. That being the case, I can recommend them to enthusiasts, but not to those who play the occasional video game.
Here's how I felt about virtual reality and the metaverse after a week of testing the PlayStation VR2.
V.R. has yet to find a truly killer app.
Why use V.R. for making video calls, streaming movies or playing games when the existing methods already work well? This is the perennial question surrounding the metaverse. Despite making progress with the technology, the new PlayStation goggles don't offer a clear answer.
The most compelling new game I tried was Horizon Call of the Mountain, a V.R. spinoff of the best-selling PlayStation 4 title Horizon Zero Dawn, a post-apocalyptic role-playing game. In the V.R. game, you control the character from a first-person perspective and can swing your arms to run around and climb mountains; you can also move your hands to grab an arrow from a quiver and shoot it with a bow.
It's a fun game with impressive graphics that show off the hardware's muscle, but in the end, I still preferred the gameplay and deeper story of the original Horizon Zero Dawn, which I finished years ago on the PlayStation 4.
Otherwise, a majority of V.R. games accompanying the device's launch that I tested were relatively old and uninteresting. Those included Star Wars: Tales From the Galaxy's Edge; Tetris Effect: Connected; and Moss, which were previously released for the older Quest 2 and first-generation PlayStation VR.
In general, the graphics and motion in the new PlayStation goggles looked clearer and smoother than Meta's V.R. products. Still, more often than not I found myself wondering why a game should be played in V.R. instead of on a television screen.
In the Star Wars game, where you take on the role of a droid mechanic, shooting a blaster at an enemy would have been just as simple using a game controller. The same could be said about Moss, where you control a white mouse in a 3-D environment. Tetris Effect: Connected involves rotating pieces known as tetrominoes, just as you would in any traditional Tetris game made in the last few decades; there was no clear benefit to playing this in an immersive environment.
Other games that will soon be available for PlayStation VR2, which I could not test, include big titles like Gran Turismo 7 and Resident Evil Village. Those are popular franchises, but both were released for traditional consoles in the last two years.
Gaming may currently be V.R.'s killer app, but if you want fresh and exciting games, the console-plus-TV combo is still king.
Headsets still look and feel weird to wear.
Since V.R. hardware started hitting the market about seven years ago, headsets have shed some weight. At 20 ounces, the PlayStation VR2 is an ounce lighter than its predecessor and five ounces lighter than the Meta Quest Pro. But all the goggles still felt too heavy. In my experience, I could wear them for no longer than 30 minutes before starting to feel neck strain.
Case in point: The PlayStation VR2 fell off my face and hit the ground when I was playing the Star Wars game and bent over to pick up a tool from the floor of a virtual space station. The wire plugged into the console also made the device feel more cumbersome than wireless headsets, and it created a tripping hazard in the living room.
And like all the goggles that came before it, the PlayStation VR2 looks pretty ridiculous. My wife couldn't resist shooting videos to mock me as I wore a headset that made me look like a character from the movie "Tron."
For storage, Sony includes a charging station to hold the motion controllers, which is convenient. But along with the headset, the product takes up precious space in a living room -- and unlike a laptop or smartphone, V.R. goggles instantly make a tidy room look cluttered. For single folks, I fear that the sight of the goggles would kill the chances of a second date.
The metaverse is lonely.
For the concept of the metaverse to succeed, we need to be able to connect with our loved ones in that space. In its current state, V.R. is still a mostly solitary experience. When you wear the PlayStation goggles, you block out your view of the real world. What you're doing in the game is shown on the TV screen that the PlayStation is plugged into. That lets others in the room follow along, but it's not very social.
Which brings up another issue: To have friends to play with in the metaverse, they must buy the same headset -- and the tech is still expensive.
When consumer technology goes mainstream, it typically becomes cheaper and more accessible. Despite being on the market for most of the last decade, virtual reality is heading in the opposite direction. At $ 550, the PlayStation VR2 costs $ 150 more than its predecessor -- and that's on top of the $ 500 you have to pay for a PlayStation 5.
Sony is not alone in the price creep. Last year, Meta raised the price of its best-selling headset, the Quest 2, to $ 400, from $ 300. Apple's headset, which may release this year, is expected to be a premium device that may cost thousands of dollars, according to reports.
So maybe one day -- when the tech is cheaper, has a truly killer app and doesn't make people look like weirdos -- we'll all hang out in the metaverse. For now, I'll continue to meet folks in person and online the old-school way.

Full text: A restored version of the film, which has returned to theaters, amplifies the ways in which it was groundbreaking.
A couple of years ago, for the 20th anniversary of the wide release of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," its director, Ang Lee, reflected on how he approached what became his unlikely masterpiece. When posed with the question of whether to center his film around fight scenes or drama, "I wanted it all," Lee told Entertainment Weekly. "Because of that, I didn't realize I was upgrading a B-movie to A."
Lee was, indeed, working with what, on paper -- a Chinese-language adaptation of an old serialized novel in the wuxia genre -- was a somewhat niche picture one wouldn't expect to make more than a blip at the American box office. Yet the film, released in December 2000, would go on to earn $ 128 million in the United States (or roughly $ 218 million today), according to Box Office Mojo. It became what remains by far the highest-grossing non-English-language film, receiving 10 Oscar nominations and winning four.
Memory, in a way, can diminish Lee's work, a whirlwind of revenge and romance that follows a mysterious young woman (Zhang Ziyi) who steals a storied sword from a master warrior (Chow Yun-fat). It tends to simplify the answer to how he created such a universal, sweeping epic, which has now returned to screens in a 4K restoration. What anyone who has ever watched the film will immediately recall, even viscerally feel, is of course those awe-inspiring action sequences: flight across terra-cotta roofs; the wordless sway of bamboo trees; the bodies that soared, glided, transcended.
Yet revisiting the film more than two decades later is to see that "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" was not just a very good martial arts movie that an American film-going audience, most likely unfamiliar with the genre, simply ate up. It was also everything else. Lee wanted it all and made it all, taking B-movie pulp and transforming it into a tragic fable, a feminist story of repression, a heartbreaking love story and a technically groundbreaking action blockbuster.
In a sense, those fight scenes, skillfully choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping, are but a metaphor in service to a parable of freedom and love. Jen (Zhang), the governor's daughter, knows only a life dictated by others; she can see only the truest version of a self in the weightless grace of combat, unbound by all constrictions. "Whatever path you take in life, be true to yourself," Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) tells Jen toward the end, a proclamation that proceeds the death of a love she never confessed to and presages the movie's wistfully elliptical final moment.
The line, though simple, strikes at the heart of the film's fable-like quality. It also might as well serve as the motto to Lee's oeuvre. Across a daringly eclectic career, Lee has tended to tell the same story -- from "Sense and Sensibility" (1995) to "Brokeback Mountain" (2005) -- just across wildly different genres: the human, bone-deep desire to live freely, to love who you love, to be unencumbered by culture, family and expectation.
Still, those fight sequences! Watching these scenes -- at once gritty and balletic, ferocious and majestic -- years later is to witness a bold cinematic discovery anew. For better or worse, the modern-day blockbuster is theoretically more grand, the battles and clashes on the scale of the planetary, and yet, when juxtaposed with "Crouching Tiger," they read as highly produced video game blurs. What a marvel it is to go back and see performance and personae so potently embodied amid seemingly impossible choreography. It is not even a question whether the stars did their own stunt work: The camerawork shows them too fully to ever wonder, their pathos and athleticism equally evident in each shot.
There's a litmus test here of Hollywood's changing ethos when considering that the film was nominated for 10 Oscars, but was completely shut out of all acting categories. The industry did not, and perhaps still does not, know how to fully see faces like these, in settings like these, speaking a language different than its own. This year's ceremony has a rejoinder in "Everything Everywhere All at Once," another Yeoh-led epic, which scored 11 Oscar nominations including, this time around, four acting nods, including Yeoh's first.
Watching Yeoh in both films, particularly within the context of the awards season campaign she's currently undergoing, is to see two bookends to the paradox that is her career. "Crouching Tiger" boasted great performances -- Chow's embodiment of stately elegance, a fire shimmering underneath; Zhang as the hotheaded protégé, unable to master the unruly greatness within her; Chang Chen, whose kooky charisma as Lo offered a version of Jack Sparrow years before Johnny Depp ever did -- but it was Yeoh who shined the brightest. And yet, her current "Everything Everywhere" victory lap has correctly framed her as a revered global star who only now has been allowed to fully extend her limbs.
Uniquely, reverence is the issue -- why couldn't she ever be anything more than the dignified figure she tends to cut on film? Another way to ask that is, what would have happened if her performance in "Crouching Tiger" hadn't inadvertently cast her in this unusual mold: refined, yet limited; regal, yet rigid; a graceful action star, but one that couldn't be harried, human.
Lee's film hinted that she could be all of it. For all of her sturdiness, her subtle, softened gaze throughout betrays her vulnerability. In the climax, as she watches her love die in her arms, her self-containment fractures. She weeps. She tells Jen to be true to herself, something she herself never could be.
Tragedy strikes like a one-two punch here. In the next scene, Jen returns to her own lover, Lo, a new life purportedly in her grasp. She asks him about the legend of the young man who jumped from a mountain to make a wish come true. Lo makes a wish that they'd return to the desert, and Jen leaps from the mountain. In the legend, the young man flies to safety. In Lee's parable of the governor's daughter, we don't know for sure. Or do we?
Even some two decades later, the gender politics of the film hold up rather well, striking a tricky balance in telling the story of women who are bound, but not shown through the terms of subjugation -- who get to fly even if they're not truly free. Their reality is often told instead in glances, silent moments when they recognize the isolation and alienation of lives beyond their own control.
By the end, Jen's fate has changed, but she is forever stuck. The film's enduring power is perhaps most potent in its poetic final moment: Human flight now translated into tragedy, one of a life that cannot be -- a timeless tale, Lee's trademark. After she jumps from the mountain, Jen floats across the screen, her eyes closed, at peace. She's finally free, swallowed by the abyss.

Full text: Our inaugural list of picks include films about a shell dealing with loneliness, an adventure from the archives of Jim Henson and a singing crocodile.
'Marcel the Shell With Shoes On'
Rent or buy on these platforms.
If you're one of the millions of humans who were charmed by Marcel when he made his debut on YouTube 12 years ago, it's time to introduce your kids to this tiny talking seashell who wears pink shoes, has a pet ball of lint named Alan, and is now lonesome and living in an Airbnb with his Italian seashell grandmother, Nana Connie (voiced by Isabella Rossellini).
The Oscar nominated film features Jenny Slate, who co-writes and voices Marcel, and Dean Fleischer Camp, who co-writes, directs and stars onscreen with the stop-motion shells. In the film, Marcel and Nana Connie have been left alone in the Airbnb after a human couple prone to shouting matches splits up and leaves the house. When we meet the pair, their entire family and community of shells has mysteriously disappeared along with the humans. Nana has "lost a small piece of a very large puzzle," as Marcel puts it. She's in the later stages of dementia, and the two of them entertain themselves by gardening, playing games and watching their favorite show, "60 Minutes." Camp moves into the house after a breakup and befriends Marcel at a time when they're both feeling a little lost.
The movie is about grief, loneliness and the importance of connection, so it might prove to be a bit cerebral and sorrowful for some children, but it's definitely worth a try. After all, there are adorable talking shells, and they use hot dog buns as couches. If the kids won't sit still for the full 90 minutes, maybe show it to them in little increments, bite sized, like Marcel.
'Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow'
Stream it on Disney+.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Based on a forgotten treatment written by Jim Henson and Jerry Juhl in 1968, "Turkey Hollow" was directed by Kirk R. Thatcher, an Emmy winner and longtime Muppets director and producer. It originally aired on Lifetime in 2015, and Disney+ is bringing it back this month. Henson's family discovered the treatment, along with a box of puppets and some pitch materials, in his archives. The result is an updated version of the original vision -- minus Jim Henson, of course.
The story is about a newly divorced father (Jay Harrington) who takes his children, Tim and Annie, to spend Thanksgiving at his Aunt Cly's farm. Cly is played by Mary Steenburgen, who can elevate material with one syllable of her Southern drawl. Tim and Annie are frustrated by the lack of internet access on the remote farm -- a plot point that would have seemed positively futuristic back in 1968 -- so they head into the woods, where they discover hints that a giant monster called the Howling Hoodoo isn't just local legend. They start tracking the monster, with the help of some new buddies named Squonk, Zorp, Burble and Thring. Meanwhile, the adults are enmeshed in illegal turkey scams, mild flirtations and rural squabbles. Will "Turkey Hollow" go down in history as one of Henson's most brilliant creations? That's a hard no. But it should entertain older toddlers who don't mind a few mild monster scares or young children who may recognize some of the Muppet-ness of the creatures.
'Extinct'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
If the history of the natural world had unfolded a little bit differently, Charles Darwin would have discovered some fluffy, talking, doughnut-shaped creatures called Flummels waddling around the Galápagos Islands. That's the premise of this 2021 animated musical tale. It's a film about extinction, time travel, courage and acceptance. It also features Terry Gross of "Fresh Air" as the voice of a ticking time bomb, a nod to any NPR-loving adults watching.
The main characters are Ed (voiced by Adam Devine) and Op (Rachel Bloom), Flummel siblings with very different approaches to life. Op is daring and tends to get into trouble; Ed is cautious and scared of pretty much everything. As the 150th Flummel Flower Festival approaches (complete with a Skrillex-looking Flummel D.J.), Op and Ed are cast out to a remote rock for causing trouble and forbidden from participating in the festival. When they try to redeem themselves by finding the island's most beautiful flower, they instead discover a vibrant bloom that causes them to time travel to modern-day Shanghai, where they meet a little white dog named Clarance (Ken Jeong).
The rest of the plot zigzags from Antarctica to Machu Picchu to the Great Wall and back again. There are musical numbers performed by a Triceratops, a Tasmanian tiger, a dodo and a Macrauchenia all singing cheeky lyrics about extinction like, "You can kill time here or time will kill you out there!" The plot is loopy, but it's tough to resist the charms of the voice cast, which includes Zazie Beetz, Catherine O'Hara, Reggie Watts and Henry Winkler.
'Hotel Transylvania: Transformania'
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Hotel Transylvania: Transformania," the fourth installment in the series, opens with a party to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the hotel and the retirement of Drac (voiced by Brian Hull). There's raucous singing and Day-Glo monsters, but Drac is radiating bad vibes -- he is not handling the transition to retirement gracefully.
The plot kicks off when Drac decides not to leave the hotel to his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez), because it would also mean leaving it to his skater dude son-in-law, Johnny (Andy Samberg). Johnny convinces Van Helsing to use his monster ray to turn him into a dragon-like creature, in hopes that his new green, spiked physique will endear him to his father-in-law. Things go awry when the ray turns Drac into a bald, potbellied human. It's a clever twist, revealing that for some, a dad bod and age spots are more terrifying than fangs and blood lust.
Human Drac and monster Johnny set off for South America in search of a crystal hidden in a cave that can reverse the transformation. There's a sweet campfire scene where the two finally start to bond and Johnny gets deep about looking for the good in others, using a roasted marshmallow as his visual aid. Maybe it will inspire your child to think about optimism versus pessimism, or maybe it'll just make them want a s'more.
'Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Academy Award winner Javier Bardem playing a singing, dancing showman, with an animated crocodile as his partner? That was enough to get my attention. Although it's not Bardem's finest film, it does make me wish he could have collaborated with Fellini on a movie or two. Small children may not care about any of that, though, so if you're looking for a silly, upbeat musical about a singing crocodile with stage fright (voiced by Shawn Mendes), stick around.
The live-action movie is based on the beloved book series by Bernard Waber. It tells the story of a boy named Josh who moves to New York with his parents (Scoot McNairy and Constance Wu), and discovers a large crocodile, the computer-generated Lyle, in the attic of his new home. Josh is a nervous child, and anyone who has moved to a new school or -- scarier still -- a new city, will likely relate to his worries and anxieties. Lyle helps Josh face his fears, and in turn he gets a buddy who defends him whenever humans say that crocodiles are dangerous.
Older kids might roll their eyes at the idea of a soft-shoeing animated reptile, but fans of the book series will probably be enchanted, as will children who love a good musical number that they can jump off the couch and dance to.

A British Musician, Finally Uninterrupted: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The British musician spent years writing for other artists. After speaking her truths about the industry, she shares personal revelations on her debut.
When the British artist Raye performed "Ice Cream Man." during a January concert at the cavernous Utilita Arena in Birmingham, England, many of the young women in the audience began to cry.
"Everything you did, it left me in a ruin/And no I didn't say a word/I guess that proves it/I'm a woman," she sang, her voice assertive, but with a quiver of vulnerability. The intimate, spare track recounts her experience of sexual assault, and was one of several unflinchingly personal songs in her set as the opening act on Lewis Capaldi's tour.
As she belted out "Escapism.," a collaboration with 070 Shake that earned Raye her first U.K. No. 1 last month, the crowd screamed the lyrics back to her. Even that track, which exploded on TikTok and recounts a nihilistic night out with glib humor, is "actually quite a sad song," Raye said, sitting in the bedroom she'd created on her tour bus after the show, a burning Le Labo candle nearby. But she chose to put the melody over "this fat beat with this fat bass," adding sirens, synths and strings, which "makes me feel powerful in my pain," she said.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Transforming her pain into power is a recurring theme on Raye's debut album, "My 21st Century Blues," which arrives on Friday, nine years after the 25-year-old musician signed her first record deal.
"When you think, 'I want to be an artist,' there are a few things you think of, the first thing being: album," she said. But waiting became as much a part of her journey as creating.
Raye joined the roster of Polydor Records in 2014, and in the subsequent years wrote on tracks for artists including Beyoncé, John Legend and Charli XCX. While she worked on her own music, she said that the label encouraged her to make chart-friendly dance tracks with D.J.s like Joel Corry and David Guetta, which she now believes pigeonholed her as "the girl who sings on dance songs" that she didn't even like. She wanted to create a body of work, but, "From a business perspective, they decided for me that I was this, and this was all I would ever be," she said.
Sitting in her tour bus in stage makeup and sweatpants, Raye recalled the moment in June 2021 when, as she was about to record a performance for N.Y.C. Pride, a member of her team told she wasn't going to be able to release an album with Polydor after all. "I freakin' lost it," she said. After bursting into tears, she wiped her eyes, recorded the broadcast and later posted a string of tweets about her frustration with the industry that drew loud support from other artists. Three weeks later, she announced that she had parted ways with the label.
A Polydor spokesman declined to comment on Raye's description of her time with the company, and said, "We've loved seeing Raye having all of this well-deserved success and wish her the very best."
Raye was determined to carry on. Last year, she signed a deal with the distribution service Human Re Sources. Its founder and chief executive, J. Erving, who is also an executive vice president at Sony, said in a video interview that Raye could have gotten more money upfront -- "the bag, so to speak" -- if she had signed with a traditional label. But instead she "bet on herself," choosing to release her album as an independent artist who owns her masters.
For Raye, creative control was the key to continuing in an industry that had nearly broken her down. "I'm not interested in being a 'singles' girl, it's the last thing I ever wanted to be," she said. For her, the album format is not about "selling records" but telling stories.
Raye (born Rachel Keen) has known what kind of artist she wanted to be from a young age. At 10, she was determined to attend the BRIT School, the performing arts institution known for famous alumni, including Amy Winehouse and Adele. Four years later, she won a place at the school, which is near the home in south London she shared with her parents and three younger sisters.
Raye said she was so devoted to her budding career, she gave up her social life to write music after school and on weekends with professionals she met through her guitar teacher: "I'd get the train up to whatever address in my calendar and I would go into a room full of middle-aged men and be like 'Hey, I'm going to write a song."'
Growing up, her Ghanaian-Swiss mother and English father "worked stupidly, exceptionally hard," she said, as a nurse and in insurance. Church, where her father played piano and her mother sang in the choir, was a big part of family life.
But Raye's private time with the records she loved inspired her to dream big. Every day after school, she would lie on the living room floor and play "The Diary of Alicia Keys‌," the singer's 2003 album, "like a religion," ‌she said. With its hip-hop overture, spoken-word interludes and vivid storytelling, Raye said "Diary" made her excited to one day write her own liner notes, order her own track listing‌ and tell people who she was through her music‌.
Raye's vision for her debut album began with its title. "I wanted to tell my blues," she said, which she defined as both a "12-bar phrase" but also "the stories on top." Heartbreak, so often a focus in pop music, was just one small part of the human experience, she added, and the album also explores disordered eating and addiction.
"As a woman, it's so taboo, and so unattractive, and so like, 'God, she's such a mess' to even discuss having a problem," Raye said. She described "Body Dysmorphia." as the album's most revealing track. "I'm so hungry I can't sleep/But I know if I eat/Then I'll be in the bathroom on my knees" she sings, her voice staccato over a trip-hop beat.
Making music out of hard truths has become as central to her mission as speaking them when she felt the industry was holding her back. And rather than using metaphors to keep such experiences hidden, Raye said it now feels "important to be honest about those things I kept in the darkness for so many years."
It may be therapy for her listeners, but it helps her, too: "I want to create stuff that will make me feel better."

Does the Best Person Always Win?: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite all the markers of excellence, contenders like Danielle Deadwyler, Viola Davis and Beyoncé weren't recognized for the highest honors. Niche awards don't suffice.
I didn't see it coming, but maybe I should have.
That refrain has been popping into my head repeatedly since learning that neither Viola Davis ("The Woman King") nor Danielle Deadwyler ("Till") was nominated for the best actress Oscar and that Andrea Riseborough and Ana de Armas had emerged as this year's spoilers.
It came to mind again on Sunday night when the Grammys awarded Harry Styles's "Harry's House" album of the year, not Beyoncé's "Renaissance." Though she made history that night as the most Grammy-winning artist of all time, this was Beyoncé's fourth shutout from the industry's most coveted category and another stark reminder that the last Black woman to take home that award was Lauryn Hill -- 24 years ago. This time the message was loud and clear: Beyoncé, one of the most prolific and transformative artists of the 21st century, can win only in niche categories. Her music -- a continually evolving and genre-defying sound -- still can't be seen as the standard-bearer for the universal.
The music and movie industries differ in many ways, but their prizes are similarly determined by the predominantly older white male members of the movie and recording academies. Though both organizations have made concerted efforts in recent years to diversify their voting bodies in terms of age, race and gender, Black women artists, despite their ingenuity, influence and, in Beyoncé's case, unparalleled innovation, continue to be denied their highest honors.
This trend is no indication of the quality of their work but rather a reflection of something else: the false myth of meritocracy upon which these institutions, their ceremonies and their gatekeepers thrive.
It is true that Black women, dating to Hattie McDaniel for "Gone With the Wind" (1939), have won the Academy Award for best supporting actress. And while it took a half-century for Whoopi Goldberg to receive an Oscar in the same category (for "Ghost"), over the past 20 years, seven Black women have won in this category, including Davis, and this year, Angela Bassett is a front-runner as well.
But, in a way, this is an example of rewarding the niche. What's being honored is a character whose function is in service to a film's plot and protagonist. She is neither a movie's emotional center nor primarily responsible for propelling its narrative. Such heavy lifting is why I think it made sense for Michelle Williams, whom many considered a lock for an Oscar for best supporting actress for "The Fabelmans," to campaign as a lead instead. "Although I haven't seen the movie," she told The New York Times, "the scenes that I read, the scenes that I prepped, the scenes that we shot, the scenes that I'm told are still in the movie, are akin to me with experiences that I have had playing roles considered lead."
In the past, academy voters might have said there weren't enough Black women in leading roles to consider. But "Till" and "The Woman King" disprove that. So we're left with other, more traditionally meritocratic arguments about who deserves to be nominated for best actress -- the quality of the individual performance, the critical response to a film, and a decent budget to market and campaign for Oscar consideration. Yet this year, even those measures suddenly seemed to be thrown out the window.
Instead, in the case of Andrea Riseborough's surprising nod for "To Leslie," we saw a new Oscar strategy playing out before our eyes. A groundswell of fellow actors, including A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet and even Cate Blanchett, who would go on to be nominated herself, publicly endorsed Riseborough's performance on social media, at screenings and even at a prize ceremony. Since only 218 of the 1,302 members of the academy's acting branch needed to rank a candidate first to secure a nomination, in time, that momentum translated into a nomination upset. That, in turn, led to a backlash, a review by the academy to make sure none of its campaign guidelines had been violated, and a backlash to the backlash, with Christina Ricci and Riseborough's "To Leslie" co-star Marc Maron calling out the academy for its investigation. "So it's only the films and actors that can afford the campaigns that deserve recognition?" Ricci wrote in a now-deleted Instagram post. "Feels elitist and exclusive and frankly very backward to me."
What fascinated me, however, was that what was being framed as a grass-roots campaign to circumvent studio marketing machines revealed another inside game. A racially homogeneous network of white Hollywood stars appeared to vote in a small but significant enough bloc to ensure their candidate was nominated.
And while that explains how an Oscar campaign can be both nontraditional and elitist, it also underscores the other obstacles that Black actresses, in particular, and actresses of color in general, have to surmount just to be nominated, let alone win. Gina Prince-Bythewood's "The Woman King" was so critically praised for its filmmaking and masterly performances and was such a commercially successful film that Davis was expected (at the very least) to garner her third nomination in the best actress category.
In contrast, Andrew Dominik's "Blonde," starring de Armas, was so heavily panned for its brutal and sexist depiction of Marilyn Monroe that I assumed the prerelease chatter about her performance would have dampened by the time Oscar voting began. For more than any other film with a best actress contender this year, "Blonde" raises the question: Shouldn't a protagonist have depth or multidimensionality for that actor's performance to be noteworthy? As conceived by Dominik, Monroe merely flits from injury to injury, all in the service of making her downfall inevitable.
Such representations reveal another pattern: Oscar voters continue to reward women's emotional excess more than their restraint. In most films with best actress nominations this year, women's anger as outbursts is a common thread. "Tár" and even "To Leslie" examines the dangerous consequences of such fury; "The Fabelmans" positions it as a maternal and artistic contradiction for Williams's character; and "Everything Everywhere All at Once" brilliantly explores it as both a response to IRS bureaucratic inefficacy and intergenerational tensions between a Chinese immigrant mother and her queer, Asian American daughter. "Blonde" is again an exception, for de Armas's Monroe expresses no external rage but sinks into depression and self-loathing, never directing her frustration at the many men who abuse her.
Within that cinematic context, I wondered if it was possible to applaud Deadwyler for playing a character like Mamie Till-Mobley. Unlike the main characters of the other films, Till-Mobley, in real life, had to repress her rational rage over the gruesome murder of her son, Emmett, to find justice and protect his legacy. Onscreen, Deadwyler captured that paradox by portraying Till-Mobley's constantly shifting self and her struggle to privately grieve her son's death while simultaneously being asked to speak on behalf of a burgeoning civil rights movement. If words like "nuanced," "subtle," "circumspect" or "introspective" garner leading men Oscar attention (how else do we explain Colin Farrell's nod?), female protagonists are often lauded for falling apart.
But even that assumes that all women's emotions are treated equally, when the truth is that rage itself is racially coded. Both "Till" and "The Woman King" depict Black women's rage as an individual emotion and a collective dissent, a combination that deviates from many on-screen representations of female anger as a downward spiral and self-destructive.
Commenting on such differential treatment, the "Till" director Chinonye Chukwu critiqued Hollywood on Instagram for its "unabashed misogyny towards Black women" after the academy snubbed her film. Likewise, in an essay for The Hollywood Reporter, Prince-Bythewood asked, "What is this inability of Academy voters to see Black women, and their humanity, and their heroism, as relatable to themselves?"
It's been over 20 years since Halle Berry won the best actress Oscar for her "Monster's Ball" performance as a Black mother who grieves the loss of her son through alcohol and sex. The fact that she remains the only Black woman to have won this award is ridiculous. "I do feel completely heartbroken that there's no other woman standing next to me in 20 years," Berry reflected in the run-up to the Oscars last year. "I thought, like everybody else, that night meant a lot of things would change."
The difference between then and now is that there are far more Black women directors and complex Black women characters on the big screen than ever before. Maybe, next year, the academy members will get behind one of those actors. Then again, maybe I should know better.

Scooter Braun's Hybe Buys Atlanta Rap Label: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The acquisition is the famed music manager's first major move at Hybe America -- a division of the South Korean firm -- since he became its sole chief executive last month.
Quality Control Music, the Atlanta rap label that is one of the hottest hit machines in contemporary music, has been acquired by Hybe America, a company led by the executive and talent manager Scooter Braun, in one of the most closely watched deals in the music business.
The acquisition is the first major step taken by Braun -- who manages pop stars like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato -- since he became the sole chief executive of Hybe America last month. The company is a division of the South Korean entertainment firm Hybe, which dominates the K-pop world through its management of the superstar group BTS.
The transaction was announced late Wednesday by Hybe America and QC Media Holdings, the label's parent entity. Financial disclosures released by Hybe in South Korea on Thursday indicate that the purchase price was about $ 300 million in cash and stock.
"QC is one of the most significant independent labels in the world," Braun said in a statement to The New York Times. "They not only distribute music, but they also distribute culture. Their artists are the voices of their communities."
The deal takes off the table one of the most coveted independent labels in music and expands the global repertoire of Hybe, which has only recently begun to look beyond the boundaries of K-pop.
Since its founding in 2013, by Pierre Thomas (known as P) and Kevin Lee (Coach K), Quality Control has been behind the rise of rap acts like Migos, Lil Baby and Lil Yachty. Early on, the label mastered the promotion of music through streaming, adapting the fire-hose-of-content strategy that had long flourished in the world of semiofficial mixtapes.
By early 2017, the label had scored a global smash with "Bad and Boujee," featuring the idiosyncratic, stuttering flow of the trio Migos, with a guest appearance by the rapper Lil Uzi Vert. The song spent three weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Lil Baby alone has garnered 37 billion streams of his catalog, according to Quality Control.
Thomas and Lee will remain at the helm of the label, under the direction of Braun, they said.
Braun became a power player in artist management after discovering a young Bieber on YouTube. In 2019, he came under the cross hairs of Taylor Swift fans when his entertainment company, Ithaca Holdings, bought her former label, Big Machine -- including the rights to her first six studio albums -- for more than $ 300 million, without Swift's participation. Ithaca later sold Swift's albums to another investor.
In 2021, Braun joined Hybe after that company purchased Ithaca -- which included Braun's management deals, music publishing assets and the remainder of Big Machine -- for just over $ 1 billion.
"We want to take our brand worldwide and need partners with mind-sets like ours -- ground up, self-made and building companies from nothing," Thomas, Quality Control's chief executive, said in a statement. "All of Hybe's leaders are entrepreneurs with track records for finding, growing and amplifying their talent globally."
One question hanging over the deal is the future value of Migos, one of Quality Control's biggest acts. One member, Takeoff, was killed in a shooting in November. A second, Offset, is suing Quality Control over ownership of his solo recordings. The third, Quavo, is managed by SB Projects, Braun's company, which is part of Hybe America.
Hybe's deal for Quality Control is the latest in a string of transactions in which big music companies have scooped up smaller labels known for their close relationships with artists.
In 2021, Warner Music Group paid $ 400 million for 300 Entertainment, which has released music by Megan Thee Stallion and Young Thug. That year, Sony Music also purchased a controlling stake in Alamo Records, whose acts include Lil Durk and Rod Wave; the value of that transaction was not disclosed, but is estimated at close to $ 200 million.

For Best Actress, The Best Brouhaha: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: You've got questions about the surprise best-actress nominee, and our awards columnist has the answers (and a few more questions).
The seismic Will Smith slap? The jaw-dropping "La La Land"-"Moonlight" mix-up? You can have 'em. I like my Oscar controversies like I like my "Curb Your Enthusiasm" plot lines: small, petty and a little bit deranged.
That's why I've been gripped by all the new developments surrounding Andrea Riseborough, who managed a surprise best-actress nomination last month that quickly turned from boon to boondoggle. It's the story everyone in Hollywood is talking about, though you'd be forgiven for wondering what exactly has gone down or why any of it matters. With that in mind, let's see if I can find the answers to your questions:
Who is Andrea Riseborough?
The 41-year-old Brit is a real actor's actor, the sort of committed thespian who is well-respected by her peers but has mostly flown under the pop-cultural radar. Without even clocking that it was the same actress, you might have seen Riseborough playing Nicolas Cage's wife in the hallucinogenic "Mandy"; seducing Emma Stone in "Battle of the Sexes"; covering up an accidental death in an episode of "Black Mirror"; or exploring a ruined Earth with Tom Cruise in "Oblivion."
Because Riseborough has played such a wide variety of roles without developing a tangible star persona, she is often described as a "chameleon" or even "unrecognizable," which is Hollywood-speak for an actress who doesn't wear eye makeup. Still, the woman is damn castable: She appeared in four movies last year alone, including "To Leslie," the tiny indie at the heart of this Oscar controversy.
What is "To Leslie"?
Directed by Michael Morris, "To Leslie" stars Riseborough as the title character, a hard-drinking West Texan who won the lottery years ago but has blown through her money and torpedoed her relationships in the time since. As her frustrated family and friends wonder what to do with the belligerent Leslie, big questions are bandied about: Is it better to let an addict hit rock bottom or to extend a helping hand? Does there ever come a time when severing family ties should be done for your own good? And hey, is that Stephen Root, the stapler nerd from "Office Space," playing a leather-daddy biker? (Alongside a glowering Allison Janney, no less!)
The film debuted at South by Southwest last March alongside a much more high-profile Oscar contender, "Everything Everywhere All at Once," and though "To Leslie" received mostly positive reviews, it earned less than $ 30,000 during its October release. In a year when many specialty films struggled to find an audience in theaters, that box office total was still so low that Riseborough's co-star, the podcaster Marc Maron, accused the "To Leslie" distributor, Momentum Pictures, of "gross incompetence" on Twitter, then blasted the studio for failing to submit the film for awards consideration by most industry guilds. That sort of negligence might make people want to take matters into their own hands ... but we'll get to that.
How is Riseborough's performance?
Though Leslie is a scrappy slip of a person, Riseborough makes a lot of big choices while playing her. It's a pugnacious, eccentric performance, and though I'm an on-the-record fan of maximalist acting, I should let you know that if this were measured on a scale of 1 (utter naturalism) to 10 (Kristen Wiig as Liza Minnelli trying to turn off a lamp), Riseborough would be pulling an awfully high number.
In other words, it's the sort of big, actressy transformation that awards voters flock to like catnip, and if someone like Charlize Theron or Michelle Williams had de-glammed to play Leslie, there likely would have been Oscar buzz from the beginning. But without box office success or a big name, Riseborough appeared to be a non-starter.
What was unusual about her Oscar campaign?
A typical Oscar race plays out like a couture-clad season of "Squid Game," where a large number of hopefuls are winnowed down to a surviving few. To stay in the conversation until the very end, it helps to win critics awards and earn nominations at televised awards shows, and Riseborough lagged on both counts: She hadn't mustered much more than an Independent Spirit Award nomination and had no deep-pocketed distributor ready to buy For Your Consideration ads on her behalf. By most pundits' estimation, she was not a serious contender, nor even an on-the-bubble dark horse.
But during the second week of January, just days before voting for the Oscar nominations began, a cadre of movie stars suddenly took to social media on Riseborough's behalf. Edward Norton was the first big booster, telling his two million Twitter followers that Riseborough gave "the most fully committed, emotionally deep ... physically harrowing performance I've seen in a while." The next day, Gwyneth Paltrow announced on Instagram that "Andrea should win every award there is and all the ones that haven't been invented yet."
As the week wore on, at least two dozen more celebrities climbed aboard the Riseborough Railroad -- from A-listers like Amy Adams, Kate Winslet and Jennifer Aniston to random stowaways like Jenny McCarthy and Tan France -- and award watchers started to wonder what the hell was going on. The answer that emerged is that a late-breaking campaign had been waged by Riseborough's manager, Jason Weinberg, and the actress Mary McCormack, who is married to Morris, the "To Leslie" director, to get the film in front of as many of their famous industry friends as possible.
"The movie cannot afford any FYC ads, so this letter and invitation will have to do instead!" McCormack wrote in one of her mass emails, which were published by Vanity Fair. In a later missive, she said movies like "To Leslie" were an endangered species in need of support, writing, "I worry that unless we all support small independent filmmaking, it'll just get eaten up by Marvel movies and go away forever."
With those entreaties, McCormack, Weinberg and Riseborough assembled a starry battalion of boosters that eventually included even her best actress competitor Cate Blanchett, who gave Riseborough a shout-out during her televised acceptance speech at the Critics Choice Awards. (This begs the question: Would Lydia Tár have been Team Riseborough? I don't think the fictional conductor could ever bring herself to endorse a movie about West Texas -- they eat too much barbecue there -- though I could imagine a scene where she receives McCormack's mass email, grimaces and then orders an underling to delete it.)
Why were people so upset?
This was hardly the first time that a contender had taken Oscar promotion into her own hands: Who can forget Melissa Leo's iconic "Consider" ad campaign, in which the eventual Oscar winner donned furs and posed among pillars like a Blackglama model prowling Hearst Castle? But Riseborough's team bypassed the FYC-ad industrial complex entirely, opting to wage a weeklong war powered mostly by word of mouth instead of an expensive, multi-month campaign that would have involved round tables, parties, red-carpet appearances, film-festival tributes and endless press hits.
It was an unprecedented awards-season gambit, and it worked: When the presenter Riz Ahmed read Riseborough's name out loud during the Jan. 24 announcement of the Oscar nominations, the journalists in attendance gasped, giggled and oohed like a scandalized sitcom audience. They knew that Riseborough had just pulled off something crazy, and it didn't take long before rival awards strategists began working the phones, suggesting that her grass-roots campaign may have run afoul of Oscar rules.
And as the Riseborough surge sunk in, her surprise nomination was weighed against the snubs of the "Woman King" star Viola Davis and the "Till" lead Danielle Deadwyler: If those two Black actresses had been nominated alongside the "Everything Everywhere All at Once" star Michelle Yeoh, as many pundits were expecting, it would have been the first time in Oscar history that the best actress race featured a majority of women of color.
In an essay for The Hollywood Reporter published Tuesday, the "Woman King" director, Gina Prince-Bythewood, did not mention Riseborough by name but alluded to the "social capital" that had helped propel her to a nomination. "Black women in this industry, we don't have that power," Prince-Bythewood wrote. "There is no groundswell from privileged people with enormous social capital to get behind Black women. There never has been."
Did the campaign break any rules?
In a statement released on Jan. 27, the academy announced it would review the campaign procedures of the year's nominees to make sure none of its guidelines were violated. Though Riseborough and "To Leslie" weren't mentioned specifically, a reference to grass-roots campaigns in the statement all but confirmed that her nomination was the subject of investigation.
Which aspects of the campaign might have earned scrutiny? Online sleuths noticed that a slew of copy-paste phrases -- including the description of "To Leslie" as "a small film with a giant heart" -- had appeared in social-media posts from the unlikely likes of Mia Farrow, Meredith Vieira and Joe Mantegna. And there was an eyebrow-raising Instagram post from the actress Frances Fisher, soon to be seen tightening Kate Winslet's corset in the "Titanic" rerelease, who encouraged voters to select Riseborough because "Viola, Michelle, Danielle & Cate are a lock," though it's generally forbidden to mention specific competitors in that way.
As the controversy began to heat up, wild rumors flew that Riseborough's nomination could be rescinded. Puck News even wondered, "Was the Andrea Riseborough Oscar Campaign Illegal?" -- a headline so breathless that you'd half-expect someone like Paltrow to be hauled before The Hague as an accomplice. (Hey, if you can't lock someone up for selling jade vagina eggs, maybe they could be arrested for the lesser charge of Oscar meddling. Isn't that how they got Al Capone?)
Have Oscar nominations ever been rescinded before?
Rarely, but the last two times it happened, the cause was improper campaigning. In 2014, the academy rescinded Bruce Broughton's extremely "huh?" original-song nomination from the obscure faith-based film "Alone Yet Not Alone" because he'd leaned on his influence as a former academy governor when soliciting consideration. And in 2017, the academy yanked the nomination for the "13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi" sound mixer Greg P. Russell because he had engaged in "telephone lobbying."
It was tempting, then, to wonder if a Riseborough rebuke might change the entire makeup of the best actress race: After all, the Emmys rescinded Peter MacNicol's 2016 nomination for guest actor in a comedy after learning he had appeared in too many "Veep" episodes to qualify, and then his replacement, the "Girls" guest star Peter Scolari, actually went on to win in the category. But even if the academy had seen fit to give Riseborough the hook, there would be no one to take her place. According to the academy's bylaws, the race would simply be reduced to the remaining four nominees.
So what happens now?
On the last day of January, the academy's chief executive, Bill Kramer, released another statement about the investigation, and though this statement did mention the "To Leslie" awards campaign by name, it concluded that Riseborough's nomination would not be rescinded. "However, we did discover social media and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern," Kramer wrote. "These tactics are being addressed with the responsible parties directly."
It's unclear who those parties are: The academy didn't name names, Riseborough hasn't given an interview since the morning of the nominations, and Fisher's Instagram post was still up last time I checked. But even if the terms of the scolding are unclear, the far-reaching effects of Riseborough's curveball campaign have the potential to change the way we think of awards season.
For one, a new spotlight has been put on the academy's vaunted diversity efforts: Is it enough to simply recruit more members of color when so many of the voters remain obstinate, older white people who, for example, told Prince-Bythewood that they'd had no interest in seeing her movie? Of the four acting categories, the best-actress race has proved most hostile to recognizing people of color, and that won't change until voters recognize the biases they hold when determining whose stories matter.
But it also means that next season, just when we think the amount of viable Oscar contenders has shrunk to almost five, a surprise could come from nowhere that completely changes the race. Riseborough pioneered a risky new tactic that other would-be contenders could use to slingshot themselves back into viability. All they'll need is patience -- well, and an improbably starry Rolodex that hopefully has little overlap with Riseborough's. After all, if Winslet has already called Riseborough "the greatest female performance onscreen I have ever seen in my life," will we believe her when she says the same thing next year about M3gan?

Microsoft's Activision Deal Tests New Global Alignment on Antitrust: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Until recently, antitrust regulators in Europe and the United States took different approaches. Now, they're on the same page -- which some experts say makes closing deals harder.
When Microsoft announced its $ 70 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard last year, almost everyone involved expected antitrust inquiries from officials in the European Union and Britain, and many thought regulators there would try to block the deal. What U.S. enforcers would do, however, was less clear.
By December, it had become apparent that all three regulators would scrutinize the deal -- and that they were playing off one another's plans.
The tell? The Federal Trade Commission chose to sue Microsoft in its own administrative court rather than first moving to block the deal in a federal court. Typically, the agency would seek a temporary injunction from a federal judge to stop a transaction from going through before trial; in this case, the European Union's antitrust authority had already announced it was reviewing the deal. And the F.T.C. knew Europe's inquiry meant the deal was at least many months away from closing, so it went straight to its own, more favorable court.
Welcome to the modern era of global antitrust enforcement -- an elaborate labyrinth of regulatory bodies working together.
Cooperation among antitrust regulators isn't new, and U.S. regulators have long discussed timing on cases, arguments, objections and potential remedies with their foreign counterparts. The shift now is that what are perhaps the three most important regulators worldwide -- the F.T.C., the European Commission, and Britain's Competition and Markets Authority -- are roughly on the same page. All of them want to be seen as tough on deals.
Microsoft's Activision deal is the biggest test yet of this new alignment between global antitrust enforcers, which some lawyers say is making it tougher for big corporations to close deals.
Microsoft's case
Officials in more than a dozen countries are reviewing Microsoft's Activision deal, which would vault Microsoft to the top of the $ 175 billion gaming industry. Some fear that if Microsoft owns Activision, it could make some of the world's most popular games, like "Call of Duty," exclusive to its Xbox consoles.
Microsoft has said that it is not interested in this strategy, and that it is acquiring Activision to gain a foothold in mobile gaming and virtual reality. In filings and statements, the company has pledged to keep licensing of Activision games open to its competitors including Sony and Nintendo.
In the past, so-called behavioral remedies, in which companies pledge to refrain from certain activities that could hurt competition, had been accepted by antitrust enforcers, such was the case in the 2010 merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster. But today, it's harder for companies to make these sorts of compromises.
Until recently, the European Commission was often seen as the toughest antitrust regulator, taking a more expansive view of what could harm competition. On the other end of the spectrum was the United States, where decades of precedent leaned toward a more limited view of the kinds of deals that should be blocked. And so deal makers believed that if they could appease the European Union with a behavioral remedy, their transaction was likely to survive global scrutiny.
That has changed. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, which was established in 2014, has positioned itself as pushing for tougher powers after Brexit, presenting itself as a check on Big Tech and other corporate giants. In the United States, President Biden has appointed antitrust officials -- Lina Khan of the F.T.C. and Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department's antitrust division -- who have expansive takes on regulating competition. Khan, in particular, has championed cracking down on mergers and Big Tech, and she has said she is willing to take on tough-to-win cases to help stretch the boundaries of antitrust law.
Cracking down on consolidation, especially in Big Tech, is politically popular on both the right and left, and antitrust cases are getting more attention from the public.
One former enforcement official, who asked not to be named because his employer had not authorized him to comment, put it this way to DealBook: Regulators would rather fight to block a deal and lose than accept a compromise, because the political cost of agreement is too steep.
Alignment across The Atlantic
The F.T.C. opposed Microsoft's bid to acquire Activision in a lawsuit filed in December. Microsoft's legal team also expects the antitrust authority in Britain to oppose the transaction, while it believes the European Commission is open to potential remedies, according to four people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Some of these people said that Microsoft was hoping to convince both Britain and the European Union to accept its concessions and approve the deal, which could make it easier for the company to reach an agreement with the F.T.C. before the scheduled administrative trial starts in the summer. If all of the agencies accept the compromise, the (perhaps wishful) thinking goes, none of them will look weak on Big Tech.
That logic also works in reverse: Any of the three agencies could instead put pressure on the others to oppose the acquisition.
Still, the closer philosophical alignment of American, British and European merger enforcers has its limits, as a major blow to the F.T.C. this week made clear. A federal judge rejected the agency's bid to block a deal by Meta, Facebook's parent company, to buy a virtual reality fitness start-up. That case was built upon a little-tested legal theory that the deal would hurt future competition in an untested market -- similar to the F.T.C.'s argument that Microsoft's purchase of Activision would be a threat to the still-nascent market for cloud-based gaming.
Ms. Khan herself has suggested that even if these types of cases fail, they can still push the boundaries of antitrust enforcement. For example, in the decision on Meta's bid to buy Within, which was unsealed on Friday evening, the judge found merit in the legal theory even while deciding the facts in the particular case were unconvincing.
"The new heads are trying to understand new harms," said Eleanor Fox, a professor at N.Y.U. law school who is an expert in competition policy. "They're moving into new territory."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An amateur D.J. meets a highflying music industry executive and lands the rights to remix one of the greatest hits of all time.
It could be an inspiring story. Or it could be the story of David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who was able to remix Whitney Houston's "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)," thanks to Larry Mestel, whose music company is a client of the bank and has financial interests in the oeuvres of music legends like Prince, Bob Marley and Ms. Houston.
Mr. Solomon has been spinning records for years, mixing electronic dance music for live audiences at tiki bars in the Bahamas, at the big Chicago music festival Lollapalooza, in downtown Manhattan. He has released about a dozen dance tracks in collaboration with a handful of producers. The Goldman chief even started his own record label, Payback Records.
But the Whitney Houston remix, which became available on Spotify and other streaming platforms last summer, about six months ahead of a biopic about the singer that shares its title with the pop hit, might be his biggest win yet.
Mr. Solomon has long maintained that his D.J.ing passion has nothing to do with Goldman. And many bank insiders also say that the D.J. gig is little more than a minor headache for Goldman, even if its highly visible and unusual nature -- Instagram posts, Spotify playlists and a live performance that broke Covid protocols -- risks drawing unwelcome attention at a time when the bank is struggling with its performance.
Goldman recently laid off 3,200 workers and announced a $ 3 billion loss tied to a misbegotten foray into consumer banking. The bank's board also cut Mr. Solomon's pay.
But Mr. Solomon's hobby occasionally brushes up against his day job in ways that could pose potential conflicts of interest, according to interviews with securities law experts and four people who have worked with Mr. Solomon who were not authorized to speak publicly. Company executives and public officials typically try to minimize even minor conflicts because even the slightest hint of one can bring unwanted scrutiny and bad publicity.
Mr. Solomon has told senior Goldman executives that he donates any profits he makes as a D.J. to charity. But Goldman employees have sometimes helped him manage his D.J. schedule and his donations, three people who have worked with him said.
Through Goldman's work in the music business, he has also made at least one industry connection that helped him pursue his hobby, raising questions about whether his opportunities have come about because of his talent or his position as the leader of Wall Street's most elite investment bank.
"The question is: What is best for Goldman Sachs?," said Jonathan Macey, a professor of corporate and securities law at Yale Law School. "Does Goldman Sachs deserve this guy's undivided attention?"
In an emailed statement, a spokesman for Goldman, Tony Fratto, said that D.J.ing is a hobby for Mr. Solomon and has nothing to do with the bank's business.
"The reporting is trying to assert that there is overlap or intermingling of David's music activities and his role as C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs," Mr. Fratto said. "It's clear that both David and Goldman Sachs have been scrupulous in keeping the relationship separate."
The apparent ease with which Mr. Solomon landed the Whitney Houston remix deal caught the attention of many in the music business, where even successful musicians have to hustle when seeking blessings from the various entities controlling the copyrights to worldwide hits.
For amateur D.J.s without Mr. Solomon's direct line to Mr. Mestel, getting approval for the remix of Ms. Houston's hit would have been much harder, said Guillermo Page, the assistant director of the music business and entertainment industries program at the University of Miami Frost School of Music.
"When you're dealing with someone of the stature of Whitney Houston, it's very likely that they have some restrictions as to who can use the sound recording," Mr. Page said. "Just because you want to do your own remix or you want to make your own creation doesn't automatically mean you're going to be approved."
Once Mr. Solomon and Mr. Mestel settled on Whitney Houston, Mr. Mestel convinced Pat Houston, the sister-in-law of the deceased singer who is the executor of her estate, to sign off on the project, Pat Houston said in an interview. Sony Music Entertainment, which owns the original recording of Ms. Houston's song, also approved it.
"Our business is in part to get artists to cover, sample, and or remix our legendary song catalog," Mr. Mestel said in an emailed statement. He declined to disclose the terms of the deal. Mr. Fratto said that Mr. Solomon's lawyer dealt with Sony on its particulars. Sony declined to comment.
Mr. Solomon's remix may have helped fortify his presence as a D.J. recently, with his monthly listeners on Spotify numbering around 600,000, said Serona Elton, a professor at the University of Miami and the director of music industry program at the Frost School of Music.
"It's a very high number for a relatively unknown artist," Ms. Elton said.
At the same time, Mr. Solomon's overall rank as an artist -- measured by the number of people choosing to stream his music, as opposed to hearing it on a premade playlist -- remained low, she said. On Chartmetric, which ranks all published artists based on their streaming statistics and social media mentions, Mr. Solomon ranked at 37,547.
Ms. Elton said that was pretty far down the list, "above the masses who only have their mom checking them out, but certainly not a name that most people on the street would know." But she added that "a really crazy hot track," like the Whitney Houston remix, "can cut through clutter and get attention."
In a November email, Mr. Mestel said he suggested the song to Mr. Solomon in 2021, and that the remix had been streamed more than 2 million times on Spotify.
"Seems like he did a pretty good job," he said.
As of early February, the remix, released by Arista, had been streamed 3 million times. (By comparison, the original hit has more than 915 million streams on Spotify.)
Another track he collaborated on with Grammy-winning producer Ryan Tedder has gotten more than 8 million streams on Spotify.
Mr. Mestel said he met Mr. Solomon "many years ago when he was running investment banking for Goldman and he came to my office to speak about business."
Mr. Solomon became the bank's chief executive in 2018, the same year Mr. Mestel's Primary Wave became a Goldman client -- although another Goldman banker already had a relationship with the company. The following year, Mr. Mestel was named one of the year's "100 Most Intriguing Entrepreneurs," an annual list published by Goldman. The list was a pet project of Mr. Solomon's, according to a person with knowledge of the process.
"There's a kind of prima facie appearance of: 'you scratch my back, I scratch yours,"' said Yaron Nili, an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School who specializes in corporate and securities law.
Mr. Fratto said Mr. Solomon did not personally pick Mr. Mestel for the list, and that there is "no economic component" to their relationship.
Mr. Solomon's dealings with music industry executives come as many big companies have begun buying catalogs of well-established artists and building new moneymaking ventures.
Last year, Sony purchased the entire catalog of Bob Dylan's recorded music. More recently, a firm backed by private equity giant Blackstone paid a reported $ 200 million for the rights to the catalog of pop artist Justin Bieber.
For investment banks like Goldman, which make money by advising companies and arranging loans, these deals can be a meaningful source of revenue. In 2022, the music giant Broadcast Music, Inc., or BMI, hired Goldman to advise it on a possible sale, according to Bloomberg News, which also reported that Goldman advised the music company Concord on a potential deal.
Since 2016, Goldman has published a closely watched annual report called "Music in the Air," which describes current trends in music investing and publishing and offers projections for the industry's performance in the future.
"Goldman is extremely interested in music," said David Lieberman, an associate professor of professional practice in media management at The New School. "They see it as an opportunity, and for what seemed to be good reasons. These catalogs seem to have real steady value."
Mr. Fratto said that Goldman has a "large existing music industry business that goes back decades," and that there was no connection between Mr. Solomon's hobby and the bank's business interests.
In 2018, Mr. Solomon established Payback Records, which a spokesman for the label described as a "small, nascent, but aspirational side project" for the bank chief. It's unclear how many employees Payback has, but a young, up-and-coming music industry executive named Adam Alpert, who is nominated for a Grammy this year, is known in the business as Mr. Solomon's informal manager, two people familiar with the description said. Mr. Solomon has also identified Mr. Alpert as his manager to Goldman employees, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Mr. Fratto said the two men are friends. Mr. Alpert, who runs Disruptor Records in a joint venture with Sony, has offered Mr. Solomon an idea or opportunity "on rare occasions," Mr. Fratto said, but "David doesn't have a manager because he doesn't need one: There's nothing to manage."
During the summer of 2020, at the height of the Covid pandemic, Mr. Solomon played at a show in the Hamptons headlined by The Chainsmokers -- a band that Mr. Alpert manages. (New York Health authorities investigated the event for "rampant violations" of Covid protocols. Mr. Solomon later acknowledged to Goldman insiders he'd made a mistake, The New York Times has previously reported.)
Business executives often rely on office assistants to maintain their personal and professional calendars, but Mr. Solomon has sometimes gone further.
Brandon Launerts, a former Goldman employee who worked in the bank's marketing department as a social media manager, held occasional calls with people working for Payback -- including a marketing firm it uses to help manage Mr. Solomon's social media presence. The aim was to go over strategies for promoting new music releases and appearances by Mr. Solomon, and ensure that his D.J.ing activities did not interfere with his Goldman commitments, according to two people with knowledge of the calls.
Mr. Fratto called the communications "normal" because they involved coordinating on scheduling matters, and to consider "any potential risks" for Goldman. He added that the calls are infrequent given Mr. Solomon's limited D.J. engagements.
Last fall, Todd Wilkinson, a D.J. who goes by the name "Liquid Todd," took a selfie with three other men, including Mr. Launerts, whom he described in an Instagram post as "The @paybackrecords crew." Mr. Launerts replied to the post with an emoji showing two hands pressed together, which is often interpreted as "thank you." Another person in the photo, Luc Espinosa, had interned at Goldman over the summer.
Mr. Espinosa could not be reached for comment. Mr. Wilkinson did not respond to requests for comment about the photo. But three weeks after he posted the photo, it was deleted it from his account following queries from Times reporters about Mr. Solomon's D.J. career.

At the Extremes, He Found the Joy: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Charles Munch started work as the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the fall of 1949, he gave a speech.
There wasn't much he could say, in truth. His English was poor, though he had just sacrificed an umlaut in his surname in deference to American spelling. An Alsatian sometimes known in Germany as Karl, and in France always as Charles, he had served the Kaiser on the Somme in the First World War, then defended French culture in resistance to the Nazis in the Second. If he bothered to hold a rehearsal at all, he spoke to his musicians in a variety of languages, or let his gestures, flamboyant yet intentional, do the talking.
Munch wanted to make one thing clear to the Bostonians, though: He was not their former music director, Serge Koussevitzky. The orchestra's players had toiled under him, an autocrat whose shadow lingered over Munch, too. Even after Munch died in 1968 -- while touring the United States with the Orchestre de Paris, which he had formed a year before -- his New York Times obituary labored over the comparison with his predecessor, describing his task as having been "on a par with trying to follow Thomas Alva Edison as an inventor or Magellan as a navigator."
Yet Munch had no interest in being Koussevitzky's kind of maestro; once a Stradivarius-wielding concertmaster himself, he saw no artistic or human point in making a musician miserable. As Time reported in a cover story in December 1949, he spent his first weeks in Boston telling his players that they could rest easier. In his introductory remarks, he told them that "there will be joy." For him, "beauty, joy and goodness" were the calling of an artist. As such, music, as he said in 1954, could offer "reconciliation with life itself." Munch was shy and private when his baton was not slicing through sound; his biographer, D. Kern Holoman, has argued that conducting gave him relief from sadness of all sorts, whether the grief of enduring two wars between the cultures that claimed him, or the anguish of an unhappy marriage. (Holoman taught at the University of California, Davis, until 2017, when he left over rape allegations.)
Conducting may have given Munch relief, but perhaps not deliverance. His interpretations could be as extreme as his times, at one moment outlandishly swift or brutally violent, contemplative or uncommonly tender the next, giddy fun at the last. The critic Virgil Thomson wrote of his approach to Franck's Symphony that "he plays it very slow and very fast, very soft and very loud, reins it in and whips it up, gives it (and us) a huge workout." That description fits more broadly; Munch was the rare conductor who welcomed imprecisions, even coarseness of tone, in his pursuit of outright spontaneity. An objectivist he was not.
All this and more is clear from Munch's enthralling discography. His Boston recordings for the RCA label were collated in an 86-disc Sony set in 2016; it has sold out, but most of the contents are still on streaming platforms. Warner and Eloquence have since separately boxed their catalogs of his pre- and post-Boston releases, giving a sense of Munch from his first sessions, with the pianist Alfred Cortot in Saint-Saëns in 1935, to his last, with the Orchestre de Paris in Ravel in 1968. Munch was a different musician under studio conditions than he was live, Holoman writes, and he controlled his most explosive tendencies in the hope of making records that would last. Even his two incendiary Boston readings of Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique," his trademark piece, come nowhere close to the maelstrom he inflamed onstage. He dared one of the world's most proficient orchestras to play beyond itself in concert; some of his finest releases -- his Schubert Ninth, his Mendelssohn Third -- are, conversely, those in which he builds tension by refusing to let go as blatantly as he might in front of an audience.
Even so, sample Munch's recordings -- more than the Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel in which he was justly celebrated -- and it is hard to disagree with the verdict of the Times critic Howard Taubman, who wrote of a 1950 concert: "Whether the music is illuminated or driven, it is never just respectable or indifferent. It is alive; it is the natural outgrowth of the conductor's point of view."

MUNCH WAS BORN in Strasbourg, which was then in Germany, on Sept. 26, 1891, into a dynasty of musicians. His father, Ernest, mounted a Bach revival leading the church choir of Saint-Guillaume; his brother, Fritz, was a conductor and conservatory director; his uncle Eugène was an organist who taught Albert Schweitzer, whose friendship and spirituality influenced Charles throughout his life.
Charles learned all kinds of instruments, like a little Bach might, but settled on the violin and was playing under his father's baton by his early teens. He went to Paris in 1912 to study with Lucien Capet, a famed quartet violinist, but returned home to his family days before Germany invaded Belgium. Conscripted into the German army with two brothers, he was injured as an artilleryman at Verdun; he subsequently embraced pacifism and took succor in music.
The common critique of Munch as a mature conductor was that his volatility ill fit works in the Haydn-to-Brahms tradition, but he had a strong training in the Romantic school of German conducting. After playing as the concertmaster of the Strasbourg orchestra from 1919 to 1924, he spent a year under Hermann Abendroth in Cologne, then held the same post at the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig for six seasons, working for Wilhelm Furtwängler and Bruno Walter. His return to Paris in 1932 to start his podium career -- with Brahms's First -- was made possible by the wealth of the Nestlé heiress Geneviève Maury, his new wife.
At first, Munch was renowned for supporting new music, and during World War II, he made his allegiances clear by protecting and promoting French composers. At the helm of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, France's leading ensemble, Munch told his players in September 1940 that it was through art that they could "continue the fight." One of his most intimate friends, the pianist Nicole Henriot, would have her hand crushed by the Gestapo; Munch joined the Resistance, helped those he could, and tried to avoid compromising situations.
Research on the culture of wartime France by Jane F. Fulcher, Leslie A. Sprout and other scholars has suggested that while the Nazis visited horrors on Jewish artists, neither the occupiers nor their Vichy collaborators -- nor their Resistance opponents -- sought to curtail concert life. Most musicians in the Resistance carried on as if the occupation did not exist; French music, except that by Jews, was not banned. Careful still to tend to proud Parisian traditions in the Germanic classics, Munch spent much of the war showcasing contemporary scores, such as politically ambiguous new works like Honegger's Second Symphony and pieces that had been written in Nazi camps, including Jean Martinon's "Stalag IX."
Munch and the Société became so busy, they reached a strikingly high standard. Their wartime recordings, now in the Warner box, are remarkable for their calm, even in "La Mer" or "La Valse." After their liberation, they let loose for Decca; the Eloquence set superbly reproduces the orchestra's distinctive postwar timbre, as well as Munch's intensity of expression. There is crisp Beethoven, heartbreaking Tchaikovsky, delicate yet eager Ravel. An account of Berlioz's "Le Corsaire," from May 1948, is so exhilarating, it is little surprise that the authorities were reluctant to let Munch leave. BUT LEAVE MUNCH DID. On an initial visit to the United States that started near the end of 1946, he enjoyed the New York Philharmonic yet found the Boston Symphony to be "the culmination of all orchestras," as he told The Boston Globe. He led that ensemble in only seven concerts before he signed a contract to become its permanent conductor, in March 1948. Despite a brutal schedule that included the first tour by an American orchestra in the Soviet Union, in 1956, he stayed through 1962.
While George Szell was giving the Cleveland Orchestra a focused power, and Eugene Ormandy sought glitter and gold in Philadelphia, Munch brightened Boston's formerly dark hues, bringing its strident brass and cutting winds to the fore -- most prominently the quivering principal flute of Doriot Anthony Dwyer, who became the only woman in the orchestra after Munch hired her in 1952.
Critics heard the transparent, though dry, results as typically French, but the ensemble's fervor -- its blare, some said -- under Munch was his own, removed from the grace that his mentor, Pierre Monteux, drew from the same players. If Thomson had warned the Symphony in 1944 that "its form is perfect, but it does not communicate," after a decade of Munch, the reverse might have been more true.
The cliché about Munch's Boston Symphony was that it was all but a Parisian ensemble in exile. "When I was living in New York in the '50s," Michael Steinberg of The Globe wrote in 1964, "I used to imagine Symphony Hall as the scene of a more or less perpetual performance of the Berlioz 'Symphonie Fantastique,' relieved now and again by 'Daphnis and Chloe' and 'La Mer."' That slur notwithstanding, Munch's advocacy was unwavering and proud: His Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel were references for a generation.

Although the beauties of Munch's Boston-era recordings of French music are great, some of them stray intriguingly from the norm. He rarely treated Debussy or Ravel as scores only to paint with prettily: For all their gorgeous interplay of voices, there is often a bite to them, as if Munch were deliberately placing them in a lineage that ran back to Berlioz and forward to Roussel and Honegger, and later Dutilleux. Once or twice, his own loneliness breaks through; he draws out "Le Jardin Féerique," at the end of "Ma Mère l'Oye," until it is tear-inducingly poignant.
Still, Munch's tastes were broad, and he could be as fascinating beyond the French repertory. As a matter of principle and proclivity, he kept up Koussevitzky's loyalty to new music, ardently recording Piston, Martinu and other works that he premiered. He largely avoided Germany after the war, but the most performed composers in his first decade in Boston were Beethoven, Mozart, Bach and Brahms. Little of his hard-driven Mozart and already-outdated Bach survive, but his Brahms was strong, and his Beethoven full of ideas. Some of those ideas work, and some do not, but that's the reminder that Munch offers today: Virtuosity is empty without the thrill of interpretive risk. "He was without peer in the things he did best and, even in the things he did worst, never less than interesting," the critic Martin Bernheimer wrote after his death. "There are few like him left."

Raye, Tired of Music’s Waiting Game, Releases an Album at Last

When British artist Raye performed “Ice Cream Man.” during a January concert at cavernous Utilita Arena in Birmingham, England, many of the young women in the audience began to cry.
“Everything you did, it left me in a ruin/And no I didn’t say a word/I guess that proves it/I’m a woman,” she sang, her voice assertive, but with a quiver of vulnerability. The intimate, spare track recounts her experience of sexual assault, and was one of several unflinchingly personal songs in her set as the opening act on Lewis Capaldi’s tour.
As she belted out “Escapism.,” a collaboration with 070 Shake that earned Raye her first U.K. No. 1 last month, the crowd screamed the lyrics back to her. Even that track, which exploded on TikTok and recounts a nihilistic night out with glib humor, is “actually quite a sad song,” Raye said, sitting in the bedroom she’d created on her tour bus after the show, a burning Le Labo candle nearby. But she chose to put the melody over “this fat beat with this fat bass,” adding sirens, synths and strings, which “makes me feel powerful in my pain,” she said.
Transforming her pain into power is a recurring theme on Raye’s debut album, “My 21st Century Blues,” which arrives Friday, nine years after the 25-year-old musician signed her first record deal.
“When you think, ‘I want to be an artist,’ there are a few things you think of, the first thing being: album,” she said. But waiting became as much a part of her journey as creating.
Raye joined the roster of Polydor Records in 2014, and in the subsequent years wrote on tracks for artists including Beyoncé, John Legend and Charli XCX. While she worked on her own music, she said that the label encouraged her to make chart-friendly dance tracks with DJs like Joel Corry and David Guetta, which she now believes pigeonholed her as “the girl who sings on dance songs” that she didn’t even like. She wanted to create a body of work, but, “from a business perspective, they decided for me that I was this, and this was all I would ever be,” she said.
Sitting in her tour bus in stage makeup and sweatpants, Raye recalled the moment in June 2021 when, as she was about to record a performance for NYC Pride, a member of her team told her that she wasn’t going to be able to release an album with Polydor after all. “I freakin’ lost it,” she said. After bursting into tears, she wiped her eyes, recorded the broadcast and later posted a string of tweets about her frustration with the industry that drew loud support from other artists. Three weeks later, she announced that she had parted ways with the label.
A Polydor spokesperson declined to comment on Raye’s description of her time with the company, and said, “We’ve loved seeing Raye having all of this well-deserved success and wish her the very best.”
Raye was determined to carry on. Last year, she signed a deal with the distribution service Human Re Sources. Its founder andCEO, J. Erving, who is also an executive vice president at Sony, said in a video interview that Raye could have gotten more money upfront — “the bag, so to speak” — if she had signed with a traditional label. But instead she “bet on herself,” choosing to release her album as an independent artist who owns her masters.
For Raye, creative control was the key to continuing in an industry that had nearly broken her down. “I’m not interested in being a ‘singles’ girl, it’s the last thing I ever wanted to be,” she said. For her, the album format is not about “selling records” but telling stories.
Raye (born Rachel Keen) has known what kind of artist she wanted to be from a young age. At 10, she was determined to attend the BRIT School, the performing arts institution known for famous alumni, including Amy Winehouse and Adele. Four years later, she won a place at the school, which is near the home in south London she shared with her parents and three younger sisters.
Raye said she was so devoted to her budding career, she gave up her social life to write music after school and on weekends with professionals she met through her guitar teacher: “I’d get the train up to whatever address in my calendar and I would go into a room full of middle-aged men and be like ‘Hey, I’m going to write a song.’”
Growing up, her Ghanaian-Swiss mother and English father “worked stupidly, exceptionally hard,” she said, as a nurse and in insurance. Church, where her father played piano and her mother sang in the choir, was a big part of family life.
But Raye’s private time with the records she loved inspired her to dream big. Every day after school, she would lie on the living room floor and play “The Diary of Alicia Keys,” the singer’s 2003 album, “like a religion,” she said. With its hip-hop overture, spoken-word interludes and vivid storytelling, Raye said “Diary” made her excited to one day write her own liner notes, order her own track listing and tell people who she was through her music.
Raye’s vision for her debut album began with its title. “I wanted to tell my blues,” she said, which she defined as both a “12-bar phrase” but also “the stories on top.” Heartbreak, so often a focus in pop music, was just one small part of the human experience, she added, and the album also explores disordered eating and addiction.
“As a woman, it’s so taboo, and so unattractive, and so like, ‘God, she’s such a mess’ to even discuss having a problem,” Raye said. She described “Body Dysmorphia.” as the album’s most revealing track. “I’m so hungry I can’t sleep/But I know if I eat/Then I’ll be in the bathroom on my knees” she sings, her voice staccato over a trip-hop beat.
Making music out of hard truths has become as central to her mission as speaking them when she felt the industry was holding her back. And rather than using metaphors to keep such experiences hidden, Raye said it now feels “important to be honest about those things I kept in the darkness for so many years.”
It may be therapy for her listeners, but it helps her, too: “I want to create stuff that will make me feel better.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Good Cry Can Be Good Cinema: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Bringing a great crying scene to the big screen requires a combination of craft and empathy. This is how three recent movies -- "Close," "Babylon" and "The Woman King" -- pulled it off.
Before the sniffles, before the sharp inhales and heavy swallows -- before, in other words, any of the typical sounds of crying -- you hear the muted pitter-patter of a child's tears making landfall on his T-shirt.
The scene comes about three quarters of the way through "Close," an Oscar-nominated drama (in theaters) from the 31-year-old Belgian filmmaker Lukas Dhont about a passionate friendship between two adolescent boys, Léo (Eden Dambrine) and Rémi (Gustav De Waele), that collapses under its own emotional weight. The child crying is Léo. The location is a doctor's office, where Léo is having a cast put on his wrist after a hockey accident. But we understand that his crying reflects something more profound than physical pain. The doctor wraps; Léo's tears drop. Pip. Pip. Pip.
If Dhont and his team have done their jobs well, this sound will help pull you into the crushing emotions of the moment. You might feel like you're there with Léo. Perhaps, fleetingly, you might feel as though you're in Léo's head. You certainly won't notice that what you're hearing each time a tear hits Léo's shirt isn't actually the sound of a teardrop at all, but the sound of a Foley artist, Julien Naudin, gingerly tapping fabric in front of a microphone at a sound studio in Amsterdam.
There's a special kind of alchemy required to capture tears on film. It takes a combination of empathy and technical craft. In a series of interviews, artists behind striking crying scenes in three recent movies -- "Close," "Babylon" and "The Woman King" -- discussed the behind-the-scenes work required to create an impactful moment of grief.
Create a Safe Space
The job begins long before filming. For "Close," Dhont spent months getting to know his cast, building an atmosphere where the performers would feel comfortable exploring their characters' vulnerabilities.
"We will go walking by the seaside," Dhont said. "We will make pancakes, we will watch each other's favorite movies. And then, sometimes, very informally, I will say, 'Why do you think Rémi cries at the breakfast?"'
On the day of shooting, a big part of the job for artists behind the camera is simply to give actors the physical and emotional space to be vulnerable. That can be easier said than done -- particularly for a blowout production like "Babylon," set in 1920s and '30s Hollywood. One key scene finds Margot Robbie's character, an actress with silver-screen ambitions, getting a big break on a silent-film set, where she reveals that she can cry on command. The sequence is a doozy, with long takes and gymnastic camera movements. For Heba Thorisdottir, the head of the makeup department, pulling it off in a way that was minimally invasive for Robbie required careful planning and on-the-fly precision.
"It's very sensitive when you are working with an actor who has to cry, because you don't know emotionally where they're going to go," she said. "And you don't want to be in there a lot."
Thorisdottir used waterproof cosmetics, plus a layer of setting spray to help it all stay intact. She also applied illuminator under Robbie's foundation, which reflects light and helps tears glow.
On set, Thorisdottir stood off-camera with a Q-Tip and glue in her hand, ready to race in and fix Robbie's makeup and eyelashes when each take finished -- like a cut man treating a boxer's face between rounds.
Catch the Light
One of the most powerful scenes in "The Woman King," a drama based on historical West African women warriors, comes when Thuso Mbedu's character, a young fighter named Nawi, cradles her gravely wounded mentor, Izogie (Lashana Lynch), in her arms. It's in the middle of a fast-moving escape scene. Izogie drops. Nawi stoops to her. Time seems to stop. "No, no, no." As Nawi's tears fall, they catch the light in midair.
It's a wrenching, beautiful image, and the product of natural sunlight corralled by Polly Morgan, the director of photography.
"When you're shooting water, whether it's rain or tears, you're always going to see it clearly when you backlight it," Morgan said. "We blocked the action in relation to the sun -- I could backlight those falling tears."
Another trick: thinking of teardrops as though they're globules of Dr Pepper.
Linus Sandgren, the director of photography for "Babylon," likens filming tears to capturing beads of liquid running down the side of a bottle in a beverage commercial.
A go-to technique, Sandgren said, is to have "a long surface of light on one side" illuminating the tear, creating a border of light that accentuates its shape. On the other side, "have a long shadow, vertically long as the tear runs down." The aim is to produce contrast that makes the teardrop stand out, and to cover the tear's journey down the actor's face with diffuse light. Do it right, and you can make the trail of liquid on skin as shiny and clear as a slime path left by a slug on a sidewalk.
Get in Close
All three of these scenes share one major cinematography choice: the use of relatively wide lenses. To make an actor fill the frame, the camera must be placed much closer to the action, which can help create intimacy and produce an emotional wallop.
With a wider lens, "there is no trick," Frank van den Eeden, the cinematographer behind "Close," said. "You're really there."
Sound design can do some of this work, too. Zeroing in on the sound of tears in "Close," for example, was intended to guide the audience to focus completely on Léo and his emotions.
"The whole world around them is of no importance in that moment," said Vincent Sinceretti, the movie's sound designer.
Know When to Stop
Equally important to creating the right environment for an actor to give an emotionally raw performance is knowing when you've gotten what you need.
"You never want to have to push an actor to have to do something like that unnecessarily," the "Woman King" director Gina Prince-Bythewood said. "If you don't have that thing inside that tells you that you got it, then you're going to go five, six, seven, eight times -- and I think that's cruel."
In the editing room, it's also crucial to identify the emotional peak -- and to make the cut at that frame, no later.
"You want to get to that point where they're just kind of inhaling and not exhaling," said Terilyn A. Shropshire, the editor of "The Woman King."
For the scene in which Nawi weeps over Izogie, Shropshire decided to cut away before Nawi had finished expressing her anguish. Because the moment comes in the middle of an action sequence, she explained, there wouldn't have been time for Nawi to grieve properly.
"Reality would have interrupted," Shropshire said.

For Conductor Charles Munch, Virtuosity Meant Taking Risks

When Charles Munch started work as the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the fall of 1949, he gave a speech.
There wasn’t much he could say, in truth. His English was poor, though he had just sacrificed an umlaut in his surname in deference to American spelling. An Alsatian sometimes known in Germany as Karl, and in France always as Charles, he had served the Kaiser on the Somme in the First World War, then defended French culture in resistance to the Nazis in the Second. If he bothered to hold a rehearsal at all, he spoke to his musicians in a variety of languages, or let his gestures, flamboyant yet intentional, do the talking.
Munch wanted to make one thing clear to the Bostonians, though: He was not their former music director, Serge Koussevitzky. The orchestra’s players had toiled under the autocrat, whose shadow lingered over Munch, too. Even after Munch died in 1968 — while touring the United States with the Orchestre de Paris, which he had formed a year before — his New York Times obituary labored over the comparison with his predecessor, describing his task as having been “on a par with trying to follow Thomas Alva Edison as an inventor or Magellan as a navigator.”
Yet Munch had no interest in being Koussevitzky’s kind of maestro; once a Stradivarius-wielding concertmaster himself, he saw no artistic or human point in making a musician miserable. As Time reported in a cover story in December 1949, he spent his first weeks in Boston telling his players that they could rest easier. In his introductory remarks, he told them that “there will be joy.”
For him, “beauty, joy and goodness” were the calling of an artist. As such, music, as he said in 1954, could offer “reconciliation with life itself.”
Munch was shy and private when his baton was not slicing through sound; his biographer, D. Kern Holoman, has argued that conducting gave him relief from sadness of all sorts, whether the grief of enduring two wars between the cultures that claimed him, or the anguish of an unhappy marriage. (Holoman taught at the University of California, Davis, until 2017, when he left over rape allegations.)
Conducting may have given Munch relief but perhaps not deliverance. His interpretations could be as extreme as his times, at one moment outlandishly swift or brutally violent, contemplative or uncommonly tender the next, giddy fun at the last. Critic Virgil Thomson wrote of his approach to Franck’s Symphony that “he plays it very slow and very fast, very soft and very loud, reins it in and whips it up, gives it (and us) a huge workout.”
That description fits more broadly; Munch was the rare conductor who welcomed imprecisions, even coarseness of tone, in his pursuit of outright spontaneity. An objectivist he was not.
All this and more is clear from Munch’s enthralling discography. His Boston recordings for the RCA label were collated in an 86-disc Sony set in 2016; it has sold out, but most of the contents are still on streaming platforms. Warner and Eloquence have since separately boxed their catalogs of his pre- and post-Boston releases, giving a sense of Munch from his first sessions, with pianist Alfred Cortot in Saint-Saëns in 1935, to his last, with the Orchestre de Paris in Ravel in 1968.
Munch was a different musician under studio conditions than he was live, Holoman writes, and he controlled his most explosive tendencies in the hope of making records that would last. Even his two incendiary Boston readings of Berlioz’s “Symphonie Fantastique,” his trademark piece, come nowhere close to the maelstrom he inflamed onstage.
He dared one of the world’s most proficient orchestras to play beyond itself in concert; some of his finest releases — his Schubert Ninth, his Mendelssohn Third — are, conversely, those in which he builds tension by refusing to let go as blatantly as he might in front of an audience.
Even so, sample Munch’s recordings — more than the Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel in which he was justly celebrated — and it is hard to disagree with the verdict of Times critic Howard Taubman, who wrote of a 1950 concert: “Whether the music is illuminated or driven, it is never just respectable or indifferent. It is alive; it is the natural outgrowth of the conductor’s point of view.”
Munch was born in Strasbourg, which was then in Germany, on Sept. 26, 1891, into a dynasty of musicians. His father, Ernest, mounted a Bach revival leading the church choir of Saint-Guillaume; his brother, Fritz, was a conductor and conservatory director; his uncle Eugène was an organist who taught Albert Schweitzer, whose friendship and spirituality influenced Charles throughout his life.
Charles Munch learned all kinds of instruments, like a little Bach might, but settled on the violin and was playing under his father’s baton by his early teens. He went to Paris in 1912 to study with Lucien Capet, a famed quartet violinist, but returned home to his family days before Germany invaded Belgium. Conscripted into the German army with two brothers, he was injured as an artilleryman at Verdun; he subsequently embraced pacifism and took succor in music.
The common critique of Munch as a mature conductor was that his volatility ill fit works in the Haydn-to-Brahms tradition, but he had a strong training in the Romantic school of German conducting.
After playing as the concertmaster of the Strasbourg orchestra from 1919 to 1924, he spent a year under Hermann Abendroth in Cologne, then held the same post at the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig for six seasons, working for Wilhelm Furtwängler and Bruno Walter.
His return to Paris in 1932 to start his podium career — with Brahms’ First — was made possible by the wealth of Nestlé heiress Geneviève Maury, his new wife.
At first, Munch was renowned for supporting new music, and during World War II, he made his allegiances clear by protecting and promoting French composers. At the helm of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, France’s leading ensemble, Munch told his players in September 1940 that it was through art that they could “continue the fight.” One of his most intimate friends, pianist Nicole Henriot, would have her hand crushed by the Gestapo; Munch joined the Resistance, helped those he could, and tried to avoid compromising situations.
Research on the culture of wartime France by Jane F. Fulcher, Leslie A. Sprout and other scholars has suggested that while the Nazis visited horrors on Jewish artists, neither the occupiers nor their Vichy collaborators — nor their Resistance opponents — sought to curtail concert life. Most musicians in the Resistance carried on as if the occupation did not exist; French music, except that by Jews, was not banned.
Careful still to tend to proud Parisian traditions in the Germanic classics, Munch spent much of the war showcasing contemporary scores, such as politically ambiguous new works like Honegger’s Second Symphony and pieces that had been written in Nazi camps, including Jean Martinon’s “Stalag IX.”
Munch and the Société became so busy, they reached a strikingly high standard. Their wartime recordings, now in the Warner box, are remarkable for their calm, even in “La Mer” or “La Valse.” After their liberation, they let loose for Decca; the Eloquence set superbly reproduces the orchestra’s distinctive postwar timbre, as well as Munch’s intensity of expression. There is crisp Beethoven, heartbreaking Tchaikovsky, delicate yet eager Ravel. An account of Berlioz’s “Le Corsaire,” from May 1948, is so exhilarating, it is little surprise that authorities were reluctant to let Munch leave.
But he did.
On an initial visit to the United States that started near the end of 1946, Munch enjoyed the New York Philharmonic yet found the Boston Symphony to be “the culmination of all orchestras,” as he told The Boston Globe. He led that ensemble in only seven concerts before he signed a contract to become its permanent conductor, in March 1948. Despite a brutal schedule that included the first tour by an American orchestra in the Soviet Union, in 1956, he stayed through 1962.
While George Szell was giving the Cleveland Orchestra a focused power, and Eugene Ormandy sought glitter and gold in Philadelphia, Munch brightened Boston’s formerly dark hues, bringing its strident brass and cutting winds to the fore — most prominently the quivering principal flute of Doriot Anthony Dwyer, who became the only woman in the orchestra after Munch hired her in 1952.
Critics heard the transparent, though dry, results as typically French, but the ensemble’s fervor — its blare, some said — under Munch was his own, removed from the grace that his mentor, Pierre Monteux, drew from the same players. If Thomson had warned the Symphony in 1944 that “its form is perfect, but it does not communicate,” after a decade of Munch, the reverse might have been more true.
The cliché about Munch’s Boston Symphony was that it was all but a Parisian ensemble in exile.
“When I was living in New York in the ’50s,” Michael Steinberg of The Globe wrote in 1964, “I used to imagine Symphony Hall as the scene of a more or less perpetual performance of the Berlioz ‘Symphonie Fantastique,’ relieved now and again by ‘Daphnis and Chloe’ and ‘La Mer.’” That slur notwithstanding, Munch’s advocacy was unwavering and proud: His Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel were references for a generation.
Although the beauties of Munch’s Boston-era recordings of French music are great, some of them stray intriguingly from the norm. He rarely treated Debussy or Ravel as scores only to paint with prettily: For all their gorgeous interplay of voices, there is often a bite to them, as if Munch were deliberately placing them in a lineage that ran back to Berlioz and forward to Roussel and Honegger, and later Dutilleux. Once or twice, his own loneliness breaks through; he draws out “Le Jardin Féerique,” at the end of “Ma Mère l’Oye,” until it is tear-inducingly poignant.
Still, Munch’s tastes were broad, and he could be as fascinating beyond the French repertory. As a matter of principle and proclivity, he kept up Koussevitzky’s loyalty to new music, ardently recording Piston, Martinu and other works that he premiered. He largely avoided Germany after the war, but the most performed composers in his first decade in Boston were Beethoven, Mozart, Bach and Brahms. Little of his hard-driven Mozart and already-outdated Bach survive, but his Brahms was strong, and his Beethoven full of ideas.
Some of those ideas work, and some do not, but that’s the reminder that Munch offers today: Virtuosity is empty without the thrill of interpretive risk.
“He was without peer in the things he did best and, even in the things he did worst, never less than interesting,” critic Martin Bernheimer wrote after his death. “There are few like him left.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Jonathan Majors in "Magazine Dreams" and Teyana Taylor in "A Thousand and One," among others, could make the journey from Park City to the Dolby Theater.
Over the past few decades, the Sundance Film Festival has premiered Oscar winners like "Manchester by the Sea," "Call Me by Your Name" and "Minari," but it wasn't until last March -- when the crowd-pleasing "CODA" won best picture -- that a Sundance movie went the distance and claimed the top Academy Award.
It may be a little while before Sundance pulls off that feat again, as the Oscar nominations announced last week featured no movies from the festival in the best-picture race; indeed, the only 2022 Sundance film to make a dent in the top six Oscar categories was the British drama "Living," which earned a best-actor nod for Bill Nighy. But could the movies that just premiered at the 2023 edition of the festival, which concluded on Sunday, help recover some of Sundance's award-season mojo?
The program certainly offered a fair amount of best-actor contenders who could follow in Nighy's footsteps. Foremost among them is Jonathan Majors. The up-and-coming actor already has a crowded 2023: He'll soon be seen facing off against Michael B. Jordan in "Creed III" and playing the supervillain Kang in Marvel properties like "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania" and "Loki." And that slate just got even stronger with the Sundance premiere of "Magazine Dreams," a troubled-loner drama in which Majors plays an amateur bodybuilder on the brink of snapping. Had the film been released a few months ago, Majors would have made this year's thin best-actor lineup for sure, but the right studio buyer could take advantage of his newfound Marvel momentum to muscle this formidable performance into the next race.
Other best-actor candidates that could come from the current Sundance crop include Gael Garcia Bernal, who could earn his first nomination for playing a gay luchador in the appealing "Cassandro," and David Strathairn, who toplines the modest, humane "A Little Prayer," about a father deciding whether to meddle in his son's extramarital affair. One point in Strathairn's favor is that his film will be released by Sony Pictures Classics, which has managed to land a well-liked veteran in the best-actor lineup three of the last four years (Nighy for "Living," Anthony Hopkins for "The Father" and Antonio Banderas for "Pain and Glory").
The top Sundance jury prize went to A.V. Rockwell's "A Thousand and One," which could earn best-actress attention for Teyana Taylor, who plays a defiant ex-con resorting to desperate measures to keep custody of her son. (Still, the film's planned March release from Focus Features will require some end-of-year reminders for forgetful voters.) Also buzzed about was Greta Lee, who could be in contention for A24's "Past Lives," about a Korean American woman reunited with her former lover; the film was so rapturously received that a best-picture push could be in the cards.
Will any of the year's biggest-selling films crash the Oscars race? Netflix spent $ 20 million to acquire the well-reviewed "Fair Play," which pits the "Bridgerton" star Phoebe Dynevor against the "Solo: A Star Wars Story" actor Alden Ehrenreich as co-workers whose affair curdles once she gets promoted. It's not the kind of starry auteur project that usually gets a big end-of-the-year campaign from Netflix, but if this battle of the sexes becomes a zeitgeisty hit, the streamer may give it a shot. Apple TV+ paid $ 20 million for the musical comedy "Flora and Son," from the "Once" director John Carney, while Searchlight shelled out more than $ 7 million for the Ben Platt vehicle "Theater Camp." At the very least, these two comedies feature delightful original-song contenders.
Sundance films could make the biggest splash is in the best-documentary race: All but one of this year's Oscar-nominated documentaries first debuted at the January festival, and even if you stripped Sundance of its star-driven narrative films, the strength of its docs would still preserve its status as a top-tier world festival.
This year, the most-talked-about docs were the award winners "Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project," about a storied Black poet; the Alzheimer's drama "The Eternal Memory"; "Beyond Utopia," which features compelling hidden-camera footage of North Koreans trying to defect; and "20 Days in Mariupol," about the Russian siege of a Ukrainian port city.

The Very Long Way to Carnegie Hall: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The pianist Leif Ove Andsnes is appearing at Carnegie with Dvorak's "Poetic Tone Pictures," a rarity being performed there for the first time.
Carnegie Hall might have hosted the premiere of Dvorak's Ninth Symphony in 1893, but it's not every day, 130 years later, that a major work by that Czech composer is heard there for the first time.
Still less, a solo piano cycle that lasts almost an hour. That's what the unerringly sophisticated Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes will offer on Tuesday, in a recital anchored by Dvorak's "Poetic Tone Pictures," thirteen character pieces, written in 1889, that Andsnes recently recorded for Sony.
Andsnes has known the work since he was a boy; his father had one of its few recordings in his collection. But he came to study it properly only in the time afforded by the pandemic.
"Most of my colleagues won't even know that Dvorak wrote this wonderful cycle for piano," Andsnes, 52, said in an interview. "There is such a strange reputation around his music because he wasn't a pianist, and people think that he didn't write very well for the instrument."
But, Andsnes added: "He uses the piano in a very colorful way, in a very versatile way, every piece has new textures, new techniques. For me, this cycle really stands as the great Czech piano cycle."
Tuesday's concert will be Andsnes's first solo recital at Carnegie Hall since 2015. Clive Gillinson, the hall's executive and artistic director, said that the lapse was a matter of bad luck -- injury, the pandemic -- but also, more tellingly, that it spoke to the breadth of interests that makes Andsnes special.
"We'll say we'd love to have you back, and he'll come back with an idea of collaborating with others, rather than just doing a piano recital," Gillinson said. When Andsnes has appeared at the hall, it's been in Brahms's Piano Quartets, the Grieg concerto with the Boston Symphony and a "Rite of Spring" as a duo with Marc-André Hamelin.
Andsnes's latest solo recital is a case study in sensitive programming. Czech nationality connects Dvorak to Janacek, whose early 20th-century sonata, "1.X.1905," commemorates a murdered political protester. That work's relevance to demonstrations today, particularly over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prompted Andsnes to surround it with a "Lamento" by Alexander Vustin, a Russian who was little known outside his country and died early in the pandemic, and a bagatelle by Valentin Silvestrov, whose music has come to represent Ukrainian resistance. Beethoven rounds out the program, because, as Andsnes put it, "Beethoven always seems to have a message."
In the interview, Andsnes discussed the "Poetic Tone Pictures" and more of Tuesday's program. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
The standard view of Dvorak's piano music, and especially his concerto, is that it is poorly written because he wasn't a virtuoso himself. Could we say instead that he wrote pretty well for someone who didn't play to a high standard?
Absolutely. Sometimes when you're not playing the instrument you might come up with solutions that are new, and unheard-of. I remember Christian Tetzlaff said a few years ago that, you know, who were the composers who wrote the groundbreaking new violin concertos? They were all pianists: Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Bartok. Nobody could imagine these shifts and sounds on the violin, and they didn't know its limitations.
I think Dvorak wrote wonderfully for the piano, most of the time. It's not as comfortably written as Chopin or Schumann or Debussy, but there's a lot of music like that. The imagination, the richness of melodic and harmonic invention and characterization is so wonderful, and so unique.
Did Dvorak intend the pieces to be played as a cycle?
I found this quote from him. He wrote to a friend after finishing these pieces that he's tried to be a poet, à la Schumann, but that it doesn't sound like Schumann. And then he says, I hope that someone will have the courage to play all the pieces continuously, because only by doing that could one really understand his intentions.
That was extremely interesting, because we're talking about an hour of music here. If he thought about it as a cycle, that's a very ambitious undertaking, and a much bigger cycle than any that were known at the time. Clara Schumann would always select pieces from her husband's music, rarely playing "Kreisleriana" as one, or "Carnaval" as one. Sure enough, one gets into a state of mind and it seems to work out well -- the contrasts between the pieces, and this wonderful farewell, "On the Holy Mountain," which is such a benediction. It's a real journey.
Listening to your recording, I wondered whether the music's fate has not just been about preconceptions about the writing, but the fact that an hourlong cycle is tricky to program.
Even the single pieces are not known. I played these pieces in Prague in November, and I met the daughter of Rudolf Firkusny, the great Czech pianist. She said, "Maybe I can remember that my father played the third piece a couple of times as an encore," but she didn't know the music. Can you imagine? Firkusny played so much Czech music, and was famous for playing the Piano Concerto.
Does the cycle have a narrative to it, or is it more a series of tableaux along the lines of Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition"?
More like that, maybe a picture of Czech life. What I love about the cycle is, you have very spiritual pieces, the mystery of "The Old Castle" and "Twilight Way," and on the other hand you have a piece called "Toying." Another piece is called "Tittle-Tattle." It's everyday life, which you also have in "Pictures at an Exhibition," or even in late Beethoven.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Do you have a favorite piece among the 13?
I love them all in very different ways, but there is one piece, the ninth, called "Serenade." It's such a great example of Dvorak's real strengths. It begins as such a trivial piece, it has this very simple melody, serenading a loved one, with a guitar accompaniment. There's almost no harmony in the beginning, and you wonder, is this really it?
It isn't, of course, because he suddenly changes the harmonies and it becomes so much richer. It gets to a middle section which is a sort of slow siciliano, which has a feeling of prayer, or a really beautiful love song, the most tender one can imagine. You just wonder how he went there, with the same melodic material. For me, he has such an ability to develop a very simple idea into a real jewel.
Dvorak always suffers a bit in comparison with Brahms, because they were contemporaries and admired each other. Brahms has this obvious counterpoint and resistance in the music, we always feel that every voice is so rich. Dvorak doesn't have that, and one can feel that the music is a little bit too easy to swallow. It depends on the performer to bring out all these subtleties.
Has it become more important for you to reflect the world in your playing?
It became quite special with this program. If one can find a relevant conversation with the music that we do and what is going on with the world, it's wonderful, but I wouldn't want to always look for something. It can be fabricated.
The Janacek was speaking to me about now. Like so many, I felt affected by what's going on, also being in this part of the world. As Norwegians we are a neighboring country to Russia, it really has affected so many of us everywhere; of course in the United States, too, but maybe even more in this part of the world.
And in grim times, we often turn to Beethoven.
Yes, so often there is a feeling of going through struggle, or fight in Beethoven's music, trying to find solutions, or answers, or victory -- somehow.

At the Movies, Women's Time Is Finally Here: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: In a good movie year -- and whatever you may have heard, 2022 was such a year -- I find it an agony to compile a Top 10 list. There are just too many good and great films, too many titles that I want to celebrate. Being overwhelmed by a bounty of excellence is a pleasure, one that I often experience at film festivals. And lately, whether I'm at home or at a festival, I have been struck by how much of this abundance is from women onscreen and behind the camera.
We are experiencing a sea change with women and movies, a shift in numbers but also in consciousness. Female-driven movies, from women filmmakers and not, open weekly and are greeted as a matter of course rather than as aberrations; some dominate the box office, and a handful are enlivening the awards season. Despite continuing biases and barriers, women are now directing movies with a variety of budgets, topics and casts. It's made my job as a critic more exciting.
It is, I learned long ago, demoralizing and alienating to watch film after film in which women watch men conquer worlds. And, yes, men continue to dominate American cinema. The producers and directors guilds have failed to nominate a single woman filmmaker for their latest awards, and on Tuesday the Academy Awards largely followed suit, although Sarah Polley's "Women Talking" was a surprise best picture nominee. All the Top 20 domestic box office earners last year were directed by men, a gender imbalance that's been the norm for a long time, notwithstanding exceptions like "Wonder Woman." Yet what struck me about 2022 were the number of movies headlined and directed by women that made an impact, culturally and economically.
Women seemed to be taking the representational fight in every kind of movie last year, whether it was Michelle Yeoh tearing through "Everything Everywhere All at Once," Keke Palmer running off with "Nope" or the metaphorically rich army of women warriors leading the charge in "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever." There were more female fighters in Gina Prince-Bythewood's adventure drama, "The Woman King," which opened at No. 1 in September. The next weekend, filmgoers could catch "Don't Worry Darling," Olivia Wilde's divisive freakout about a woman breaking free of brutally reactionary femininity. It too opened at No. 1; the next weekend, it was supplanted by "Smile," a horror flick about a woman facing a demon.
I couldn't remember when (or if) three female-led movies had topped the box office consecutively, so after "Smile" opened, I asked Tom Brueggemann, who tracks the box office for IndieWire. He established that the last time had been in 2009 with the release of "The Twilight Saga: New Moon," "The Blind Side" and "The Princess and the Frog," which features Disney's first Black princess. "Frog" aside, these films aren't especially memorable, and their stories are cut from shabby cloth. Yet taken together, their popularity suggested that something significant had started to shift in the movie world, even if only about a third of speaking characters in the Top 100 popular films were female, per one study.
SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED in 2009: Kathryn Bigelow's war movie "The Hurt Locker" opened to ecstatic reviews and decent box office, and was soon on the march toward the Academy Awards. Such campaigns are slogs, but this one paid off when in March 2010 Bigelow became the first woman to win best director. By the end of the night, she had a second Oscar when the movie won best picture, twin triumphs that brought many of us watching at home to our feet. I hate the Oscars when I don't love them, but that night I swooned. Surely, I thought, this would change everything for women in the industry, forcing open doors and checkbooks. It didn't exactly happen that way; I didn't realize that change had already started sneaking in.
Soon after the Bigelow Oscars, as I think of them, I wrote about her and the industry's history in an essay that was, effectively, a version of the same one I and other exasperated feminist film lovers have been writing forever. In the essay, I added this sentence from the Celluloid Ceiling, an annual report on women in film from the academic and researcher Martha M. Lauzen: "Women comprised 7 percent of all directors working on the Top 250 films of 2009." My intention was for those numbers to serve as a stark, sobering reminder of Bigelow's exceptionalism; now, though, the numbers make a stark contrast with the findings in Lauzen's latest study, which found that in 2022 women accounted for 18 percent of directors working on the Top 250.
Another study released this month focuses only on the Top 100 domestic releases, which is generally where many of the biggest, priciest studio movies can be found. This study was from Stacy L. Smith and the U.S.C. Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, and it framed its findings fairly pessimistically. The Annenberg report noted there had been "small gains for women directors in popular films," but it also, understandably, concluded that the pace of change had been slow. The flurry of news stories on the studies struck similarly downbeat notes, typified by Variety announcing "Failure to Change: Two Reports Examine Hollywood's Lack of Progress Improving Diversity on Movie Sets."
The data are irrefutable and inarguable. Egregiously, women, a population majority, remain a minority throughout the movie world for one reason and one reason only: discrimination based on sex, which has been illegal in the United States since 1964 but remains business as usual in the industry. Men continue to get more financing, more opportunities, more cool gigs, more second chances. Men also continue to fail upward and bore audiences with the same tired old stories. Yet what these truths and all the dispiriting statistics don't reveal are other, subtler and more seismic changes that are difficult to quantify, changes that make me feel uncharacteristically optimistic about the state of the art and the industry both.
Some of my hopefulness can be traced to what took place between the 2009 study and the 2022 ones, because here's what happened in addition to Bigelow winning her Oscars: "Bridesmaids" became a smash hit; Ava DuVernay became the first Black woman to win best director at the Sundance Film Festival; Pixar released "Brave," its first movie with a female protagonist; "The Hunger Games" popularized a new American heroic prototype; "Frozen" was a monster hit and so was "Gravity"; DuVernay directed "Selma," which was released by Paramount Pictures and was nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards -- and while she didn't receive a nod for best director, she answered that slight by building an entertainment empire.
Also! Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron kicked butt; Melissa McCarthy and Amy Schumer made noise and bank; the "Star Wars" franchise was resuscitated with a female Jedi; the new, female-led "Ghostbusters" provoked a revealing misogynist backlash; "Inside Out" was a hit and made a lot of people cry, including the guy next to me who sobbed on his girlfriend's shoulder; Viola Davis won a best supporting actress Oscar (for "Fences"); women called out Harvey Weinstein, who will likely die in prison; DuVernay made "A Wrinkle in Time," the first movie with a $ 100 million budget directed by a Black woman; Nia DaCosta directed "Candyman," becoming the first Black woman with a movie opening at No. 1; Chloé Zhao won an Academy Award for best director ("Nomadland"), the first woman of color to do so.
Despite these markers, my optimism may also seem surprising given the industry's current state. It's bad, very bad, we are repeatedly told. The rise of streaming and decline in theatrical attendance thrust the industry into another existential crisis even before the pandemic; it's worse now. Theaters that survived the 2020 shutdown continue to struggle because studios are releasing a third fewer movies than they did pre-Covid and no one wants to go out unless it's to watch another franchise blockbuster or horror flick. The art-house world, which depends on older audiences and scrounges for financial scraps, has been particularly hard-hit.
The situation is undeniably more complex, and it bears repeating that the movies have gone through -- and survived -- one disaster after another their entire history, whether the crisis was Thomas Edison's efforts to monopolize moving pictures at the start of the 20th century, the midcentury rise of television, the decline of old Hollywood or the decline of New Hollywood. It's an awful, difficult business. Yet while Americans have been getting out of the habit of regular theatergoing for decades and seem disinclined to change course any time soon (particularly during a pandemic), people still like movies whatever size the screen.
WOMEN HELPED INVENT CINEMA but were largely shut out of Hollywood as directors from the 1930s through the '60s. Other women, mostly white, continued to star in films mostly directed by (white) men, a gendered division of labor that helped create deep-seated mental models: Women were to be looked at, to paraphrase the feminist scholar Laura Mulvey, while men belonged to the world of action, whether they were playing the hero onscreen or calling the shots behind the camera. A small group of independent women nevertheless managed to make off-Hollywood films decade after decade despite the cultural and economic odds, and the indifference, contempt and abuse of kingmakers and their mouthpieces, including in journalism.
The end of the old studio system with its galaxies of players under contract proved disastrous for women stars, and the macho ethos of New Hollywood that followed in its wake wasn't always welcoming, though Barbra Streisand, Jane Fonda, Jill Clayburgh, Ellen Burstyn, Sally Field, Cicely Tyson and others did find juicy roles and acclaim. By the late 1970s, blockbusters like "Jaws" and "Star Wars" had ushered in a different, supersized mainstream business, one that filled the next decades with buddy movies and testosterone-charged blowouts. But both in Hollywood and away from it, handfuls of women like Elaine May, Barbara Loden, Joyce Chopra, Madeline Anderson and Julia Reichert were also making films. And while the rise of Indiewood brought us a lot of guys in baseball caps and the House of Miramax, it introduced new female stars and, in time, increasing numbers of women directors.
Change has since come to the movies, including, importantly, a change in consciousness about women and film. There has been a shift in "the mental horizons" of the age, to borrow a phrase from the French historian Lucien Febvre. Today, women receive directing offers and gigs that were once unimaginable, and the non-troll world seems to accept that women can star in all types of movies and that women can make movies, too. Journalists and civilians alike routinely call out the industry's sexism, and they keep tabs on representation at studios and festivals. A newly resurgent feminism, social media, demographic change and convulsions in the business have all helped make this shift possible and so have the women directors, producers, agents, cinematographers, casting agents and many others who've done the hard work.
In the past, I have sometimes thought that while men are seen as auteurs, women are problems: Not long ago, the received industry wisdom was they couldn't direct action flicks (as a female studio executive told me); they made chick flicks (a term often used condescendingly and pejoratively); and their box office triumphs were always a surprise (as innumerable news reports have insisted). This troublemaker rap hasn't disappeared, of course, as is obvious from the false outrage that enveloped Wilde's "Don't Worry Darling" last year because she and her male star, Harry Styles, had become involved. It was clear to any thinking person that Wilde's gender had helped turn that putative scandal into news. It was a dreary and bleak moment. Yet while once I might have gone out of my way to avoid panning a movie by a woman because of her unicorn status, I didn't hesitate this time. True equality means that women should be able to succeed, fail and move on, just like men; they should be allowed to be as brilliant, flawed and human.
It can seem deeply unfair that more women and members of other marginalized groups have made inroads into this stubbornly exclusionary, historically racist and sexist business at a time when fewer people seem actually to care about movies. And, in truth, one reason women have been able to make inroads is precisely because the industry no longer resembles the highly centralized, blindingly white, overwhelmingly male-dominated enterprise it was for decades, when independence was rare and the only power most women wielded in Hollywood was as stars. One person's crisis can be another's opportunity, and women have continued to push forward even as the rest of the movie world has flailed.
I know that my optimism may seem strange or counterintuitive or just wishful thinking. I get it. Not all that long ago, I thought it would be best if the entire machine blew up, that the big studios just got it over with and died, making room for others to build something different and better. Certainly the movie industry seems to be doing a fine job of self-combusting. Yet the truth is that despite the statistics and awards, the movie world looks different than it did 30, 20, even 10 years ago. The world looks different. There is, as I've suggested, no one reason for the shift in how we think about women and film, but it is a good and hopeful shift. Change has been slow. But change is here because women have followed their muses, honed their craft and heeded their voices no matter the hurdles before them and, in doing so, they have changed ideas about cinematic representation, about who gets to be the hero on set and onscreen. Bigelow, as she reminded me in a 2009 interview, had never made a studio film. Over the past decade, DuVernay has pursued a different path and found a way to work with the system while changing it. They and so many other women are making and remaking worlds in their own image.

That Vertigo of Mixing Life and Art: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The French director translates her experiences into critically lauded dramas like "One Fine Morning," about her father's death and her own new love.
When the French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love was about 15, her boyfriend moved to South America. Brokenhearted, she made an impulsive decision: She cut off all her hair.
"I needed to do something radical, to be a radically different person," she said. "I had Jean Seberg in mind."
Soon after, a school theater teacher recommended that she audition for an ensemble film being cast locally. The project was "Late August, Early September," directed by Olivier Assayas. Hansen-Love, sporting her sleek new hairstyle, was chosen for a role. She went on to act in another Assayas film and begin a relationship with him.
"The haircut is a crucial moment, like a turning point," she recalled on a recent video call from her home in Montreuil, outside Paris. "Maybe it's just a story that I tell myself, but for me, there will always be this idea that I needed to be left alone by my boyfriend, and I needed to be sad to become who I am."
Hansen-Love, now 41, has a complex relationship with her past. The eight features she has written and directed pull so heavily from her own experiences that they are often described as autofiction. Take the coming-of-age "Goodbye First Love," released in the United States in 2012: After the teenage protagonist's lover decamps to South America, she chops her hair to Seberg length, accepts a new job and falls in love with her mentor.
Hansen-Love's latest film, the meditative drama "One Fine Morning," is equally wrung from life: It captures the recent period when the filmmaker was caring for her ailing father, Ole Hansen-Love, while beginning a new romance.
The film stars Léa Seydoux as Sandra, a Parisian translator who shifts between the roles of caretaker, mother and lover. Her father, Georg (Pascal Greggory), is a former philosophy professor suffering from Benson's syndrome, a rare neurodegenerative disease. As his health declines, Sandra oversees his move into a care facility and helps parcel out his belongings to former students.
Critics took note of the film's careful rhythms and quiet power. In The Times, Manohla Dargis called it "beautifully balanced, persuasive and moving," and Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair found the final scene "softly profound" and Seydoux's performance "finely observed and alert."
On a video call, Seydoux characterized Sandra as "always at someone's service" and "trying to please everyone." The actress recognized the parallels between Sandra and Hansen-Love, but she also felt ownership over the role. "There are things about Sandra that are mine," Seydoux said, and added that Hansen-Love "didn't say that I was playing a version of her. But she said, 'It's my father's story."'
Hansen-Love came up with the idea for "One Fine Morning" several years ago after she, her daughter and her new partner stopped by Ole's nursing home. It was an emotional visit, and Hansen-Love collected herself afterward by climbing the steps at Sacré-Coeur for a view of the city. "This is really something only tourists do," she clarified, and added that they went just because the lookout was nearby.
Once the trio reached the top, however, Hansen-Love was struck by the idea for a film that would distill her conflicting feelings. "Two things were happening at the same time in my life, and they were very opposite. One was very painful, and one was certainly complicated but happy. And I made that observation: how much it helped that I was in love to overcome -- or to cope with -- the experience of seeing my father slowly dying."
Hansen-Love recreates this visit with Ole and the subsequent ascent at Sacré-Coeur to a precise degree in "One Fine Morning." She even shot the scene in the clinic where her father once resided. (Ole died early in the pandemic, soon after Hansen-Love wrote the screenplay.) She hoped the film would encapsulate the "secret dialogue" between tragedy and joy that crystallized for her that day.
"Life sometimes gives us reasons to despair, and on the other hand, it gives us reasons to hope," she said.
Hansen-Love grew up in a small, ground-floor apartment in Paris near a Metro station. One of her clearest childhood memories is the sound of the train cars screeching away from the stop. During holiday seasons, her parents, who both taught philosophy, would shepherd her and her elder brother to her grandmother's remote house in the mountains, near the source of the Loire River.
The region sometimes appears in Hansen-Love's stories. Her second feature, "Father of My Children" (2010), depicts a Parisian family weekending at their ivied country estate, and "Goodbye First Love" contains full scenes set at her childhood haunts, like the Loire riverbank.
"I think the theme of water, and rivers, and going back to some source, whether it be a geographic or a spiritual one -- that's something that nourishes my work," she said.
For many years, Hansen-Love was tied to Assayas. Not only did they share a life, but their work also seemed to be in conversation. You might liken them to the American filmmaking partners Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, or the married French new wave directors Agnès Varda and Jacques Demy.
Hansen-Love and Assayas never married, despite accounts to the contrary ("fake information," she said with a laugh), and they broke up around seven years ago. They share a 13-year-old daughter.
A deep thinker and a cordial, ruminative conversationalist, Hansen-Love is notably private about her romantic partnerships. Given the richness of her storytelling, it's tempting to pull clues from her work, like "Bergman Island" (2021), which follows two filmmakers whose relationship is on the rocks.
I asked Hansen-Love if she grew tired of outsiders inquiring into her personal life after seeing her films. "I don't feel I'm allowed to complain, because I think it's my fault," she said. "I've never tried to hide that my films were partly inspired by experiences from my life." In a nod to her philosophically minded parents, she added, "I grew up with two people obsessed with the quest for truth, so it's very difficult for me to lie about it."
"Bergman Island" could be seen as Hansen-Love's artist statement on the topic. The drama intercuts scenes of a filmmaker (played by Vicky Krieps) with episodes from the story she is crafting, and in doing so explores how the membrane between art and life can be porous.
As Hansen-Love put it, the film is about "that vertigo of mixing life and fiction, and not knowing where you are, and who you are."
In "One Fine Morning," Sandra takes refuge from her daughterly duties in an incipient affair with Clément (Melvil Poupaud), an enigmatic married cosmochemist. Playing the paramour, Poupaud exudes aloofness and a touch of danger.
Hansen-Love had been enamored with Poupaud since she saw him in Éric Rohmer's "A Summer's Tale" in 1996. "I feel lucky that I was never able to offer him a part before. Sometimes I've wondered if it's not because I wanted to keep our relationship virgin for this part," she said.
By phone, Poupaud -- who knew Hansen-Love socially -- said that he had been eager to work with her ever since seeing her debut feature, "All Is Forgiven" (2007). He was moved by her work "almost in a magical way," he said. "No big events, no big scenes, no drama, but something from real life."
I mentioned that Clément was a dead ringer for Hansen-Love's current partner, the filmmaker Laurent Perreau, and Poupaud agreed. "When we did the test -- we tried the clothing and that look of my character -- I'd never met her boyfriend," he said. "And one day he came on set and I was like, wow, that's exactly who I am. She had done all this in a secret way," but also in a manner that was "very precise and determined."
Both Poupaud and Seydoux said that Hansen-Love's process included capturing many takes of each shot.
"Sometimes you feel like she's waiting for the scene to match with what she lived, or what she really has in mind," Poupaud said, "and since we don't know what she lived and what she really has in mind, it's like waiting for the good moment, the good move, the good mood to appear during the work."
Describing Hansen-Love as an intellectual, Seydoux recalled, "She knows exactly what she wants. Like, if you scratch your head, for example, in a take, she's like, 'No, we'll do it again. You scratched your head."'
Of her eight features, Hansen-Love considers only two or three to be "kind of self-portraits." Yet many of the others can be understood as studies of people dear to her. "All Is Forgiven" was inspired by Hansen-Love's uncle; "Father of My Children," about a film producer who goes bankrupt and dies by suicide, is a sketch of the French producer Humbert Balsan, who died in 2005.
She also makes portraits of immediate family members: "Eden" (2015), which Hansen-Love wrote alongside her brother, Sven, chronicled his life as a D.J., and "Things to Come" (2016), starring Isabelle Huppert, was based on the experiences of the filmmaker's mother.
Hansen-Love said she often wavered in doubt before beginning scripts, thinking, "Maybe I should really not write this film. Maybe it's too painful, it's too close to my life." But the angst is also fuel.
"I really grew up with such a heavy melancholy, which was transmitted to me and which I transmit back into my films," she said. "When I do that, it emancipates me. When I put it in my films, I get rid of it."

Snubs and Surprises Among Oscar Nominees: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: It's a record-setting year for performers of Asian descent. In the actress race, there's room for Andrea Riseborough but not Viola Davis or Danielle Deadwyler.
The sci-fi hit "Everything Everywhere All at Once" led the Oscar nominations on Tuesday, but many other presumed contenders fell startlingly short. As your Projectionist, here's my analysis of Tuesday morning's biggest surprises and omissions.
A record-setting year for Asian actors.
Though two of the last three best-picture winners were directed by Asian filmmakers, the academy has fallen short when it comes to nominating performers of Asian descent: Films like "Parasite" and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" failed to earn even a single nomination for their acclaimed actors. But Tuesday's nomination haul, which saw "Everything Everywhere" cast members Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Stephanie Hsu all making the cut alongside "The Whale" supporting actress Hong Chau, set a record for the most actors of Asian descent ever nominated in a single year. The 60-year-old Yeoh became only the second Asian woman to be nominated for the best actress Oscar: The first, Merle Oberon, hid her Asian ancestry when she was nominated all the way back in 1935.
Andrea Riseborough crashes the party.
A single awards campaign can involve a monthslong gantlet of interviews, red carpets, screening Q&As and voter handshakes, and not every contender can charge all those appearances to a corporate credit card. You have to admire the actress Andrea Riseborough, then, for pioneering a brand-new, low-cost awards strategy: Though her microbudget indie "To Leslie" was underseen and her performance as a dissolute lottery winner was barely on the radar of most awards pundits, Riseborough relied on a network of famous friends -- among them, Edward Norton, Gwyneth Paltrow and Sarah Paulson -- to take to social media and tout the movie en masse just as voting for the Oscar nominations began. That strategy earned the 41-year-old British actress her first nomination, and proved that when it comes to Oscar season, it ain't over till it's over.
Viola Davis and Danielle Deadwyler miss out.
Riseborough's rise brought the best-actress hopes of two other contenders to an abrupt end: "The Woman King" star Viola Davis and "Till" actress Danielle Deadwyler were both shut out of a best actress category that many pundits assumed would be mostly made up of women of color. Deadwyler's deeply felt performance as the mother of Emmett Till had suffered a few notable snubs this season from the Independent Spirit Awards and Golden Globes, but Davis had cruised through the season so far, earning nominations from the Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice Awards and BAFTA. Only Tuesday did the Oscar-winning actress fall short.
In the best-actor category, five fresh faces.
Though the best actress race often favors ingénues, male up-and-comers aren't always regarded so warmly: The best actor category is typically stacked with veterans over 40, and the same famous names are nominated an awful lot. In fact, the last time the entire best-actor lineup was made up of first-time nominees was in 1935, when only three men were even nominated. Tuesday's lineup, then, is the freshest in ages: Every single man in the best actor category is a first-time nominee, from 26-year-old Paul Mescal to 73-year-old Bill Nighy, and a total 16 of the 20 acting nominees all received their first nod.
Women are ignored in the best-director race.
After back-to-back years when a female filmmaker won the best director Oscar, that trend came to a decisive halt Tuesday when no women were even nominated in that category. Among the biggest contenders were Gina Prince-Bythewood (whose action epic "The Woman King" was snubbed across the board), "Aftersun" director Charlotte Wells (whose leading man, Mescal, made the best actor cut), and Sarah Polley, whose film "Women Talking" earned two nominations, for adapted screenplay and best picture. Meanwhile, "The Fabelmans" auteur Steven Spielberg earned his ninth best-director nomination, tying Martin Scorsese for the second most nominations in that category, behind William Wyler's 13.
Streamers hold on, but just barely.
After Apple became the first streaming service to win the best picture Oscar with "CODA," the studio was nearly blanked this year, picking up just one nomination in the top six categories, for Brian Tyree Henry's supporting performance in the Jennifer Lawrence drama "Causeway." The deep-pocketed Netflix fared somewhat better, but experienced no shortage of agita along the way: After its big contender "Bardo" bombed at the Venice Film Festival, the streamer turned its attention to "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery," though like the first "Knives Out," it could score no more than a screenplay nomination. But "Blonde" star Ana de Armas did make it into the best actress lineup, and another Netflix movie surged into the best-picture race at just the right time ...
'All Quiet' makes plenty of noise.
War may be hell, but with "All Quiet on the Western Front" earning nine nominations Tuesday, Netflix must be in heaven. The German-language adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's classic World War I novel was a favorite of many Oscar voters I spoke to, and could even be a formidable threat to nomination leader "Everything Everywhere All At Once," since it offers a more traditional awards pick than that multiverse-jumping mind-bender. (The 1930 adaptation of Remarque's novel won best picture at the third Academy Awards, don't forget.)
Michelle Williams makes it in.
When pundits first saw Michelle Williams play Steven Spielberg's mom in "The Fabelmans," they were convinced she was our new supporting-actress front-runner. Then, just a few weeks later, word broke that instead of gunning for that easy win, Williams would be campaigned as the film's leading actress. It was a laudable rejection of the category fraud that has become all too common during award season, in which a star with a sizable amount of screen time slums it in a supporting category, but then the Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA both snubbed her in the best actress category, causing no small amount of uncertainty about her ultimate fate. Tuesday, the Oscars came through for Williams in the best actress category, and not for the first time, either: When SAG and BAFTA both snubbed her for "Blue Valentine" (2010), the academy still swooped in with a last-minute save.
Sequels muscle into the best picture race.
Mainstream moviegoers love franchise entertainments, but Oscar voters are more skeptical: Only seven sequels have ever been nominated for best picture. Tuesday added two more to the mix, as "Top Gun: Maverick" earned a solid six nominations (including an adapted screenplay nod that produced an audible reaction in the room where the nominations were read) and James Cameron's "Avatar: The Way of Water" took four. ("Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" managed five nominations, including a supporting-actress nod for Angela Bassett, but was shut out of the best picture race.) Neither "Top Gun" nor "Avatar" managed a directing nomination, but hopefully their makers can be consoled with the films' billion-dollar grosses instead.

Full text: Hip-hop can sometimes discourage rappers from openly embracing their heroes, but Drake wears his enthusiasms loudly and, this past week, literally.
There's an internet-famous photo of Cam'ron wearing a pink mink jacket with a matching headband, holding a pink flip phone to his ear. It was taken at a Baby Phat fashion show in 2003, when the Harlem rapper was in his peak peacock era -- a hardrock dandy oozing loucheness and insouciance, blending an aura of toughness with devil-may-care liberation.
Drake was 16 when that future meme hit the internet, a Canadian teen actor with rap star dreams. He hadn't yet formed the aesthetic identity that would make him the most influential hip-hop performer of the past decade. He was, first and foremost, a fan.
He still is. At the Apollo Theater on Saturday night, at the first of two shows he performed for SiriusXM subscribers, he brought out Cam'ron and the Diplomats for a guest set. For that part of the show, Drake wore Cam'ron's pink mink jacket and headband -- the actual garments. This was something more than homage, and also something more than mere enthusiasm. This was Drake making an in-joke to the hip-hop internet of the early to mid-2000s, while acknowledging how fans of all stripes would love to briefly inhabit the skin of their heroes. Given the unique opportunity, Drake chose to become the meme.
Drake is a social media sophisticate, a fine walker of the almost completely obliterated line between fandom and creation. No contemporary pop star has so effectively weaponized the ways in which boosterism and distaste coexist in online spaces. Drake may be the most popular musician whose fans are not an organized troop, like the Swifties or the BeyHive -- that's because Drake fandom is more interactive. Even his biggest detractors turn their contempt into shareable bites, and Drake reacts to that dismissal with cool élan, incorporating it into his narrative when it serves him.
To be a fan in this era is to effectively write yourself into your idol's story, or to make your idol's art somehow about you. And to be a truly modern celebrity is to acknowledge the ways in which you are being consumed, positive and negative alike, and feed those mouths accordingly.
This past week, Drake played with that fire twice. His Apollo concert was mostly a hits and B-sides revue. But he animatedly and joyously danced and rapped along while the Diplomats performed "I Really Mean It," "Dipset Anthem" and Jim Jones's "We Fly High," a literal display of how fandom has shaped his own career arc. A few days earlier, he demonstrated the same point in more ostentatious fashion. In the newly released video for "Jumbotron ___ Poppin," a song from his 2022 collaborative album with 21 Savage, Drake wore several iconic pieces of jewelry custom-made for Pharrell Williams and recently sold by Joopiter, an auction platform founded by Williams.
Drake spent around $ 2.7 million on the items, including the signature 2005 N.E.R.D chain with pastel links created by Jacob & Co., a yellow gold diamond-encrusted dual skateboard pendant chain (also by Jacob & Co.) and a 14-karat yellow gold Sony PSP.
There is an additional layer of subtext here. In a 2010 episode of the MTV show "When I Was 17," Drake revealed that, as a teenager, he bought a microphone purportedly signed by Pusha T on eBay. At that time, Drake was a committed fan of Clipse, the duo of Pusha T and his brother Malice. (Williams, as part of the production duo the Neptunes, helped usher Clipse into the world.)
But in later years, Pusha T became Drake's primary antagonist, revealing via a song that Drake had fathered a son, and also standing fast with Kanye West during the Kanye-Drake cold war (until recently, of course). On the MTV show, Drake said he used the mic so much as a teenager that the autograph wore off (and conceded that it might not have even been real). But in an interview with Rap Radar in 2019, he said that he still owned the mic. It had ceased to be Pusha T's; it had become his own.
That Drake has never been shy about how he soaks up influence sets him apart from most of his peers. (It is something he shares with West, his primary idol turned rival.) He's long been an enthusiastic booster of younger artists working in new styles, and speaks openly of how his elders shaped him.
In hip-hop, where even covering another rapper's song is considered heresy, this kind of naked fandom is often discouraged. And as might be expected, Drake's sartorial love notes this past week resulted in a new raft of memes speculating about what other sorts of accoutrements he might buy in order to insert himself into key moments in hip-hop history: the paper towel bandanna from Jadakiss's "Knock Yourself Out" video, the gun used by Shyne in the 1999 Club New York shooting.
But being a fan of Drake means, in some way, accepting that identity is constructed by trying on pre-existing ones and seeing what fits. Embedded in the act of putting on the coat or the necklace is the knowledge that it eventually comes off -- that's when you learn who you've become.

Chippendale Building Updates to Draw Workers Inside: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Now known as 550 Madison, the historic Chippendale Building has been updated with a new gym, a full kitchen and an outdoor garden to welcome people back to the office.
The Chippendale building, officially called 550 Madison, was designed by Philip Johnson and completed in 1984, and its neoclassical arch and pink granite were hard to miss.
Once home to Sony and AT&T, it remains an eyesore to some, but to others, like James Harris, who has worked in the building since 1996 and is currently the lead safety director, there is "something special" about the building that sits on East 55th Street and Madison Avenue. As people return to the office after working remotely for the past few years, the building is now aiming to offer workers something they can't get in their living rooms or neighborhood coffee shop -- "collaboration and being in the office," Erik Horvat, the head of real estate at Olayan America, an investment group, said.
The developers at 550 Madison Avenue are banking on amenities -- a gym, a full kitchen, an outdoor garden.
Not everyone is a fan of the renovations, especially preservationists hoping to keep the building in its postmodern state. In 2017, the architecture critic Alexandra Lange said the initial proposed renovations to the building's facade cut Johnson's "groundbreaking postmodern tower off at the knees," likening it to an Apple store. A Change.org petition "aggressively dedicated" to the building's preservation garnered just over 2,550 signatures. (The building received landmark status in the summer of 2018, with the committee calling 550 Madison one of the world's "most important postmodernist buildings.")
"When working on an architecturally important building like 550 Madison there are always passionate opinions from people who truly care about the city's built environment. We listened and learned, pivoting to address feedback from the preservation community. The process ultimately led to a better product," Mr. Horvat later said in a statement.
The renovation is a collaborative project: The architecture firm Snøhetta took on the design for the outdoor garden space, while the Rockwell Group designed the amenity spaces. The insurance firm Chubb and the French luxury brand Hermès signed a deal for space in the building, but will workers want to come back?
These interviews have been lightly edited for clarity.
Erik Horvat, head of real estate, Olayan America
There is no magic pill that you take that makes everybody come back to work. What I've seen be successful so far for us was you create healthy, beautiful spaces that people want to work at. That's the best you can do right now. Do people still want the flexibility to be home for the guy that needs to check the sink that doesn't work? Yeah. But, ultimately, you'll bring more people back to the office if you have space.
There are a lot of challenges in the office building, and I would tell you that this is the type of office building everybody I think in the city would hope to have.
What's become bigger with office buildings since the pandemic: It's health and wellness, and it's amenities. Those are two things people believe will bring people back.
Michelle Delk, partner and landscape architect at Snøhetta
One thing that was really interesting to us when we began looking at the space was how it could become both a complement and a contrast to other publicly accessible spaces in the neighborhood. We considered other privately owned public spaces, POPS, in the area as well as publicly accessible spaces like the MoMA sculpture garden nearby. When we started looking at those spaces, there was a lot of interest, but we did also recognize that a lot of them were fully enclosed. So we began to think, how can this be as four seasons as possible, but be a little bit different?
And so we have always seen the public space as a space meant to invite people back over and over again. So variety, intrigue, seasonality -- that access to being outside in all four seasons.
In terms of the future worker -- as well as others in the neighborhood -- we're just hoping that it provides a sense of pause, a sense of retreat, whether that's the way you start your day. Maybe you go and sit in the garden before you go into work, or if you're working in the building and you come out to have a break or lunch or after work, that it feels like it's a part of your every day rather than something that is forgotten or overlooked or that you only use every now and again.
James Harris, the lead fire and life safety director at Mulligan Security
I was a relatively young lad when I came here. I wasn't in security for a long period of time. I had just left Wall Street as an accountant, and I was looking for a job, and I fell into security. I bounced around from place to place, and when I landed in this particular building -- it was something special about the building. I could feel it. I never experienced that walking into any other building.
I was able to go to college and take courses to help enrich my getting ahead up the ladder. And what I enjoyed most of all was coming in contact with people. It's just exciting to be a part of this and to be able to offer my spiritualness or how I feel to the new tenants that'll be coming on board.
We put forth a great effort and training to be the best customer service personnel you can get. And we want them to feel like we feel by doing the job we do. And when they walk through, you want them to feel like, "Wow, I'm in a whole different universe." We just want them to come in and feel right at home whenever they come.
Brad Zuger, Rockwell Group
To us, wellness is more than the ventilation and light -- and we know that's important. But for us, it's also about joy and creating spectacular spaces where people can get together, particularly post-Covid.
It's interesting to think about the array of spaces we have here and how they sort of change or adapt or allow for flexibility in how people are getting together and meeting and gathering. That was important to us. Through all these different spaces, there are a lot of layers that we've incorporated into the design. Above left, 550 Madison. Above, the building's grand hall.

Yukihiro Takahashi, 70, Drummer And Pioneer of Electronic Pop Music: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A drummer and singer, he was best known as a member of Yellow Magic Orchestra, one of Japan's most successful bands and a major influence on hip-hop, techno and New Wave.
Yukihiro Takahashi, a drummer and vocalist whose wide artistic range and gleeful embrace of music technology made him a leading figure in Japan's pop scene for nearly 50 years, most prominently with the Yellow Magic Orchestra, one of his country's most successful musical acts, died on Jan. 11 in Karuizawa, Japan. He was 70.
The cause was aspiration pneumonia, a complication of a brain tumor, his management company said in a statement.
Mr. Takahashi and Yellow Magic Orchestra, which he founded in 1978 with the musicians Ryuichi Sakamoto and Haruomi Hosono, were often ranked alongside the German electronic group Kraftwerk as pioneers in electronic music and significant influences on emergent genres like hip-hop, New Wave and techno.
Yellow Magic Orchestra was among the first bands to employ in live shows devices like the Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer and the Moog II-C synthesizer, which they used to complement Mr. Hosono's funky guitar and Mr. Takahashi's tight, driving drums.
Unlike their German counterparts, who leaned into the avant-garde nature of electronic sound and referred to themselves as automatons, Yellow Magic Orchestra found ways to bend it toward pop music, blending in elements of Motown, disco and synth-pop.
In a 1980 appearance on the television show "Soul Train," the band performed a souped-up version of Archie Bell and the Drells' "Tighten Up," after which a bemused Don Cornelius, the show's host, interviewed Mr. Takahashi. Kraftwerk, it might go without saying, never appeared on "Soul Train."

Mr. Takahashi "was remarkably skilled at taking what were obviously artificial, technologically mediated sounds and using them to build songs that sound fully and organically human," Michael K. Bourdaghs, a professor of Japanese literature and culture at the University of Chicago, said in a phone interview.
The band and its tech-inflected sound arrived at just the right time. Japan had long since remade itself as a postwar economic engine, but by the late 1970s it was becoming something else: a global emblem of techno-utopianism and futuristic cool. Sony released the Walkman in 1979, just as Kenzo Takada and Issey Miyake were taking over Paris fashion runways with their playful, visionary designs.
Yellow Magic Orchestra's eponymous debut album, released in 1978, sold more than 250,000 copies; its 1980 sophomore release, "Solid State Survivor," sold some one million. Six of the band's seven studio albums reached the top five in the Japanese pop charts, and all of them provided fodder for covers and samples far beyond Japan.
Afrika Bambaataa, 2 Live Crew, J Dilla and De La Soul were among the many acts who borrowed liberally from Yellow Magic Orchestra's archive. Michael Jackson remade its song "Behind the Mask," though his version was not released until 2010, after his death.
The band's music also inspired composers of early video game soundtracks who were looking for electronic sounds that could remain compelling even after hours of play. Yellow Magic Orchestra titled the first track on its debut album "Computer Game 'Theme from The Circus,"' and Mr. Takahashi later wrote music for several games.
He and his bandmates were already established musicians when they formed Yellow Magic Orchestra, and they continued to release solo projects during the group's six-year run. Mr. Takahashi released some 20 albums during his career, not counting numerous remastered reissues and live recordings.
Neither he nor the band ever sat still artistically. His first group, the Sadistic Mika Band, brought glam and prog rock to Japan in the early 1970s and was among the first Japanese acts to achieve success outside the country -- it toured Britain with Roxy Music and played on the BBC.
Mr. Takahashi's 1978 solo album, "Saravah!," produced by Mr. Sakamoto, drew on bossa nova and reggae influences, while the album "Yellow Magic Orchestra" later that year tweaked Orientalist stereotypes, most notably in a cheeky cover of Martin Denny's tiki-inspired "Firecracker."
Both before and after Yellow Magic Orchestra, Mr. Takahashi was a frequent and eager collaborator, forming bands on the fly and bringing in friends to play on individual tracks. He often worked with the British guitarist and singer Bill Nelson, as well as Andy Mackay and Phil Manzanera of Roxy Music.
Mr. Takahashi wrote much of the music played by Yellow Magic Orchestra; he also played drums and sang lead vocals, though many of their songs were instrumentals.
His voice was rich and louche, strikingly similar to that of Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music, especially on early hits like "Drip Dry Eyes" (1984). He sported a pencil mustache and, in later years, a fedora and thick-rimmed eyeglasses. Like Mr. Ferry, he came across as effortlessly cool and ever-so-slightly world-weary, a hipster who believed in better days to come.
"We had hope for the future, unlike now," Mr. Takahashi said in a 2009 interview, seated between Mr. Sakamoto and Mr. Hosono. "We used to say we will make music that'll be a bridge to the future."
Yukihiro Takahashi was born on June 6, 1952, in Tokyo. He began his music career early, playing drums with college bands while still in junior high school and starting as a session musician at 16.
He is survived by his wife, Kiyomi Takahashi; his brother, Nobuyuki Takahashi, a music producer; and his sister, Mie Ito.
He studied design at Musashino Art University in Tokyo, but did not graduate. During the 1970s, he developed his own clothing line, Bricks; he often designed the outfits worn by Yellow Magic Orchestra, including a striking trio of bright red Mao suits.
Yellow Magic Orchestra broke up in 1984, its members citing musical differences. All three went on to successful solo careers -- Mr. Sakamoto won an Academy Award for his soundtrack to Bernardo Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor" (1987) -- but they remained close, and occasionally reunited. They released an album in 1993, "Technodon," and appeared at a 2012 benefit concert to oppose nuclear power.
"We followed a rock band path, so we stopped" playing as Yellow Magic Orchestra, Mr. Takahashi said in 2009. "But on second thought," he added, nodding toward his bandmates on either side of him, "I couldn't think of anybody I respect more."

A Law Show That's Not in the Usual Order: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An inversion of the usual whodunit, a new crime-of-the-week drama from the producers of "Homeland" and "24" puts ordinary people in extraordinary trouble.
TORONTO -- The actor Michael Chiklis was waxing philosophical on a rainy day last April in North York, a bland but moneyed inner suburb being filmed to pass for an equally bland American counterpart. He was here on location for Fox's new anthology series "Accused," debuting on Sunday, each episode of which dramatizes a hot-button issue from the perspective of an ordinary person on trial.
The past few years, as it happens, had provided plenty of issues to draw from -- school shootings, environmental destruction and racial injustice are just a few the "Accused" writers chose. Those years had also wrought significant personal changes for Chiklis, including the death of his own father. In his profession, as in life, he noted, it was best to be humble in the face of change.
"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing," he said, quoting Socrates from inside a Canadian McMansion. The more he learns, he added, the more he has "come to know the vast chasms of what I don't know."
It was a useful attitude when approaching his character in the series pilot: a caring father and successful neurosurgeon who faces what, for most people, would be an unimaginable moral choice about his teenage son's violent behavior. Although his quandary is uncommon, the father is typical of the protagonists in "Accused," none of whom are career criminals (no prior convictions, no gang affiliations), all of whom find themselves on the wrong end of the law without a road map.
That focus on the accused instead of the cops, on ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, is a novel one for the show's developer, Howard Gordon, who was the showrunner of the breakneck Fox thriller "24" and a developer of the Showtime spy series "Homeland." (Jack Bauer and Carrie Mathison these characters are not.) So is the shift to crime-of-the-week storytelling, which Gordon saw as an opportunity.
"It is really a Trojan horse for these very human stories," Gordon said in the house's basement screening room, while upstairs Chiklis got back to work. "The trick of the show," Gordon added, was to create improbable situations that leave the audience asking: "'What would I have done? How do I feel about this person?' Their guilt or innocence will be almost beside the point."
Chiklis offered an actor's perspective: "It's great to play someone who's just a person in an impossible situation," he said. "Conceptually, this anthology is just fertile ground."
Countless crime dramas begin with the discovery of a body, then work their way up to the "j'accuse" moment. Not so with "Accused," which was adapted from an award-winning British series of the same name, created by Jimmy McGovern for the BBC. (Olivia Colman won a best supporting actress award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2013 for her work in Season 2.)
In the Fox series, as in the British original, "accused" is a past-tense verb; the first thing we see of Chiklis's character, for example, is his arrival at court. Each episode reveals who the characters are and what they are said to have committed gradually, a reversal of the standard whodunit. Call it a whodunwhat.
Gordon had watched the BBC series and was struck by its structure, deciding to pursue a version for American television partly as a means to grapple with contemporary issues that seemed exacerbated -- or just better exposed -- by the pandemic. When he pitched the adaptation to Sony Pictures Television, with whom he and his longtime producing partner Alex Gansa have an overall deal, Gordon described it as "an empathy engine." (Gansa is an executive producer of "Accused.")
For Gordon and Gansa, a network procedural felt like a long way from "Homeland," which the producers adapted from an Israeli series. But the show could also, they believed, be a way to get back at some of the questions that animated "Homeland," like "What is America?" Gordon said. "I would say there's a mythology, this version of America that is so far from its reality."
Doing justice to those questions meant building a team that reflected the diversity of its subject. "Race, gender, power and capitalism are the big tickets that I am wrestling with as a white dude working in a parochial business," Gordon said.
As such, he wanted to give much of the directing and writing work to nonwhite non-dudes. Billy Porter ("Pose"), a gay Black man, directs an episode centered on a drag queen. The writer and director Tazbah Chavez ("Reservation Dogs," "Rutherford Falls"), who is Nüümü, Diné and San Carlos Apache, directs and co-wrote an episode about Indigenous environmental protesters. And the Oscar-winning actor Marlee Matlin ("CODA"), who is deaf, makes her directing debut with an episode about a deaf surrogate mother (played by Stephanie Nogueras).
On a recent video call, Matlin said she gave a "quick yes" after reading the script for the episode she directed, "Ava's Story." She said she had never before seen a story perspective like that on‌screen.
"The deaf lens was missing in stories that feature deaf actors or characters," she said through an interpreter. "I was offered this opportunity out of the blue, and I kind of froze like a deer in the headlights."
Once she was on set, Matlin first said "action" quietly to herself, she recalled. "The first A.D. said, 'You're going to have to say that louder,"' she said. "I was a little bit giddy about having to yell out that word."
Several of the characters in "Ava's Story" are deaf, and there was a freedom in being able to communicate with the deaf actors who played them in American Sign Language, Matlin said.
"There was 110‌ percent no barriers," Matlin said. "I can talk to them across the room, we can understand each other because we communicated in our language."
Wrangling the schedules of name directors and a constantly shifting cast -- other top actors include Abigail Breslin, Malcolm Jamal-Warner, Margo Martindale and Wendell Pierce -- was difficult, Gordon said ("It's like casting a movie every single time"), but he hoped the big names would help lure viewers.
The extra effort also seemed to help create an inclusive atmosphere on set. At a taping in August on a Toronto soundstage, Chavez directed an episode that centers on Indigenous-led protests against uranium mining. Despite the serious subject of the episode, Chavez was at ease, ensuring the set was enjoyable -- at one point she blasted Shania Twain songs from her phone as the actor Jennifer Podemski, who is of Anishinaabe and Jewish descent, danced beside her in a bailiff costume -- and that everyone's time was being used efficiently.
"I just don't believe in putting people through more trauma," Chavez said from her trailer. She was also in her element.
"I come from a protest family," she said. ‌"My spring breaks as a kid were spent protesting, like, Yucca Mountain nuclear waste locations."
True to that sprit, her episode, which is set among the Navajo people, challenges the concept of the U.S. legal system being the only form of justice on North American soil. It presents tribal jurisdiction as a more culturally compatible form of law enforcement on tribal lands, a perspective not often seen onscreen, Chavez noted.
"I think the theme of the show is brilliant‌," said the actor Robert I. Mesa, who is Navajo and Soboba, on break from an intense interrogation scene. "It shows what we go through as Native people in the justice system, and how we're tried."
Of course, no set is an island, perhaps especially with a show inspired by difficult current events. Speaking by video in late August, the actor Aisha Dee described the experience of shooting her episode, which focuses on a white nationalist who drives his car into a peaceful demonstration. The script had no shortage of similar real-world examples to draw from when it was written. Still, the world provided one more when a white gunman killed 10 Black people in a racist attack at a Buffalo supermarket.
"I think it was the day after the shooting in Buffalo, and we were filming this episode that really centered around white nationalism, race and how it's showing its face in America," Dee said. Filming was emotionally harrowing. She cautiously hoped, though, that by confronting such issues head on, the series might have an impact.
"Not that I think an episode of television can change structures and systems that have been in place for hundreds of years," she said. "But if watching the episode can make someone feel a little bit less alone, I hope it teaches and comforts in a weird kind of messed up way."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This thriller, about a teenage girl whose mother disappears, plays out on a computer screen.
The gimmick behind "Missing," a strenuous techno-thriller about a teen girl named June (Storm Reid) who takes to the internet to track down her mother (Nia Long), is that the directors and screenwriters, Will Merrick and Nick Johnson, frame the action on computer screens. All of June's sleuthing is cloistered to apps which she opens in increasing panic. She's a web-weaned child who barely bothered to speak to her mom even before the parent's disappearance. Initially, June celebrates having the house to herself by Googling "How to throw a rager." Her friends dutifully post her drunkenness to Instagram so that we, the viewer, can witness it.
June's mother was last seen headed to Cartagena with her boyfriend (Ken Leung), a dork so drab that even his festive vacation shirts are drained of color. By the end of the first act, June and her best friend (Megan Suri) are scouring the man's Facebook for clues to hack his email password. (Maybe they should try RedH3rring $ .)
From there, the story emboldens itself from relatable online stalking to ludicrous plot twists, both of which Reid parries with confidence. When the film momentarily feigns to look like a film, the image zooms out to reveal that the handsome cinematography is really a true crime docuseries streaming on June's laptop. (In a meta-joke, the show is a glossy re-enactment of the producers' previous film, the 2018 mystery "Searching," which shared a near-identical premise.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Missing" captures the constant distractions of the modern age. Pop-up windows continually tug at June's attention. However, the film's more engaging moments tap into the older cyber nostalgia of text-based adventure games from the 1970s, where problems are solved by typing the right command: Enter cave. Brandish sword. Write "Can I see the security camera?" into on online English-Spanish translator while on the phone with your mother's hotel. It's not exactly riveting to watch June download and install WhatsApp so that she can video call Colombia. Yet, there's some pleasure in a brains-over-brawn quest that flatters us to fancy that we might be clever enough to solve it ourselves, despite giggles that arise when Julian Scherle's score swells so portentously for June's digital breakthroughs that you'd think Conan had smote an army. Even goofier is an emotional scene that builds to June pledging this teary promise to her vanished mother: "I'll stop making fun of you for using Siri for everything."
When June's quest goes viral, the investigation -- along with her role in her own narrative -- nearly slips out of her grasp. Too much connectivity can be a cancer, Merrick and Johnson seem to say, and most of us already agree. Yet, there's an oddly emotional sequence when June breaks into her mother's dating app and, for the first time, learns to see her as a woman with her own desires. Better still is a bit part by the actor Joaquim de Almeida as Javier, a gig worker in Cartagena -- "cleaning, electricity, you know" -- who June hires to do cheap on-location reconnaissance. Javier has only a two-and-a-half star rating, but he's so good that I spent the film hoping June would take a minute to write him a glowing review.

Full text: Like so many anxious filmmakers the week before the start of the Sundance Film Festival, Erica Tremblay was tucked inside a dark room in Los Angeles, prepping the final sound mix for her feature debut, "Fancy Dance."
Ms. Tremblay has one of those quintessential Sundance tales: abandoning her career in publishing at age 40 to pursue filmmaking, specifically to tell stories centered in her Seneca-Cayuga Nation in Oklahoma. Her first short film, "Little Chief," premiered at Sundance in 2020. Her script for "Fancy Dance" was accepted into the 2021 Sundance Lab, and with the help of the Sundance Institute, she secured financing to make the movie. Production concluded in September, and just three months later, "Fancy Dance" was chosen out of more than 4,000 feature film submissions to be shown at this year's festival, which begins Thursday.
None of it would have happened without her financiers. One, Nina Yang Bongiovi of Significant Productions, has been financing indie films like "Fruitvale Station" and "Passing" since 2013. Another, Tommy Oliver, the founder and chief executive of Confluential Films, is relatively new to the finance game after spending the past decade producing and directing his own films.
"The thing that I like the best about working with Tommy is that I had creative autonomy," said Ms. Tremblay, who has been working in one of Mr. Oliver's bungalows on his Confluential campus since Thanksgiving. "Even though it's hard to trust first-time filmmakers, whatever he saw in this, he was like, let's do it. He has been there for the project but also been there for me as a creator. He was somewhat of a resident therapist in that regard."
Mr. Oliver is one of a number of financiers of color with films making their debut at the festival whose mission is to elevate underrepresented voices with financial investments. They also include Charles King, Luis A. Miranda Jr., Kimberly Steward, Doug Choi and Ms. Yang Bongiovi.
It's a far cry from how things used to be and a sign that diversity efforts have moved from the periphery of the business more toward its center.
"When I started in the business, in the '80s, I was so used to being not only the only Asian American but the only minority at the table ever," said Chris Lee, a former president of production at Sony's TriStar Pictures. He is executive-producing the Justin Chon film "Jamojaya," which received financing from Starlight Media, a Los Angeles-based Chinese financier that backed "Crazy Rich Asians."
"Now, you want an A-list director, you can go to John Chu, you can go to Destin Daniel Cretton, you can go to Justin Lin," Mr. Lee added. "There's so many choices to put people in front of the camera now that people didn't think of before."
Still, just appearing at Sundance is not the endgame. The true standard for success for these financiers will be how these movies perform at the festival and if distributors buy them. Alexis Garcia, who leads the film group at the independent studio Fifth Season, previously known as Endeavor Content, said distributors had told him that the festival's lineup of films this year didn't look commercial and that it could be a soft year for acquisitions.
Should that be the case, that could be a setback for the financiers who are just getting started.
"When you are working with directors who are from an underrepresented group, there is actually more at risk, because if it doesn't work, it just perpetuates the mythology," said Kevin Iwashina, Fifth Season's senior vice president of documentaries, who helped finance the Sundance doc "Going Varsity in Mariachi" and fully financed "AUM: The Cult at the End of the World," a documentary about the cult responsible for the 1995 sarin gas subway attack in Tokyo. "And so decisions become that much more precise. There is more at risk than just financial capital."
Mr. Oliver is staking a lot in the four films he has headed to Sundance, in something of a coming-out party for Confluential Films. Mr. Oliver began the operation in 2013 as a label for his own productions -- he is also a writer and director -- but has recently expanded his ambitions. He hired Charlotte Koh, formerly of Searchlight Pictures, as Confluential's president in 2021 and has dedicated the company to financing projects by creators of color. Goldman Sachs helped raise $ 100 million to $ 150 million that Confluential will use for operating and production costs.
Best known for creating the popular OWN series "Black Love" with his wife, Codie Elaine Oliver -- the two own the show and all its ancillary products: podcasts, live events and merchandising -- Mr. Oliver has ambitions that run from indie films to prestige pictures to helping finance studio movies.
In addition to "Fancy Dance," the producer has invested in "Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project," a documentary about Ms. Giovanni, the American poet, and the narrative features "Young. Wild. Free." and "To Live and Die and Live." The upcoming Netflix movie "The Perfect Find," starring Gabrielle Union, is also being produced by Confluential after the company optioned the novel by Tia Williams.
"We have the ability to say yes, and not just say yes, but to look at what the makeup of those projects are, and that's significant," Mr. Oliver said. "What I'm really excited about building is something that is sustainable to support, not just one director but a bunch of directors. We can do something now where we have a different type of seat at the table."
Mr. Miranda is using the money he made from the theatrical hit "Hamilton" -- created by his son, Lin-Manuel Miranda -- to invest in young artists, many of them from underrepresented groups and communities. After receiving an unsolicited email from the producer James Lawler, Mr. Miranda invested in the Sundance documentary "Going Varsity in Mariachi," which depicts high school Mariachi contests popular in the border towns in Texas. It's one of the better-known documentaries scheduled to debut in competition.
To Mr. Miranda, a veteran political strategist, the film was the perfect combination of storytelling and politics and showed where he wants to put his money.
"We are a huge part of the audience of movies but not a large number of the ones that are financing films," he said in an interview, referring to his Latino roots. "And I know that there are a lot of voices out there who have not been able to tell their stories. I know that because my son was one of them. If I would have had the money then, Lin-Manuel would not have had to go through three years of rewriting and knocking on doors. So if I can make young, talented people's lives easier in telling their stories, I will do that."
Ms. Yang Bongiovi said finding financing for films featuring people of color remained challenging. She recalled her experience with "Passing," from the writer and director Rebecca Hall, starring Tessa Thompson ("Thor: Ragnarok") and Ruth Negga ("Loving"). The film was bought by Netflix for a healthy sum out of Sundance in 2021 and was lauded by critics. Yet getting it made was "practically impossible," she said, "and that was not that long ago."
"I was told, 'You have two women of color starring in it -- that's challenging,"' Ms. Yang Bongiovi said. "And then I remember telling folks: 'Tessa Thompson is a Marvel superhero. She's Valkyrie!' But it just didn't equate. It was a reminder that we still have a long way to go."
The growing number of financiers like her from underrepresented groups has Ms. Yang Bongiovi feeling hopeful. It means that instead of competing for projects, they can work together, reduce their individual risk and contribute the money needed to make these films.
"Because there are more multicultural financiers and producers, we are teaming up," she said. "We don't see each other as competitors. We're like: 'Hey, we're allies. We got to go in together, to force the tide to come through for us."'
Ms. Yang Bongiovi and Mr. Oliver worked together on "Fancy Dance," while Mr. King and Mr. Oliver both backed "Young. Wild. Free.," a film directed by Thembi L. Banks about a high school student whose life turns when he is robbed by the girl of his dreams. Mr. Oliver and Ms. Yang Bongiovi are also supporting "To Live and Die and Live," from the director Qasim Basir.
"To me, that's where you see real change, how we have found ways to partner and come together to move entire ecosystems," said Mr. King, founder and chief executive of Macro, an eight-year-old company that has helped finance films like "Judas and the Black Messiah" with Warner Bros. and "Sorry to Bother You" with Ms. Yang Bongiovi. The latter was sold to Annapurna Pictures out of Sundance in 2018.
"When I launched Macro, it was with a vision for building a multibillion-dollar media company that is going to have global impact, but also economically empower our communities and help to shape culture," he said. "That companies like Confluential and others who've raised capital, who are financing, that they're doing it as well, and then to be able to do things together, that's fantastic. That's only creating more opportunities for all of us."

The Meltdown Wasn't BAD For Crypto. It Was GOOD.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Despite trillions of dollars of losses, a batch of bankruptcies and one very high profile arrest, blockchain's devotees remain devoted.
On the wall in Ruar Street Food, a burger joint in the Sant Antoni neighborhood of Barcelona, there is a framed drawing of a male hand holding up a middle finger, high and proud, The image captures the defiant mood at a gathering of a couple dozen men and women in their 20s and 30s, all employed in various corners of the cryptocurrency world.
This industry has plenty of naysayers. But as far as everyone here tonight is concerned, those people can talk to the hand.
Which, given the onslaught of terrible news, goes beyond defiance and tip toes into the ZIP code of magical thinking. With spectacular losses ( $ 2 trillion in crypto assets, poof!), gruesome bankruptcies (Terra, Luna, Celsius) and fraud charges against the sector's highest-profile entrepreneur (Sam Bankman-Fried, of the now-kaput FTX exchange), few industries were more brutalized in 2022.
The carnage was not merely financial; the reputation and promise of crypto has been badly tarnished. Once touted as the future of money, a challenge to the world's central banks, not to mention a clever investment, crypto now carries the odor of disaster. The notion that it could serve as a hedge against inflation took a beating when Bitcoin fell more than 60 percent. Thousands of other tokens sank even lower or effectively vanished.
Despite this, attendees at the Ruar Street meet-up, organized by a crypto community called Web3 Family, are buoyant and ready for whatever 2023 has to offer. Beer flows, crypto-themed T-shirts are raffled off, fries with creamy cheddar and bacon are consumed. There are no hints of anxiety.
It's clear before the second round lands that the crypto faithful are keeping the faith.
The flock includes Maria Rebelo, a 27-year-old who works for a Canadian company called Ureeqa that helps artists monetize NFTs, a.k.a. nonfungible tokens. These are digital assets -- photos, music, sports memorabilia, whatever -- that are recorded and tracked by blockchain, the virtual ledger that enables all things crypto. She rhapsodized about how blockchain could lead to "a worldwide community, instead of one government per country."
"When we open up the decentralized world, we offer ways for humans to collaborate in ways they never have before," she said. "That's human development."
Interviews in Barcelona and with executives around the world suggest that a year's worth of fiascos has done little to diminish the enthusiasm of true believers. Many liken this moment to the dot-com crash of 2001, a calamity that wiped out even more wealth -- an estimated $ 5 trillion -- and ultimately yielded some blue-chip companies. ("Amazon was down 90 percent at one point" is a line uttered time and again.)
A variation of that sentiment was offered by Joe Hernandez, who handles fraud detection for a company called Gitcoin, a platform that promises on its website to "build and fund open web together." He was taking a smoke break on the sidewalk outside of Ruar, wearing a purple-and-white varsity jacket, its back emblazoned with the image of an astronaut playing an arcade game.
He is an American, who happened to be visiting Barcelona. Other digital nomads have settled here, drawn by the city's beauty and relative affordability and hailing from China, Argentina, Portugal, France, Ukraine and elsewhere.
Many say that crypto is shouldering the blame for the bad actors that it attracts. Swindlers are going to swindle.
"Every cycle, a bunch of fraudsters come along and a bunch of tokens go to zero," Mr. Hernandez said. "Galling is a pretty good word for it. Because it scares a lot of people away."
Some of the crypto faithful see an upside to the wipeout of 2022. To them it was like a four-keg frat party that the cops busted. Those still standing are proud to say that they weren't distracted by the revelry.
"Now more than ever we're encouraged that we are doing the right thing by just believing in the fundamentals of crypto," said Elion Chin, the co-creator of Nimiq, an open-source payment system that allows users to hold and spend crypto right from their web browsers. Like thousands of ventures, Nimiq has also issued a coin, which is down 92 percent from its high in 2021.
Yet none of its 27 "full-time contributors" have left.
"Money is very important, but that's not necessarily the full and only reward our contributors are getting here," Mr. Chin said on a phone call from Costa Rica. "They're working with people they enjoy working with, on something they believe can make a difference."
This is a common refrain. While crypto has been associated with quick riches, good luck finding people who will say they are sticking it out for a payday. Instead, there's a lot of earnest talk about the ways that blockchain will transform the world -- helping to solve climate change, streamlining supply chains, even reshaping work in a way that lets more people find jobs they enjoy. (Because the blockchain can handle all sorts of drudgery.)
There is also lot of talk about agitating to free incarcerated heroes of the cyber world. The crypto catechism has an anti-government, libertarian streak that quickly surfaces over cocktails. Among the giveaways tonight is a T-shirt reading "Free Alex Pertsev," who is in jail in the Netherlands, facing charges of money laundering. He is the developer of Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury.
In this crowd only banks are held in greater suspicion than governments. If you think of your bank as nothing more than a dull place to stash money, you have probably never spent much time with crypto evangelists. These institutions stand accused of profiteering, money laundering and keeping tabs on how people spend, which is just the kind of information the government is already collecting -- in order to track your carbon footprint.
That, at least, is the hunch of a young Italian at the Ruar meet-up, a guy in a smart blue sweater who could pass for a first-year management consultant. He did not want his name in this story, part of a broader ethos of remaining as invisible as possible. He described a future in which governments fine citizens for contributing to climate change, and said there's no better way to keep tabs on that than through what those citizens spend, something only banks know.
For years, there's been talk about the separation of church and state, he explained. Crypto will hasten the separation of money and state.
While crypto's supporters focus on wildly ambitious goals in an imagined future, critics point to debacles that happen all the time. Like the theft of $ 3 billion worth of crypto last year, as estimated by Chainanalysis. Then there is the discomfiting reality that crypto streamlines life for criminals -- human traffickers, drug dealers, ransomware extractors, mobsters and the government of North Korea, which employs hackers who steal crypto all day, every day.
"Terrible things happen in crypto pretty regularly and yet the crypto faithful are very good at separating them from their perceived ideal of crypto," said Molly White, who runs Web3 Is Going Just Great, a website that chronicles crypto's tribulations. "If something goes poorly, it's always some other factor, like poor implementation. Which makes it easy to hold on to your ideological position."
As Ms. White notes, crypto has been around since 2009 and has yet to produce a single product or service that ordinary people use in their daily lives. Just wait, counter the crypto faithful, who contend an epochal breakthrough is around the corner. It's like a cult leader who has predicted the end of the world on a certain day. When the apocalypse fails to materialize, core tenets are not abandoned. Instead, a new date is named.
That said, crypto's highly public battering has forced companies to re-evaluate their strategies. There was a time when businesses that weren't even in the tech sphere reached for crypto magic by adding "blockchain" to their name, which often goosed their stock price. Most famously, the Long Island Iced Tea Corporation became the Long Blockchain Corporation, and its stock rose nearly 300 percent in a day.
Now, the opposite is happening -- companies squarely in the crypto sphere are shedding the "b" word. In early January, a Bitcoin mining company, Riot Blockchain, became Riot Platforms. In October, Applied Blockchain became Applied Digital. ("We're broadening our scope," an executive said in an interview with the Street.) A lot of venture capital firms that once chased crypto projects now will not return calls.
Reinventions are underway. Ziliqa, which long pitched itself as a blockchain platform, is barreling into the world of online games. In October, it launched Web3War, a first-person shooter, and another eight or nine titles are in the works. Game-related commerce will be handled on the blockchain. But ideally, said Matt Ryan, the chief executive, gamers will not notice.
"They don't need to see the blockchain; they just need to know that it works," he said in a video interview from his home in London.
Calling this venture quixotic doesn't capture it. Gaming is a mature and crowded market, led by blue-chip corporations, like Sony and Microsoft, and dominated by titans like PUBG: Battlegrounds, which has been downloaded more than one billion times.
And Web3War? To date, about 5,500 people have signed up. Mr. Ryan is undaunted.
"I think if we get to 10,000, watch this space," he said. "It proves we've got a product that people want."
Mr. Ryan is a born optimist, he acknowledges, and that is true for most of the crypto faithful. This entails not just predicting a great future for blockchain, but ignoring its failures.
In November, the Australian Securities Exchange canceled plans for a blockchain-based system for clearing trades, incurring a $ 168 million charge. In November, the Danish shipping company Maersk unplugged its blockchain platform. In a statement, it said, "the need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved."
These failures do not surprise Lee Reiners, policy director at the Duke Financial Economics Center. Blockchain is essentially a database software, he notes, and not a very popular one. It would never have achieved its devoted following, or attracted billions in venture capital funding, without its connection to crypto. And that, he says, is a tragedy no one has fully reckoned with.
"Imagine if all the money and talent flooding into crypto over the last ten years had gone into combating climate change or cancer research," Professor Reiners said. "It's a tremendous misuse of societal resources, and it's all because people wanted to make money fast. Despite what they're saying, what attracted most folks was the perceived opportunity to get rich quick."
The talent that Professor Reiners thinks has been misallocated begs to differ. The meet-up at Ruar ended late, with a small group discussing how the pandemic proved that governments could easily control their populations, and the ways that banks chipped in. One attendee mentioned that the account of a customer had been closed for refusing to wear a mask during a visit to a bank. If all goes as planned, that customer will someday have other options.
"From where I'm standing, there's an opportunity to tell the world that there's a paradigm-changing positive future that blockchain enables," said Mr. Hernandez of Gitcoin. "But that's not the story right now."

Full text: Ticket sales totaled $ 15 million over the holiday weekend, fueled by older audiences in the middle of the country.
A nearly extinct species of theatrical movie -- a conventional drama aimed at older ticket buyers in the middle of the country -- sent a reminder to Hollywood over the weekend: If you build it (properly), they will come.
"A Man Called Otto," starring Tom Hanks as a cranky widower, will collect roughly $ 15 million over the four-day holiday weekend in the United States, for a total of $ 21 million since opening in limited release on Dec. 20, according to Comscore. That kind of sturdy debut has recently escaped pedigreed dramas like "Babylon," "She Said," "Amsterdam," "Till" and "The Fabelmans," leading to worries about the viability of dramas in theaters.
For the most part, these films have been aimed at audiences on the coasts. "A Man Called Otto," however, was marketed toward heartland audiences. Crowds came out in places like Detroit, Minneapolis, Denver and Salt Lake City, box office analysts said. None of the top 75 theaters for the film were located in Los Angeles or New York, which is very unusual.
Ticket sales were "particularly vibrant in small-town theaters," according to Sony Pictures Entertainment, which released the PG-13 film. About 60 percent of ticket buyers were female, and 46 percent of attendees were over the age of 55, Sony said. "A Man Called Otto" received warm reviews (68 percent positive, according to Rotten Tomatoes), with the obviousness of the plot the primary complaint. But ticket buyers loved it, as evidenced by a 96 percent positive audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
"The audience for original adult films will absolutely return to theaters, if we don't forget them," Tom Rothman, the chairman of the Sony Motion Picture Group, said in an email. "And if you are able to strike a chord in Middle America, it can be especially strong." "A Man Called Otto" took in 50 percent more than the $ 10 million that analysts predicted going into the weekend.
"A Man Called Otto" cost about $ 50 million to make (not including marketing expenses), with financing shared by TSG Entertainment and SF Studios, a Swedish film and television company. A remake of a Swedish film and based on a best-selling novel called "A Man Called Ove," it is the heartstring-tugging story of a depressed widower who finds himself in an unusual friendship with a new neighbor. Hanks co-stars with Mariana Treviño and a cat named Smeagol. The movie was directed by Marc Forster, who is known for "Finding Neverland" and "Quantum of Solace."
The top movies at the North American box office over the weekend were wide-release holdovers. In first place, "Avatar: The Way of Water" (Disney) collected about $ 38.5 million between Friday and Monday, for a five-week total of $ 563 million ( $ 1.9 billion worldwide). "M3gan," a horror comedy from Universal, ranked second, with estimated ticket sales of $ 21.2 million, for a two-week total of $ 60 million ( $ 91 million worldwide).

Crypto Meltdown, What Crypto Meltdown?

BARCELONA — On the wall in Ruar Street Food, a burger joint in the Sant Antoni neighborhood of Barcelona, there is a framed drawing of a male hand holding up a middle finger, high and proud. The image captures the defiant mood at a gathering of a couple of dozen men and women in their 20s and 30s, all employed in various corners of the cryptocurrency world.
This industry has plenty of naysayers. But as far as everyone here tonight is concerned, those people can talk to the hand.
Which, given the onslaught of terrible news, goes beyond defiance and tiptoes into the ZIP code of magical thinking. With spectacular losses ($2 trillion in crypto assets, poof!), gruesome bankruptcies (Terra, Luna, Celsius) and fraud charges against the sector’s highest-profile entrepreneur (Sam Bankman-Fried, of the now-kaput FTX exchange), few industries were more brutalized in 2022.
The carnage was not merely financial; the reputation and promise of crypto has been badly tarnished. Once touted as the future of money, a challenge to the world’s central banks, not to mention a clever investment, crypto now carries the odor of disaster. The notion that it could serve as a hedge against inflation took a beating when bitcoin fell more than 60%. Thousands of other tokens sank even lower or effectively vanished.
Despite this, attendees at the Ruar Street meet-up, organized by a crypto community called Web3 Family, are buoyant and ready for whatever 2023 has to offer. Beer flows, crypto-themed T-shirts are raffled off, fries with creamy cheddar and bacon are consumed. There are no hints of anxiety.
It’s clear before the second round lands that the crypto faithful are keeping the faith.
The flock includes Maria Rebelo, a 27-year-old who works for a Canadian company called Ureeqa that helps artists monetize NFTs, aka nonfungible tokens. These are digital assets — photos, music, sports memorabilia, whatever — that are recorded and tracked by blockchain, the virtual ledger that enables all things crypto. She rhapsodized about how blockchain could lead to “a worldwide community, instead of one government per country.”
“When we open up the decentralized world, we offer ways for humans to collaborate in ways they never have before,” she said. “That’s human development.”
Interviews in Barcelona and with executives around the world suggest that a year’s worth of fiascos has done little to diminish the enthusiasm of true believers. Many liken this moment to the dot-com crash of 2001, a calamity that wiped out even more wealth — an estimated $5 trillion — and ultimately yielded some blue-chip companies. (“Amazon was down 90% at one point” is a line uttered time and again.)
A variation of that sentiment was offered by Joe Hernandez, who handles fraud detection for a company called Gitcoin, a platform that promises on its website to “build and fund open web together.” He was taking a smoke break on the sidewalk outside of Ruar, wearing a purple-and-white varsity jacket, its back emblazoned with the image of an astronaut playing an arcade game.
He is an American, who happened to be visiting Barcelona. Other digital nomads have settled here, drawn by the city’s beauty and relative affordability and hailing from China, Argentina, Portugal, France, Ukraine and elsewhere.
Many say that crypto is shouldering the blame for the bad actors that it attracts. Swindlers are going to swindle.
“Every cycle, a bunch of fraudsters come along and a bunch of tokens go to zero,” Hernandez said. “Galling is a pretty good word for it. Because it scares a lot of people away.”
Some of the crypto faithful see an upside to the wipeout of 2022. To them it was like a four-keg frat party that the cops busted. Those still standing are proud to say that they weren’t distracted by the revelry.
“Now more than ever we’re encouraged that we are doing the right thing by just believing in the fundamentals of crypto,” said Elion Chin, co-creator of Nimiq, an open-source payment system that allows users to hold and spend crypto right from their web browsers. Like thousands of ventures, Nimiq has also issued a coin, which is down 92% from its high in 2021.
Yet none of its 27 “full-time contributors” have left.
“Money is very important, but that’s not necessarily the full and only reward our contributors are getting here,” Chin said on a phone call from Costa Rica. “They’re working with people they enjoy working with, on something they believe can make a difference.”
This is a common refrain. While crypto has been associated with quick riches, good luck finding people who will say they are sticking it out for a payday. Instead, there’s a lot of earnest talk about the ways that blockchain will transform the world — helping to solve climate change, streamlining supply chains, even reshaping work in a way that lets more people find jobs they enjoy. (Because the blockchain can handle all sorts of drudgery.)
There is also lot of talk about agitating to free incarcerated heroes of the cyber world. The crypto catechism has an anti-government, libertarian streak that quickly surfaces over cocktails. Among the giveaways tonight is a T-shirt reading “Free Alex Pertsev,” who is in jail in the Netherlands, facing charges of money laundering. He is the developer of Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury.
In this crowd only banks are held in greater suspicion than governments. If you think of your bank as nothing more than a dull place to stash money, you have probably never spent much time with crypto evangelists.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: HBO's new post-apocalyptic series is based on a video game with tens of millions of fans. For them and for newcomers, here's what to expect.
The pop culture landscape is littered with bad adaptations of hit video games, from the notoriously awful 1993 film "Super Mario Bros." to the recently canceled series "Resident Evil," on Netflix. HBO hopes to buck that trend with its first, "The Last of Us," based on the wildly popular video game series about the survivors of a devastating pandemic. After years of being stuck in development purgatory as a potential movie, the adaptation has evolved into one of this winter's most hotly anticipated shows, starring Pedro Pascal ("The Mandalorian") and Bella Ramsey ("Game of Thrones").
Premiering on Sunday, the nine-episode first season largely follows the outline of the first PlayStation game, from 2013, which to date has sold over 20 million copies. New to the franchise? Here's what to know about the series before it debuts.
Hollywood purgatory
Developed by the video game company Naughty Dog, "The Last of Us" is a deeply cinematic game set after the collapse of civilization, caused by a parasitic fungus that turns people into brain-dead, flesh-ripping monsters. The game was an instant success -- a divisive 2020 sequel likewise sold millions -- and it was targeted for adaptation almost immediately.
In 2014, the production studio Screen Gems announced that it would be distributing a Sam Raimi-produced film version of the game, with Kaitlyn Dever and the "Game of Thrones" star Maisie Williams as early contenders to play the female lead. In 2016, the project stalled over creative disagreements about the tone of the film, with one of the lead developers of the game, Neil Druckmann, saying that he had wanted a movie resembling "No Country for Old Men" while the studio wanted "World War Z."
Then in March 2020, HBO announced it would be producing a series created by Druckmann and Craig Mazin, the creator of HBO's Emmy-winning "Chernobyl." Part zombie flick, part road picture, the result (based on an advance screening of the first nine episodes) is a bleak, post-apocalyptic television drama with echoes of "Children of Men," "The Road" and "The Walking Dead."
A frightening future, today
The bulk of Season 1 takes place in 2023, two decades after a heartbreaking prologue in which Joel (Pascal), a construction contractor and single father from Austin, sees his life fall apart and the pandemic take hold. By our present year, the world has been torn apart not only by the vicious creatures who were once human but also by a brutal military dictatorship. For everyone else, it's often kill or be killed.
In this dystopian future, where Boston has become a walled city, Joel meets a switchblade-wielding teenage girl named Ellie (Ramsey), who is being held captive by a rebel group known as the Fireflies. The Fireflies have discovered that Ellie is immune to the fungus and may, therefore, hold the key to humanity's survival. When Joel's brother, Tommy (Gabriel Luna), goes missing, Joel, who in this new world has become an intrepid smuggler, agrees to smuggle Ellie outside the walls. In exchange, the Fireflies give him the supplies he needs to search for his brother. Things go quickly wrong, and the cross-country journey begins.
Familiar faces (and sounds)
Most of the supporting characters in the HBO version of "The Last of Us" will be familiar to players of the game, including Joel's smuggling partner (and seeming romantic partner), Tess (Anna Torv), and the Fireflies leader Marlene (Merle Dandridge, who also voiced the character in the game). Fans of the game series will also recognize the brothers Henry (Lamar Johnson) and Sam (Keivonn Woodard); Ellie's former ally Riley (Storm Reid); and the malevolent David (Scott Shepherd), a cult leader with dark secrets of his own.
A few major characters, however, won't be so recognizable. Nick Offerman plays the familiar smuggler Bill, but his role in the series is very different. Another character named Frank, who is only a dead body in the game, is brought to life by Murray Bartlett in the series. A vicious revolutionary named Kathleen, played by Melanie Lynskey, is entirely new.
Mazin and Druckmann also found small onscreen roles for the game's main voice actors, including Troy Baker (who voices Joel in the game), Ashley Johnson (who voices Ellie) and Jeffrey Pierce (Tommy). Even the game's original composer, Gustavo Santaolalla, returns to do the TV score.
A faithful adaptation
The big question for fans of the video game is, how faithful will the series be to its source material? Early signs suggest the answer is "very," with the show including most of the major characters and plot points. It even incorporates material from the excellent expansion prequel to the game titled "Left Behind."
Without the action-first requirements of a video game, Druckmann and Mazin seem freed to deepen the dominant themes. As a result, the show tells an even more character-driven, grounded story about a broken man who is stuck in the past and the traumatized girl who forces him to rediscover his own humanity, equal partners in a symbiotic hero's journey. Joel has barely scraped by for 20 years when he meets Ellie, but she gives him reason to hope again, even as their road winds through unspeakable violence.
Unlike a lot of child-in-distress characters, Ellie is extremely tough; she grew up in this world, and her arc is as essential as Joel's. The game has been lauded for its diversity of characters in a medium often dominated by macho male protagonists, and that hasn't been lost in translation.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Though his turn in the drama "Living" is the subject of Oscar chatter, just try getting him to talk about his art. He prefers self-deprecation instead.
The British actor Bill Nighy was trying to describe how he prepared for his character in the new drama "Living." He plays Mr. Williams, a buttoned-up, almost catatonically reticent bureaucrat in post-World War II London who, upon learning that he is dying, decides finally to live.
"Anything I say from now on, please treat it with a degree of suspicion or take it with a pinch of salt," Nighy said. He was speaking from a car en route from Los Angeles to Palm Springs, where he was to receive the International Star Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. He was listening to Aretha Franklin's "That's the Way I Feel About 'Cha," from his playlist.
"I never know how to talk about it," he went on, speaking of his profession. "When people talk about the mechanics of acting, I'm wary of it. Not because it's anything fancy or mysterious or complicated or ethereal. It's all practical stuff. Acting is. ..." Here he trailed off. You could hear the humor in his voice, even from 3,000 miles away. "I started a sentence with 'acting is,' and that's a bad sign," he said.
Nighy, who is 73 and who has appeared in more than 70 movies, is a kind of stealth weapon as an actor, in that his performances are exquisitely calibrated and always memorable, though rarely showy. Whether playing a raddled has-been pop star stooping to record a Christmas song in "Love Actually"; or the title character's baroquely hypochondriacal father in the 2020 version of "Emma"; or an aging spy in the BBC movie "Page Eight"; or a widower visiting his much younger ex-lover, played by Carey Mulligan, in the West End and Broadway revival of David Hare's "Skylight"; or even (in a small but vivid part) an art historian speaking lyrically about Vincent Van Gogh in an episode of "Doctor Who," Nighy fully inhabits his characters while remaining very much himself.
He is a beloved figure to audiences, to Londoners who often see him out and about in the city -- one of his favorite things is sitting alone in cafes and reading a book -- and judging by the gushing responses when his name is mentioned, to virtually everyone he has ever worked with.
"He's unfailingly gracious and kind," said the director Richard Curtis, who cast Nighy in "Love Actually" and has worked with him frequently since. "One of the luckiest moments in life is when you find a really fine classic actor who's got all that emotional depth and acting skills and who's also very funny."
"Living" was written specifically with Nighy in mind. It's a remake of Akira Kurosawa's "Ikiru," about a paper-pushing bureaucrat in postwar Japan roused out of his paralyzing inertia in the final months of his life. The novelist and Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro, whose family moved to England from Nagasaki when he was a boy, had long loved the film and recognized the parallels between postwar Japan and postwar Britain -- each struggling to rebuild after the devastations of the war, each full of people straitjacketed by cultural repression and societal expectations -- and the potential for a remake of the film, to be set in 1950s London.
One night in London, Ishiguro and his wife, Lorna MacDougall, were having dinner with the producer Stephen Woolley and Woolley's wife, Elizabeth Karlsen. Nighy arrived late. But it was then that Ishiguro mentioned the idea of a remake -- and said it would be a perfect film for Nighy.
"It's quite easy for actors to perform these stereotypes of the English gent," Ishiguro said in an interview. "But to play that English person and add to it something profoundly, hauntingly human that isn't just English, but universal -- that's something quite special. That's why I thought it had to be Bill Nighy. I couldn't think of anybody else."
Woolley agreed and cajoled Ishiguro into writing the script, even though the author was in the middle of writing "Klara and the Sun" and said he was bad at screenplays and loath to take on anything else. Ishiguro named the main character Mr. Williams as an homage to Nighy's first name.
The dialogue -- at least in the beginning, before Mr. Williams has a quiet but seismic epiphany about how he should live out his now dramatically shortened life -- is spare and stark, full of scenes in which people struggle and fail to express themselves. (Nighy's character receives his terminal cancer diagnosis from a doctor who notes how awkward the conversation is. "Quite," Nighy says, all but blending in with the furniture.)
"Bill has the innate understanding of minimalism when it comes to the cinema," Woolley said. He contrasted the actor's approach with the more operatic, emotive performance of Takashi Shimura, the star of "Ikiru." Nighy "has an amazing way of communicating by doing very little, just a small gesture or a smile. He can absolutely floor you with a raised eyebrow."
Woolley added, "He's just a fantastic actor and a wonderful human being, and you rarely find that in the same person."
But to try to get Nighy to talk about his approach, or his success, or even his career is to run into a charming wall of beguiling misdirection and obfuscatory self-deprecation. Noting that he has been doing many interviews lately, he said: "I'll try to think of things I haven't said before."
Why did Ishiguro -- whom Nighy refers to as Mr. Ishiguro, despite, he said, being invited to call him by his nickname, Ish -- want him for the film?
"There's that kind of depressed, repressed rigorous constraint that we insist on living under," Nighy said, of traditional Englishmen. "Having met me, Mr. Ishiguro suddenly thought that I might be the link. I don't know why. I don't read anything about myself and I don't get around much anymore, but I'm aware that I am seen to be a certain kind of Englishman. It must be the result of certain parts I've played, I suppose."
But he was thrilled, he said. "I thought this is like Christmas, you know, that someone as distinguished and eminent and brilliant as Mr. Ishiguro should consider me that way."
Nighy did not set out to be an actor. Born in Caterham, Surrey, he grew up next to the gas station and car repair shop his father ran. When his early, amorphous plan to be a journalist fizzled, he enrolled in the Guildford School of Acting.
"I went to drama school because someone suggested I go to drama school, and the idea of being a student was very attractive," he said. "I thought I'd do it for a while. I didn't have any real serious thoughts about acting." Nonetheless, he said, "I got a gig and I got another one, and I kept going."
At first, he made so little money that he was exempt from income tax. He supplemented his earnings with other jobs. "I drove a mini cab for a while," he said. "That was a really bad idea. I used to pump gas, for obvious reasons. What else did I do? I was a dustman -- a refuse collector. I worked in a plastics factory. I sold full-length wraparound cheesecloth skirts at the Surrey Street Market in Croydon."
Unlike most classically trained British actors, he's not a fan of Shakespeare, at least not for himself.
"I'm aware that he's the greatest poet that ever lived, but the performing of it I leave to other people," he said. "I don't have any interest in the challenges of the iambic pentameter." Once, he said, he played Edgar in a production of "King Lear," directed by Hare and starring Anthony Hopkins in the title role. "I used to leap out of the hovel semi-naked every night, shouting impenetrable Shakespearean mad talk," he said.
He appeared in numerous films through the 1990s, but it wasn't until 2003, when Richard Curtis hired him to play Billy Mack, the scene-stealing has-been pop star in "Love Actually," that he had his breakthrough.
"The movie was about three-quarters cast, and we did a big read-through," Curtis recalled. "I asked the casting director to find me someone who there was no chance I would give the role to. I had seen Nighy onstage and thought he was wily and genteel and left-wing and completely wrong for the part." But five minutes into the read-through, he cast Nighy on the spot, and has put him in nearly everything he's done since.
Not that Nighy has seen any of those movies, or indeed any movie in which he appears.
"Well, would you fancy sitting down and watching yourself for a couple of hours?" he asked. "I tried it when I was younger and less complicated to look at, and there's nothing in it for me. I'm not the audience for my work. If I watch it, the whole thing is stolen from me."
In his spare time, he prefers to read, he said, and to go for long walks around London, dropping in on his favorite bookshops. If he has to go anywhere else, he takes a taxi or the subway to the train station. ("I don't own a car, because it's pointless," he said. "And I'm not a natural motorist. I have a hard time paying attention.")
His personal life since he separated from his longtime partner, the actress Diana Quick, is a bit of a mystery. Tall, slender and often dressed in beautifully tailored suits, he exudes a kind of old-fashioned, urbane elegance. Alas for his single fans, he is intermittently spotted at dinners and events with Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor, who hosted a screening of "Living," in New York last month.
He prefers not to discuss their relationship, if that is what it is. When asked, he has a stock response, most recently deployed in The Daily Telegraph. "I'd love to answer that," he said. "But if I did, I'd be involving the readers in something very close to gossip, and I know they'd never forgive me for that."
Has Nighy taken to heart the message suggested in the film, that you should live each day as if it is your last?
"A lot of the way you think about your age and mortality is either mythical or marketing," he said. "Somehow you're persuaded to think that certain things are outside of your age, or that you should be drawn to things because of your age. But I don't want to fall into any of those traps where I'm supposed to expect this or that. I'm a lucky guy. I just want to keep it lively."

'The Last of Us' Seeks a Path to Cross Over: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Hollywood has mostly failed to adapt successful video games into satisfying series and films. In an interview, the creators of this new zombie thriller explain why it can be the exception.
When "The Last of Us" came out in 2013, the hit video game's premise -- a fungus turns people into zombies, leaving society in shambles, and what government remains is controlled by fascists -- seemed squarely in the realm of fiction. A decade later, an HBO series based on the game is set to be released, on Sunday, to a public that has grown all too familiar with the possibility of a germ apocalypse.
The reality of what the world has been through over the past three years is alluded to in a chilling opening scene in which a pair of scientists describe the risk of various pathogens to a talk show audience. After one of them describes something like Covid-19, the other silences both the fictional crowd and us when he expounds upon the ways in which a warmed-up planet could lead to something much, much worse.
"Part of writing for an audience is just feeling in your bones what is cultural knowledge," said Craig Mazin, one of the showrunners. "On the other hand, it's not a show about the pandemic -- it's about what it means to survive and what's the purpose of survival. So we get that out of the way pretty quickly."
Over the past decade, as video games have become more vivid and complex, developers have used the medium to spin rich, character-based stories that rival film and TV in quality. "The Last of Us," for instance, is less about the actual outbreak than the father-daughter relationship between a smuggler named Joel (played by Pedro Pascal in the series) and a 14-year-old girl named Ellie (Bella Ramsey). Their journey across the United States, past zombies and cannibals, raises questions about the limits of love and the atrocities a parent will commit in the name of protecting a child.
But while a handful of game-to-screen adaptations like the "Tomb Raider," "Resident Evil" and "Sonic the Hedgehog" franchises have made enough money to warrant sequels, there is a sense that unlike, say, comic books, the stories in video games have never been properly translated.
"A lot of them have been embarrassing," said Neil Druckmann, who led the creation of "The Last of Us" and its 2020 sequel, "The Last of Us Part II," and created the HBO show with Mazin. (Druckmann is also a showrunner.)
For Hollywood that means a gold mine of intellectual property with a built-in audience of gamers has gone mostly unexploited. Given the pedigree of the creators -- Mazin created "Chernobyl," the Emmy-award winning mini-series, while Druckmann and his studio, Naughty Dog, are considered the benchmarks for narrative storytelling in games -- fans are hoping "The Last of Us" will be different. Either way, viewers should prepare to see more games onscreen soon: Other popular video game franchises with film and TV adaptations in the works include "Twisted Metal," "Ghost of Tsushima" and "Assassin's Creed."
In a joint video interview late last month, Mazin and Druckmann discussed "The Last of Us," what they changed from the game and what they didn't, and why their philosophy for adaptation was to cut away much of the action in order to make the post-apocalyptic world feel more real. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
The "Last of Us" games are about a global pandemic in which the cordyceps fungus , a real-life fungus that can take over the bodies and minds of insects, jumps to humans and turns people into zombies. Suddenly that premise feels a lot less fantastical.
CRAIG MAZIN Neil made the smart decision all these years ago to say, you know what, instead of some invented no-name zombie virus, or rage serum, or some supernatural hell-has-fallen-and-the-dead-will-walk-the-earth --
NEIL DRUCKMANN Radiation!
MAZIN Yeah, radiation, which is just an outrage. Instead of all that, why don't we go find something that's real? And he did. I mean, that's what cordyceps does to ants. I love the science of it.
DRUCKMANN Part of the game's success was that we try to treat it as grounded as possible. And with the show we're able to take that philosophy even further. So I think why the pandemic [in the games] feels so real, even though it was written before our current pandemic, is we were looking at things like Katrina. Like here's where government fails, here's where people can get really selfish, and here's where we can see these great acts of love.
In the games, the outbreak takes place in 2013 , whereas in the show it's 2003. Given that most of the story takes place 20 years later, after the world falls apart, I'm guessing the idea was to place the show in the present day?
MAZIN I have this thing about watching shows where a graphic comes up and says, "2053: London." And I'm like, "I don't know what 2053 is." The notion that there's this twist of fate, and 2023, instead of looking like this, it looks like this -- there's an immediacy to that. I probably inflated its importance in my mind, but it helped me.
Gamers are generally of the opinion that game adaptations are pretty horrible. You both seem to agree, and I'm wondering why you think they've been such a failure.
MAZIN There's a lot of cringe out there.
DRUCKMANN Sometimes the source material is just not strong enough for a direct adaptation. So all you're left with is a name that has some value to it, but really you're starting from scratch. Other times it's that the people in charge are not gamers. They don't understand what made this thing special. They hang on to really superficial things and they think, for example, plenty of players want to see that one gameplay moment or this one gun from the game.
MAZIN Terrific video games are terrific because of their gameplay, but conceptually they may already be copies of something. A copy of "Aliens." A copy of "Raiders of the Lost Ark." You adapt that and you have a copy of a copy and can just feel a lack of freshness to it.
So what did you try to do differently?
DRUCKMANN The most important thing was to keep the soul of it, what it's about: these relationships. What makes the show are the characters, the philosophical arguments of, "Do the ends justify the means?" And, "How big is your tribe that you're going to care for?"
The least important part was the gameplay. In the game we have long action sequences to get you into a flow state, which gets you to better connect with the character -- you see yourself as that character. But if you just try to throw that on the screen in the passive medium, it's not going to work. And that's the thing that people often get wrong. The conversation with Craig and with HBO, the encouragement, which I loved, was, "Don't focus on the action."
Given how many failures there have been, at least creatively, why do you think the appetite for game to TV or movie adaptations is suddenly so large?
MAZIN There's two possible reasons, one good and one not so good. The video game industry has been putting out some remarkable work. It seems natural that once these games achieve this impressive narrative space, you can start to think about porting them over. That's the good reason.
Here's the bad reason: Somebody in a room who doesn't know anything about playing video games looks at a PDF of how many copies are sold, and they go, "Well, let's just do that. We need the title and the character, and the character should look like the guy in the game, and then, whatever, we'll hire some people."
What are some of the differences in how you build a character for an interactive medium versus a passive one?
DRUCKMANN With a game, there are certain constraints. Joel [the game's main playable character] needs to be capable enough to mirror what you're doing in the game. So, for example, he's crouching and he's killing. If all of a sudden we had a scene where he's complaining about his knees, then there's this disconnect. The Joel in the show, because you don't have to support him crouch-walking or having to fight all these people, there was this idea of, "What if we explore his age and how broken down he is over the years?" Physically, he becomes a different person that's more realistic than what we could have done in the game.
MAZIN There are parts of games that, because of their design, have to violate reality. In "The Last of Us" -- or really any game where you're playing somebody that has guns, and you're fighting against other people that have guns -- you're going to get shot. And then you're going to heal yourself with a bandage, some pills, power-ups, whatever. So exploring the fragility of the body is part of how we honor this different medium. A single gunshot, if it's not fatal, can permanently damage you as a human being. There is no bandage for this.
Are you anxious about how fans of the game will react to changes?
MAZIN My job was to be connected with my own fandom and to think about myself as representative of a lot of people, and to ask what would be important to me, what would hurt if it weren't in the show. I believe that most fans are going to react positively to it, because we made it with love. But if people don't, I get that too. It's part of being deeply connected to something.
DRUCKMANN My fear, and this just gets into a general conversation around fandom, is that our cast or anybody from our crew will get attacked or insulted as we make certain changes. After "The Last of Us II," nothing anybody says online can get to me anymore. But I hate when anybody else gets it.
You're referring to the online harassment , including death threats , surrounding, among other things, the gender and sexuality of certain characters in the "Last of Us" games, which is also explored in the show.
DRUCKMANN I've learned to just accept it and not to give it too much weight. I tend to not be driven by fear. If anything, I lean the opposite. When there's a certain backlash to an idea, I'm like, then it's an idea worth exploring.
As a fan of the games, I found myself having a kind of reverse uncanny valley type reaction to Ellie in the show, where I was like, "But that's not Ellie." It made me realize how deeply I've connected to the game version of Ellie, who is voiced by Ashley Johnson but is a digital character . Unlike a live actress, who you realize is a person and might see in other things, you don't see Ellie anywhere else, so she almost seems to belong to the story.
MAZIN What I said to Bella is, people are going to probably have a reaction to you, not unlike Joel's reaction, which is: "Who is this? This isn't my daughter. This isn't the person I love. The person I love looks like this and acts like this, and you're not it ... but I guess I'm stuck with you for a bit."
And then: "Well, you're kind of growing on me ... Actually, I think you're pretty great ... You know what? I would kill anyone to protect you."
That's kind of how it works with Joel and Ellie, and that's kind of how I think it's going to work with the part of the audience that, like you and like me, has such an attachment to the Ellie that Neil and Ashley created in the game. That's what Bella does magically. Bella does not beg for your approval -- I'm talking about her Ellie -- she just is that character and you, like Joel, are falling in love with her.

Full text: The city offers plenty of options for honoring the civil rights leader. See musical performances, experience activism discussions and learn about Seneca Village.
Every year since 1983, the third Monday in January has been observed as a federal holiday to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, and to recognize his tireless crusade of nonviolence and the fight for racial equality for Black Americans. This year, on Jan. 16 and throughout the month, cultural centers, theaters and art institutions have organized activist panels, quilt-making projects, film screenings and performances.
Here are six ways to memorialize the civil rights leader, whose legacy, more than a half century after his death, is still remembered through acts of service.
Bonanza at the Brooklyn Academy of Music
For the 37th year, the Brooklyn Academy of Music will present a free virtual and in-person tribute to King on Jan. 16 at 10:30 a.m. Along with a keynote speech by Sherrilyn Ifill, a former president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, guests can enjoy performances by the activist and artist Allison Russell and the Sing Harlem choir.
In "Courage Takes Creativity," a kid-friendly event beginning at 10:30 a.m., participants can learn Guinean and Haitian songs and dances, create photo art using snapshots of civil rights moments, build their own flags and more. At 1 p.m., grab a seat for a screening of the film "My Name is Pauli Murray," which documents the trailblazing civil rights attorney who inspired King and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
From Jan. 12-20, attendees can visit "Freedom!," a visual art project made up of digital billboards inspired by the playwright Lorraine Hansberry, and enjoy jam sessions with the bassist Russell Hall on Jan. 13 at 9 p.m. and the jazz-rock power trio Harriet Tubman on Jan. 14 at 9 p.m.
Celebratory Music
On Jan. 14, an Afrofuturist twist on "The Sound of Music," "The Sound of (Black) Music," features a fusion of gospel, jazz, blues and funk. The concert begins at 10:30 p.m. at the Manderley Bar in the McKittrick Hotel in Chelsea, home to "Sleep No More," the immersive theater performance. Those in search of a spiritual celebration on Jan. 16 can enjoy the powerhouse vocals of the Harlem Gospel Choir in a 1:30 p.m. performance at Sony Hall in Midtown.
Social Groundbreakers at the Apollo
At the Apollo's 17th annual King celebration, presented with WNYC, "MLK -- Blueprint for the Culture," WNYC's Kai Wright will speak to the activist Chelsea Miller and the author Imani Perry and break down Nina Simone's soulful song "To Be Young, Gifted and Black," while also discussing what activism looks like for younger generations. Going deeper into the music found in social justice movements, the Apollo will also feature performances by the classical music collective Harlem Chamber Players, the vocal ensemble Dream Launchers and the tenor Chauncey Packer. The program, which is part of the Apollo's Uptown Hall series, takes place on Jan. 15 at 3 p.m. in the theater, and will be streamed virtually. At 5 p.m., young activists and community leaders will take the Apollo's virtual stage to address topics like gun violence and reproductive rights in a panel discussion.
Crafts and Tours for the Family
Inspired by King's visit to Gee's Bend, Ala., quilting returns to Wave Hill garden and cultural center in the Bronx, as a part of its weekly family art project. From 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Jan. 14, children and adults can learn about shapes and colors as they patch together fabric cutouts and personalize their quilts, influenced by the Freedom Quilting Bee community led by Black women in Gee's Bend in the 1960s, who shared quilt-making techniques across generations.
At 11 a.m. on Jan. 15, and on other select days, visitors can tour the area near Central Park's perimeter where Seneca Village once stood, and learn about the neighborhood's rich history. Before laying the framework for Central Park in 1858, Seneca Village provided solace for a predominantly Black community fleeing unfavorable living conditions and racial discrimination in Lower Manhattan.
Theater Highlighting Black Stories
The Broadway revival of August Wilson's "The Piano Lesson" has been extended through Jan. 29 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater. The play, which was first staged in 1987 and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama three years later, follows a family battle over a haunted piano and the generational trauma and grief attached to it. In her review, Maya Phillips, a New York Times critic at large, wrote, "What haunts the Charles household is what haunts Black America every day -- the living history of racial violence and pervasive inequality."
Over at the Helen Hayes Theater, "Between Riverside and Crazy" (which also took home a Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2015), runs through Feb. 12. The 2014 play by Stephen Adly Guirgis follows Walter, a former police officer, and his son Junior (played by the rapper Common), who struggle to hold onto a rent-stabilized apartment on Riverside Drive.
King Documentaries
The harrowing 2015 film "Selma," starring David Oyelowo, depicts King's incessant efforts, despite violent opposition, to secure the Black vote through the introduction of the Voting Rights Act. For another streaming option, the 2020 documentary "MLK/FBI" examines an F.B.I. director's unsettling obsession with King's personal life and political affiliations, and his determination to bring down the civil rights leader. In a 2021 review, A.O. Scott, The Times's co-chief film critic, wrote that the minute details make the documentary "suspenseful, visually engrossing and intellectually bracing" and that it "raises urgent, sometimes uncomfortable questions about power, privacy and the ethical challenges of examining the past."

Vulnerability Strengthens a Warrior: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She plays a ferocious warrior in "The Woman King," but in her performance, vulnerability and humanity were what she sought to convey.
When Lashana Lynch learned that the filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewood wanted to talk to her about a project, she was ready to say yes, whatever it was.
She had been in love with Prince-Bythewood's work ever since "Love & Basketball," her feature film directorial debut, Lynch, 35, said in a video interview from London last month. "I'd work with her any day."
The project, it turned out, was "The Woman King," a historical drama set in 1823 about an army of female soldiers in West Africa. Prince-Bythewood had written the role of Izogie -- a devoted warrior to the battalion's leader, played by Viola Davis, and a mentor to a would-be fighter (Thuso Mbedu) -- with Lynch in mind.
"Coming from a Black female director, that made me so emotional because I thought, 'Wow, she's really thought of me as a human being,"' said Lynch, an actress known for her performances in the James Bond movie "No Time to Die" and more recently as Captain Marvel in "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness." "She's considered who I am, what I've done, but also things that I haven't shown the world yet."'
As shooting on "The Woman King" progressed, the role grew as Lynch shared ideas about Izogie's back story with Prince-Bythewood, who incorporated some of them into the script.
"We just knew her," Lynch said. "She was birthed on her own, which is quite Izogie of her, actually. She showed us who she was, and we listened."
Lynch answered three questions about Izogie's driving forces. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
How do you think the character of Izogie challenges gender norms?
As soon as I got the role, I thought, "OK, here we go." A woman in an all-female army, very, very physically strong, mentally strong -- we are now going into what, in the wrong hands, would be the strong Black woman trope that I'm always on the hunt to dismantle. And this is a really great way of doing that, softly.
Izogie is tasked with showing young women how their vulnerability and what they come with organically can be their superpower. For me as an actor characterizing Izogie, I thought, "I want her masculine and feminine energy to be equally as powerful and equally as seen." I think that's what we did between me and Gina. We allowed her to just be, and to not think about who Izogie would be compared to, or if she would be considered the really strong, physically built, masculine woman in the army.
She would just be a woman in all her glory, which she deserves to be. I just wanted her to live.
What do you see as the source of her power?
We as human beings have such an interesting way of handling trauma through humor. It is a really interesting tell when you meet someone, and they've been through something, and when they speak about it, they smile or they laugh or they brush it off and move on.
I think it's such an incredibly beautiful, protective way of being that Izogie, doing that in the powerful position that she's in, really reminds us as audience members that, "Oh yeah, I'm human. I'm just going about the world in the way that I know how to protect myself." She teaches us to be OK not to be OK.
The majority of the movie you think that she's in such control, which, in a way, she is. But really there's such vulnerability there, and fear and angst and essentially trauma that she's working through. She has an organic way of existing authentically, which can be scary to do, but she doesn't do it in a way that seems out of reach for us mere mortals watching the screen thinking, "I want to aspire to do that."
She's also not a superhero. She's a woman going about her daily life, doing the best she can in the most creative way that she can. I love superheroes, and they serve their purpose. But there's nothing like a real human being having natural superpowers just by being born and using them in a great way.
Why should people watch "The Woman King"?
I would say that "The Woman King" is a film that people from all walks of life have been waiting for but just didn't anticipate the package in which it would come.
Now we have the package. We can appreciate physical action. We can appreciate actors going 100 with the stunts themselves. We can appreciate Black women existing as the humanized versions of themselves instead of this uber-strong, uber-elevated, nonhuman version that is unreal.
We also get to re-educate the world on why Black history is so important to all sectors on this planet, without bashing anyone around the head with it. We are just presenting information in the most strong, beautiful, delicate, sometimes understated narrative that makes you feel good, but also makes you question what you are doing for the world and how you want to exist here.
What footprint do you want to leave on the planet? What's your purpose? I'm hoping that some people have at least started on the journey to finding that through watching this movie.

Full text: Four editors and one critic share their wish lists for best picture, best actress and best actor.
In addition to the Academy Award nominees our chief film critics Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott would name, five other movie-loving New York Times staffers weighed in with their selections for three of the big prizes: best picture, best actress and best actor. (Except for the featured pick, the slates are in alphabetical order, with 10 entries for best picture and five for the acting categories, as in the official nominations.)
These aren't predictions so much as wishful thinking, and we will see when the nominations are announced on Jan. 24 how much we overlap, if at all, with Academy voters.
Stephanie Goodman, Film Editor
For Best Picture: "The Woman King"
I walked into "The Woman King," directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, knowing little about it beyond the trailer and walked out utterly exhilarated. It had the crisp action scenes, edge-of-your-seat intrigue and array of soldier characters that are hallmarks of most great war movies. But watching women (including the tremendous Viola Davis, Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim and Lashana Lynch) do the fighting and bonding was unexpectedly emotional. (Read our review; rent or buy the film on Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ or other platforms.)
"After Yang" (Kogonada)
"All the Beauty and the Bloodshed" (Laura Poitras)
"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever" (Ryan Coogler)
"Everything Everywhere All at Once" (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert)
"Kimi" (Steven Soderbergh)
"Living" (Oliver Hermanus)
"Nanny" (Nikyatu Jusu)
"Nope" (Jordan Peele)
"Saint Omer" (Alice Diop)
Mekado Murphy, Assistant Film Editor
For Best Picture: "Barbarian"
With its bleak, rainy nights and ominous, do-NOT-go-down-there basements, "Barbarian," written and directed by Zach Cregger, is the kind of horror movie that makes you believe you know exactly where it's headed. That it shatters those expectations is just part of its darkly delightful appeal. It's a jump-scare popcorn movie that is also engaged in a thoughtful conversation with the audience. (Read our review and watch on HBO Max.)
"Aftersun" (Charlotte Wells)
"The Banshees of Inisherin" (Martin McDonagh)
"Emily the Criminal" (John Patton Ford)
"Everything Everywhere All at Once" (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert)
"The Fabelmans" (Steven Spielberg)
"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery" (Rian Johnson)
"Nope" (Jordan Peele)
"Pleasure" (Ninja Thyberg)
"Tár" (Todd Field)
Jason M. Bailey, Senior Staff Editor
For Best Picture: "Aftersun"
Having a young daughter may make me susceptible to the formative years depicted in "Aftersun," "Petite Maman" and "The Florida Project," but these family close-ups deserve a wider audience. After all, we were all once young daughters or sons. By layering innocuous scenes from a poignant vacation -- frolicking at the pool, fretting in the hotel room -- Charlotte Wells delivers a staggering debut feature. May her filmmaking never grow old. (Read our review; buy it on Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ or other platforms.)
"The Banshees of Inisherin" (Martin McDonagh)
"Catherine Called Birdy" (Lena Dunham)
"Decision to Leave" (Park Chan-wook)
"Everything Everywhere All at Once" (Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert)
"Happening" (Audrey Diwan)
"Kimi" (Steven Soderbergh)
"Resurrection" (Andrew Semans)
"Tár" (Todd Field)
"Turning Red" (Domee Shi)
Jason Farago, Critic at Large
For Best Actress: Guslagie Malanda, "Saint Omer"
Alice Diop's meticulous courtroom drama -- an inquiry into motherhood, migration and the gaps between juridical and psychological truth -- is the most intelligent film of the year. But "Saint Omer" has a heart as well as a brain. As Laurence, a Senegalese philosophy student on trial in France for killing her daughter, Guslagie Malanda provides a performance as cathartic as any Greek tragedian's: so precise, so hard-boiled, so controlled in its torment that a monstrous crime opens onto unplumbed depths. (Amazingly, this is only Malanda's second movie; she's better known in Paris as a curator of contemporary art.) In the dock at Saint Omer, she turns inscrutability into a moral summons: to probe our societies and our souls in all their violence and grace.
Alina Khan, "Joyland"
Vicky Krieps, "Corsage"
Diamond Stingily, "The African Desperate"
Tang Wei, "Decision to Leave"
Andrew LaVallee, Arts & Leisure Editor
For Best Actor: Daniel Radcliffe, "Weird: The Al Yankovic Story"
There has been so much talk over the past year about how weak the 2023 best actor category is, but maybe that would change if we thought and watched more expansively. "Weird," the only sporadically true story of the pop-parody genius Al Yankovic, is not eligible for Oscars consideration because it wasn't released theatrically, but show me a more committed, passionate, surprisingly ripped and uproariously entertaining performance than Daniel Radcliffe as Weird Al. I'm willing to die on this hill. (Watch it on Roku.)
Nicolas Cage, "The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent"
Diego Calva, "Babylon"
Tom Cruise, "Top Gun: Maverick"
Park Hae-il, "Decision to Leave"

A 20-Year-Old Camera Is Gen Z's Hottest Gadget: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Huang, Kalley

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Young people are opting for point-and-shoots and blurry photos.
Last spring, Anthony Tabarez celebrated prom like many of today's high schoolers: dancing the night away and capturing it through photos and videos. The snapshots show Mr. Tabarez, 18, and his friends grinning, jumping around and waving their arms from a crowded dance floor.
But instead of using his smartphone, Mr. Tabarez documented prom night with an Olympus FE-230, a 7.1-megapixel, silver digital camera made in 2007 and previously owned by his mother. During his senior year of high school, cameras like it started appearing in classrooms and at social gatherings. On prom night, Mr. Tabarez passed around his camera, which snapped fuchsia-tinted photos that looked straight from the early aughts.
"We're so used to our phones," said Mr. Tabarez, a freshman at California State University, Northridge. "When you have something else to shoot on, it's more exciting."
The cameras of Generation Z's childhoods, seen as outdated and pointless by those who originally owned them, are in vogue again. Young people are reveling in the novelty of an old look, touting digital cameras on TikTok and sharing the photos they produce on Instagram. On TikTok, the hashtag #digitalcamera has 184 million views.
Modern influencers like Kylie Jenner, Bella Hadid and Charli D'Amelio are encouraging the fun and mimicking their early 2000s counterparts by taking blurry, overlit photos. Instead of paparazzi publishing these photos in tabloids or on gossip websites, influencers are posting them on social media.
Most of today's teenagers and youngest adults were infants at the turn of the millennium. Gen Z-ers grew up with smartphones that increasingly had it all, making stand-alone cameras, mapping devices and other gadgets unnecessary. They are now in search of a break from their smartphones; last year, 36 percent of U.S. teenagers said they spent too much time on social media, according to the Pew Research Center.
That respite is coming in part through compact point-and-shoot digital cameras, uncovered by Gen Z-ers who are digging through their parents' junk drawers and shopping secondhand. Camera lines like the Canon Powershot and Kodak EasyShare are among their finds, popping up at parties and other social events.
Over the past few years, nostalgia for the Y2K era, a time of both tech enthusiasm and existential dread that spanned the late 1990s and early 2000s, has seized Generation Z. The nostalgia has spread across TikTok, fueling fashion trends like low-rise pants, velour tracksuits and dresses over jeans. Mall-stalwart brands like Abercrombie & Fitch and Juicy Couture have reaped the benefits; in 2021, Abercrombie reported its highest net sales since 2014. Now, there is Y2K nostalgia for the technology that captured these outfits when they were first popular.
This time, the poor picture quality isn't for lack of a better tool. It's on purpose.
Compared to today's smartphones, older digital cameras have fewer megapixels, which capture less detail, and built-in lenses with higher apertures, which let in less light, both of which contribute to lower-quality photos. But in a feed of more or less standard smartphone photos, the quirks of photos taken with digital cameras are now considered treasures instead of reasons for deletion.
"People are realizing it's fun to have something not attached to their phone," said Mark Hunter, a photographer also known as the Cobrasnake. "You're getting a different result than you're used to. There's a bit of delay in gratification."
Mr. Hunter, 37, cut his teeth documenting nightlife in the early aughts using his digital camera. In those photos, celebrities -- including a "You Belong With Me"-era Taylor Swift and the newly famous Kim Kardashian -- look like ordinary partygoers, caught in the harsh light of Mr. Hunter's camera.
He now photographs a new cohort of influencers and stars, but the photos would be nearly indistinguishable from his older ones if his subjects were clutching flip phones instead of iPhones. They are rewinding the clock to 2007 and "basically reliving every episode of 'The Simple Life,"' he said, referring to a reality television show from that era that features Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.
But many new point-and-shoot digital cameras come with today's bells and whistles, and older models have been discontinued, so people are turning to thrift stores and secondhand e-commerce sites to find cameras with sufficiently vintage looks. On eBay, searches for "digital camera" increased by 10 percent from 2021 to 2022, with searches for specific models seeing even steeper jumps, said Davina Ramnarine, a company spokeswoman. For example, searches for "Nikon COOLPIX" increased by 90 percent, she said.
Zounia Rabotson's earliest memories are of traveling and posing in front of monuments and tourist attractions as her mother pressed a button and a digital camera whirred to life. Now a model in New York City, she has returned to her mother's digital camera, a Canon PowerShot SX230 HS made in 2011.
On Instagram, Ms. Rabotson, 22, posts grainy, overexposed photos of herself wearing denim miniskirts and carrying tiny luxury handbags. She says that she looks up to models from her childhood and that taking photos in a similar style makes her "feel like I'm them."
"I feel like we're becoming a bit too techy," she said. "To go back in time is just a great idea."
Ms. Rabotson doesn't disconnect entirely. She has featured her camera on social media, captioning her fourth most popular video on TikTok: "Pov" -- point of view -- "you fell in love with digital cameras again."
On TikTok, teenagers and young adults now show off cameras nearly as old as they are and explain how to achieve a "new aesthetic." The cameras are not always well received. After the influencer Amalie Bladt posted a video on TikTok telling viewers to "buy the cheapest digital camera you find" for "the over exposure look," some of the more than 900 commenters responded in horror.
"NO NO NOOOOO PLS NO, I CANT RELIVE THIS ERA," one person commented. "I swear I'm not that old."
But the comments by despairing millennials and people with more modern tastes were overwhelmed by those where users had tagged their friends and asked how to upload photos from their digital camera to their smartphone.
Among some Gen Z-ers, the digital camera has become popular because it appears more authentic online, and not necessarily because it is a break from the internet, said Brielle Saggese, a lifestyle strategist at the trend forecasting company WGSN Insight. Photos taken with digital cameras can impart "a layer of personality that most iPhone content doesn't," she said.
"We want our devices to quietly blend into our surroundings and not be visible," Ms. Saggese said. "The Y2K aesthetic has turned that on its head," she added, describing mirror selfies and photos where digital cameras are visible accessories as "stylistic choices."
Rudra Sondhi, a freshman at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, started using his grandmother's digital camera because it seemed like a happy medium between film cameras and smartphones. He estimates that he takes one photo with his digital camera for every five with his smartphone.
"When I look back at my digital photos" -- from his actual camera -- "I have very specific memories attached to them," Mr. Sondhi said. "When I go through the camera roll on my phone, I sort of remember the moment and it's not special."
Mr. Sondhi, 18, shares photos taken with his digital camera on a separate Instagram account, @rudrascamera. These photos document the range of young adulthood, from goofing around in a college dorm room to moshing at a performance by The Weeknd. When he takes out his camera, he said, his friends immediately deem the moment special.
For Sadie Grey Strosser, 22, using digital cameras has represented the beginning of a different life stage. She took a semester off from Williams College during the pandemic and began using her parents' Canon Powershot. Her photography Instagram account, @mysexyfotos, cataloged nights out and long drives in low-contrast, washed-out snapshots.
"I felt so off the grid, and it almost went hand in hand, using a camera that wasn't connected to a phone," she said.
When her digital camera broke last summer, Ms. Strosser said she was "so upset." She later started using her grandmother's Sony Cyber-shot, which had "such a different character." Meanwhile, she said, if her iPhone broke, "I couldn't care less."

Full text: Making movies about writers is notoriously difficult, though the temptation is clear. After all, filmmakers, like authors, are storytellers, and are drawn to other people who tell them. But as with any other kind of story, clichés often do those movies in: The poet laments via ponderous voice-over narration. Words clack across the screen letter by letter in Smith Corona font. The writer bangs ardently at the keyboard when the muse strikes and stares moodily into a landscape when she fails to show.
Oh, the tortured life of the writer! Onscreen, it's often a bore.
But a new documentary, "Turn Every Page -- The Adventures of Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb," shows that success here is possible. And unlike most films about writers, it goes one step further, tackling not only the writing process but also the more abstruse art of the edit.
It helps to have two geniuses as subjects. Robert Caro, the author of "The Power Broker" and a multivolume biography of Lyndon B. Johnson -- he is currently working on the fifth and final book -- is one of the most revered nonfiction writers of our time. Robert Gottlieb is one of the most revered editors. The two Bobs have worked together for five decades; readers and viewers alike are fortunate that the latter Bob's daughter, Lizzie Gottlieb, persuaded them to take part in a documentary about their shared endeavors.
Readers are familiar with Caro's accomplishments: his mastery of the biography, of history, of the subject of power -- and crucially, its impact on the powerless. "The Power Broker," his biography of Robert Moses, held an almost required pride of place on every talking head's Zoom bookshelf during lockdown.
Let me use this column, then, to draw attention to the less celebrated art, one that is not cited on the cover of that book but is showcased in the film: the work of the editor.
I'll admit I'm biased. I'm enormously fortunate to know both Bobs personally and to consider Bob Gottlieb a friend and, occasionally -- even though he has never been my actual editor, but because he can't help doing what he does best -- an editor.
I first met Bob Gottlieb a decade ago, at (cliché) a book party. The room was noisy, and I heard neither his name when he was introduced nor half of what he said to me over the next 30 minutes. I was newly installed as the editor of The New York Times Book Review and Bob had a lot to tell me. As I was leaving, a publicist rushed up to me nervously and said, "That was some conversation you had with Bob Gottlieb."
Bob Gottlieb! Now I was nervous. What had I said to the legendary Gottlieb? I quailed, fleeing the scene. The former editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, the former editor of The New Yorker, the former president, publisher and editor in chief of Alfred A. Knopf, a man whose writers included Toni Morrison and Chaim Potok, Michael Crichton and Doris Lessing, Joseph Heller, Nora Ephron, Barbara Tuchman, Sidney Poitier, Salman Rushdie, John Cheever and John le Carré. If I'd only known I'd been talking to Bob Gottlieb.
Several years later, after devouring Gottlieb's memoir, "Avid Reader," I wrote him directly and we had the first of many lunches. "When you get back to your desk, send me your manuscript," he said of a book I'd just finished writing. The next day he emailed me a full editorial note with wise and occasionally stern suggestions. I was gobsmacked.
But that's just how Gottlieb works. He gets a manuscript, he reads it overnight, he responds to the author right away. "To me, not doing that was cruelty to animals," he explains in "Turn Every Page." "But also, I couldn't wait." For Gottlieb, editing, like reading, is an obsession. "If you haven't been a reader, don't try to be an editor because why would you want to be?" Bob says at Columbia Journalism School in the documentary. "It is making public your own enthusiasm."
Of course, a good editor does more than that. To make "The Power Broker" physically publishable, Gottlieb helped Caro cut roughly 350,000 words from the book. Later he intuited that Caro's next project should be different from the book he was contracted to write; separately, the two Bobs both landed on Lyndon Johnson as its subject. On the page, words like "loom" can provoke endless debate. "If you are not strong enough to give the writer what he needs, which is your true, strong opinion, if you have to hold back," Gottlieb says in the film, "it is not going to work."
But the job requires restraint as much as force. "Editing is intelligent and sympathetic reaction to the text and to what the author is trying to accomplish," Gottlieb explains. "When you try to change something into something that it isn't, rather than make it better at what it is, tragedy lurks." As Gottlieb sees it, editing is a service job. "It's not your book."
And yet, despite disputes over semicolons, the two Bobs achieve a rare feat between author and editor -- perhaps the key to a true masterpiece -- shared intention.
"When I'm writing a book, on some very deep level, Bob Gottlieb and I are thinking about the same book," Caro says in the film. "If I say to him, 'I'm going to do a whole book on the stolen election, Bob, it was just supposed to be one chapter when we thought about it,' he seldom even asks me why. He just sort of agrees. It's a priceless thing for a writer to have something like that."
Until now that work has gone largely unseen. Both Bobs originally refused to participate in the film, according to Lizzie Gottlieb. "They said the work between a writer and an editor is too private for anyone else to see."
"Turn Every Page" offers a glimpse into that secretive process. And it does so at an apt moment. Book sales were down in 2022, and with ongoing challenges to printing, distributing and promoting books in a country where the publishing and media infrastructure has shifted dramatically over the last two decades, editors are working harder than ever. In a constrained marketplace, they have less time to devote to the painstaking art of what Gottlieb calls "making public your enthusiasm."
The film "Turn Every Page" took five years to make. Caro says his books take at least seven years each to write. And they can take years more to edit and publish well. That can be the cost and commitment of an exceptional book, one intended to endure beyond a print run or two. When storytellers have the time and support to do what they're meant to do best, the result is everyone's enduring good fortune.

Full text: Now that critics' laurels and box office results are in, the race for the top honor is clearer. But there's still room for an outside contender to slip in.
Earlier this week, I got a text from a harried colleague. "I'm not ready for Oscar season," she wrote.
I blinked for a second before responding. Ready? This season has been going for months!
Of course, I took her point: January ramps things up considerably, since we're about to get televised awards shows (the Golden Globes on Tuesday followed by the Critics Choice Awards the following Sunday), nominations from the acting, directing and producing guilds, and then the all-important Oscar nominations, which will be announced Jan. 24.
But we can already make an educated guess about the titles we'll hear that day, since your Projectionist has spent the last few months weighing valuable factors like voter buzz, box office battles, laurels from critics groups, below-the-line Oscar shortlists, and influential citations like the Gothams and the American Film Institute Awards. With all that in mind, I've arrived at a list of 10 movies that I think currently have the greatest shot at making the best picture lineup.
Still, this is an unusual year when even the strongest movies come with significant debits, which means there's still room for big-budget entertainments (like "Babylon," "Nope," "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery" and "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"), foreign-language films (including "RRR," "Decision to Leave" and "All Quiet on the Western Front"), and indie films with strong performances (like "The Whale," "Till," "She Said" and "Aftersun") to pull through. At this time last year, "CODA" looked like a middle-of-the-road contender, but a few consequential weeks later, it won enough hearts to clinch the best picture Oscar.
So consider these 10 films to merely be the starting lineup, ranked in descending order according to their certainty.
'Everything Everywhere All at Once'
After making a film with sci-fi trappings and outlandish dildo fight scenes, the directors of "Everything Everywhere" never expected it to become an awards-season sensation. Still, if you look under the hood, this movie has everything Oscar voters typically spark to: It's a critically acclaimed box office hit with a veteran star in a showcase role (Michelle Yeoh), a wildly rootable actor making his long-awaited comeback (Ke Huy Quan), and an original, inventive story that concludes with a series of heartwarming scenes. The only downside (and it could prove to be a potent one) is that many older voters just can't get past the aforementioned sci-fi trappings and dildo fight scenes, and the film's appeal is therefore lost on them. Will the passion of the academy's younger and hipper voters be enough to make up that shortfall and push "Everything Everywhere" to the top?
'The Fabelmans'
Though we may think of Steven Spielberg as an Oscar staple, it's been more than two decades since he won his last statuette, for "Saving Private Ryan" (1998). If voters consider the most successful director of all time to be overdue for another little gold man, they might think it fitting to reward him for "The Fabelmans," the most personal project he's ever made. This semi-autobiographical family drama was hobbled by headlines about its meager box office take, but it's hardly the only prestige drama to struggle in theaters this year. And once the nominations are sorted, the film should fare very well on the preferential ballot for best picture, which favors consensus crowd-pleasers.
'The Banshees of Inisherin'
Could nearly half of the 20 acting nominations be sewn up by just two movies? If "Everything Everywhere" overperforms, Yeoh, Quan, and supporting actresses Stephanie Hsu and Jamie Lee Curtis could all be nominated. Ditto Martin McDonagh's "The Banshees of Inisherin," which I think has an even better shot at earning nominations for all four of its principal actors: leading man Colin Farrell and his supporting co-stars Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon. (Sadly, Jenny the donkey was not eligible last time I checked.) And though McDonagh failed to make it into the best director lineup for his last film, "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri," the stunningly photographed vistas of "Inisherin" ought to put him over the top this time.
'Tár'
Don't be fooled by the recent best picture wins for simple-pleasure dramedies like "CODA" and "Green Book": There is still a significant bloc of highbrow voters within the academy, and I suspect "Tár" will serve as their standard-bearer. Todd Field's ruthlessly contemporary drama about a disgraced conductor has already entranced critics: The New York Film Critics Circle and Los Angeles Film Critics Association both awarded Cate Blanchett's lead performance and voted "Tár" the best film of the year (though the West Coast group split the difference on the latter, claiming a tie between "Tár" and "Everything Everywhere"). Field made the best picture lineup back in 2002 for his first film, "In the Bedroom," and voters will be pleased to see that their early bet on him has more than paid off.
'Avatar: The Way of Water'
James Cameron's first "Avatar" was presumed to be the runner-up in 2010's best picture race, which ultimately crowned his ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow's military drama "The Hurt Locker." Can "The Way of Water" succeed where the first film failed? I don't think it's got much of a chance at actually winning best picture, since Cameron has often said that the franchise is mapped out over five movies, and voters will probably wait until the far-off denouement to decide the ultimate worth of the series, as they did with the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Still, a long list of nominations is all but certain, since the movie is both a blockbuster triumph and a dazzling auteurist work that only Cameron could have pulled off.
'Elvis'
It's been 21 years since director Baz Luhrmann scored an Oscar breakthrough with the musical "Moulin Rouge" -- which was nominated for eight Oscars and won two -- and I expect he'll be welcomed back in a big way for this glittery biopic of the iconic singer, played by surefire best actor nominee Austin Butler. One of the year's only adult dramas to succeed in theaters, "Elvis" plays as though "Bohemian Rhapsody" were executed with actual panache, and Luhrmann's maximalist aesthetic could even push him into the best director lineup, since that branch goes gaga for technical audacity.
'Top Gun: Maverick'
If a well-reviewed action sequel becomes the biggest movie of the year and helps bolster struggling theaters, shouldn't that be enough to cram it into the best picture race? Well, that argument didn't get "Spider-Man: No Way Home" into last year's lineup, but domestic box office champ "Top Gun: Maverick" is already off to a better start, picking up best film nominations from the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards that eluded Marvel's web-slinger. But is this Tom Cruise star vehicle actually about something, or is it just a high-flying entertainment? Oscar voters tend to turn their nose up at action sequels -- the only one nominated for best picture in the last 15 years was George Miller's astonishing "Mad Max: Fury Road" -- and the next phase of this awards campaign will have to convince them that there's more to "Top Gun: Maverick" than meets the eye.
'Triangle of Sadness'
After "Parasite" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival nearly four years ago, the upstart film studio Neon successfully leveraged the movie's international appeal and turned it into an awards-season darling. Can the studio pull off the same feat for Ruben Ostlund's social satire "Triangle of Sadness," which also took the Palme and similarly mines class warfare for big laughs and shocking set pieces? It helps that this cruise-ship comedy has a secret weapon in supporting-actress contender Dolly de Leon, who plays a maid-turned-despot: At a time when most contenders are still wary of ascribing too much weight to the controversial Golden Globes, the Filipina actress has drawn headlines for discussing how much the Globe nomination means to her, and many Oscar voters will be eager to extend her awards-season moment.
'Women Talking'
After a big fall-festival launch, Sarah Polley's well-reviewed Mennonite drama may have waited a little too long to come out in theaters: It was swallowed in limited release over the Christmas weekend, and will have a rough go expanding into new locations until the Oscar nominations are announced. Still, Polley is a respected actress-turned-director, the ensemble is filled with awards-friendly ringers like Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley and Frances McDormand, and the film's bracing conversations about gender and sexual assault make a strong case for its relevance.
'The Woman King'
Gina Prince-Bythewood's well-mounted action epic about female warriors in 19th-century Africa has an Oscar-winning star in Viola Davis and a lot of handsome tech elements, though I'm concerned that it didn't manage to make the Oscar shortlists for its superlative costume design and hair and makeup. (At least Terence Blanchard's thundering score made the cut in its category.) Next week's Producers Guild nominations could foretell the film's ultimate fate, since that group likes to recognize rousing theatrical successes and "The Woman King," which earned a worldwide gross nearly double its $ 50 million budget, will almost certainly show up there if it's got the mettle to impress awards voters.

‘OK, Mexico, Save Me’: After China, This Is Where Globalization May Lead

MEXICO CITY — As American companies recalibrate the risks of relying on Chinese factories to make their goods, some are shifting business to a country far closer to home: Mexico.
The unfolding trend known as “near-shoring” has drawn the attention of no less than Walmart, the global retail empire with headquarters in Arkansas.
Early in 2022, when Walmart needed $1 million of company uniforms — more than 50,000 in one order — it bought them not from its usual suppliers in China but from Preslow, a family-run apparel business in Mexico.
It was February 2022, and the contours of global trade seemed up for alteration. The worst pandemic in a century had upended shipping. The cost of transporting products across the Pacific had skyrocketed, and ports were choked with floating traffic jams — a stark indication of the dangers of depending on a single faraway country for critical goods.
Among multinational companies, decades of faith in the merits of making things in China had come under scrutiny, especially as animosity intensified between Washington and Beijing.
At his office in Mexico City, Isaac Presburger, director of sales at Preslow, took Walmart’s order as a sign of his country’s evolving role in the economy, and the opportunities that flow from sharing the same side of the Pacific with the United States.
“Walmart had a big problem with their supply,” Presburger recounted. “They said, ‘OK, Mexico, save me.’”
Basic geography is a driver for U.S. companies moving business to Mexico. Shipping a container full of goods to the United States from China generally requires a month — a time frame that doubled and tripled during the worst disruptions of the pandemic. Yet factories in Mexico and retailers in the United States can be bridged within two weeks.
“Everybody who sources from China understands that there’s no way to get around that Pacific Ocean — there’s no technology for that,” said Raine Mahdi, founder of Zipfox, a San Diego-based company that links factories in Mexico with American companies seeking alternatives to Asia. “There’s always this push from customers: ‘Can you get it here faster?’”
During the first 10 months of 2022, Mexico exported $382 billion of goods to the United States, an increase of more than 20% over the same period in 2021, according to U.S. census data. Since 2019, American imports of Mexican goods have swelled by more than one-fourth.
In 2021, American investors put more money into Mexico — buying companies and financing projects — than into China, according to an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute.
China will almost certainly remain a central component of manufacturing for years, say trade experts. But the shift toward Mexico represents a marginal reapportionment of the world’s manufacturing capacity amid recognition of hazards — from geopolitical realignments to the intensifying challenges of climate change.
“It’s not about deglobalization,” said Michael Burns, managing partner at Murray Hill Group, an investment firm focused on the supply chain. “It’s the next stage of globalization that is focused on regional networks.”
That Mexico looms as a potential means of cushioning Americans from the pitfalls of globalization amounts to a development rich in historical irony.
Three decades ago, Ross Perot, a business magnate then running for president, warned of “a giant sucking sound going south” in depicting Mexico as a threat to American livelihoods.
“The reality is that Mexico is the solution to some of our challenges,” said Shannon O’Neil, a Latin America specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “Trade that is closer by from Canada or Mexico is much more likely to create and protect U.S. jobs.”
Given that the United States, Mexico and Canada operate within an expansive trade zone, their supply chains are often intertwined. Each contributes parts and raw materials used in finished goods by the others. Cars assembled in Mexico, for example, draw heavily on parts produced at factories in the United States.
Overall, about 40% of the value of Mexico’s exports to America consist of components made at American plants, according to a seminal research paper. Yet only 4% of imports from China are American-made.
A Walmart representative described the company’s interest in Mexico as part of an effort to make its supply chain less vulnerable to troubles in any one region.
For now, Mexico lacks the capacity to assume China’s place as the dominant supplier of a vast range of goods.
At Preslow’s factory, about 50 miles north of Mexico City, 200 seamstresses leaned over clattering sewing machines on a recent morning, stitching garments amid the strains of Mexican folk music. Local designers sat in front of computer screens, conjuring new creations.
Yet the storage shelves were piled with bolts of synthetic fabric, nearly all of it made in China.
“All the basic materials are still imported from China, because you don’t have the suppliers here,” Presburger said. “The fabrics I use are impossible to get in Mexico.”
Closer to Home
In a bedroom community north of Dallas, Jose and Veronica Justiniano were also dependent on vital goods from Asia and eager to find a vendor in the same hemisphere.
The couple ran a small business, Veronica’s Embroidery, out of their home. They supplied restaurants, construction companies and maid services with uniforms for their employees.
Born and raised in El Salvador, they had left behind a horrific civil war to forge comfortable lives in the United States.
Jose Justiniano, 50, landed first in Los Angeles, where he worked as a janitor at the Beverly Hills jail and then as a billboard installer. After moving to Dallas, he got a job at an auto-parts plant and eventually rose to supervisor, gaining expertise in machinery. Veronica Justiniano, 54, worked as a home aide to an aging couple.
In 2018, the couple bought their first embroidery machine, installing it in an upstairs bedroom. The next year, they secured their most important customer — Gloria’s Latin Cuisine, a chain of 22 fine-dining restaurants in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin.
The Justinianos bought uniforms from a company that imported them from Asia. Then they used their machines to embroider the logos.
Their distributor maintained huge stocks of inventory at warehouses in Texas, typically delivering within a day. But as the pandemic intensified in 2020, days turned into months. The Justinianos were late in their own deliveries, a mortifying threat to their business.
Jose Justiniano hurriedly sought another supplier.
“The only way was Mexico,” he said.
They eventually entrusted much of their business to Lazzar Uniforms, a family-run company in Guadalajara, a booming city about 350 miles northwest of Mexico’s capital. Lazzar’s commercial director, Ramon Becerra, 39, was eager to gain a crack at the enormous market to the north.
“We know the U.S. is the future for us,” Becerra said.
The Justinianos’ American distributor operated in bulk, selling only what it had in stock and providing no custom work. Lazzar, on the other hand, beckoned as a design shop and apparel factory in one.
Becerra’s team conferred on the particulars of what the Justinianos desired: a light fabric that vented away moisture, providing relief from the heat of the kitchen. The two companies were able to communicate easily by phone and video without having to navigate a time difference.
They started small, with a few dozen chef’s jackets. By September 2021, Veronica’s Embroidery was purchasing 1,000 linen shirts in a single order, at prices close to what its previous distributor charged for imports from Asia.
On a recent morning, Becerra hosted Jose Justiniano at his factory in Guadalajara. The two men discussed a potential new partnership in which Lazzar would set up a warehouse in Texas, with Justiniano handling American distribution.
“This year has been a wake-up call for the U.S.,” Justiniano said. “We have to reconsider where we get our stuff made.”
A Troubled Legacy
The biggest impediment to Mexico’s reaching its potential as an alternative to China may be Mexico itself.
Its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has neglected the nation’s infrastructure, including its ports.
Even Presburger, an enthusiastic promoter of his country’s industrial virtues, concedes that Mexico will struggle to amass the scope of China’s manufacturing capacity.
He recalled his first trip to China to look for fabric more than a decade ago. The scope of production left him astonished, with monumental spinning mills alongside specialized dying operations.
“The sheer size of the factories there is crazy,” he said. “I don’t think there’s a way back from that. It’s not going to be easy.”
Inside his factory, he displayed a popular item, a black bomber jacket adorned with an elaborate and colorful pattern. The zipper was made in Mexico, as was a skull-shaped ornament that pulled it. But the rest of the components — the fabric, the thread, the liner — were all made across the Pacific.
Still, a shift is palpable.
Near Preslow’s plant, an enormous factory makes as many as 6 million buttons per day, employing about 1,500 people. The company, Botones Loren, has seen its sales grow by nearly two-thirds over the past year. Its customers — international brands such as Armani and Men’s Warehouse — are shifting orders from China, said CEO Sony Chalouah.
“They think that the U.S. will continue to be fighting with China,” he said. “They want to not depend on China.”
The Geopolitical Realignment
Some within the apparel industry anticipate that Mexico’s appeal will fade as normalcy returns to the global supply chain.
Shipping prices have sharply declined over the past year. China has begun loosening COVID-19 restrictions. Chinese apparel makers are aggressively courting business by offering steep discounts, according to Bernardo Samper, a longtime New York sourcing agent.
“At the end of the day, everything is driven by pricing,” he said.
Yet within Mexico, businesses are counting on continuing acrimony between the United States and China.
The Trump administration imposed steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports. President Joe Biden has continued that policy, while adding measures that seek to deny China access to technology.
Washington has accused the Chinese government of genocide in its brutal repression of the minority Uyghur community in the western Xinjiang region — a major source of cotton. Any company buying clothing made in China risks accusations of exploiting Uyghur forced labor.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its deepening ties with China have amplified the sense that the world is dividing into distinct camps of allies and enemies.
Companies need reliable supply chains.
Lectra, a French company that makes machines that cut fabric into pieces for the apparel industry, has seen its sales in Mexico and Central America grow by nearly one-third over the past year.
“What is driving this near-shoring is basically the situation between the U.S. and China,” said the company’s commercial director for the region, Carlos Sarmiento.
“It’s not that China is going to disappear from the American market,” he added. “It’s that there is more openness to look at Mexico and Central America as an alternative rather than depend entirely on China.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: PARIS -- So that's the end of that. With the deaths of Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Marie Straub this year, the curtain has come down on two of the most radical filmmakers of the 20th century. In their wake, a great era of European cinema has drawn to a close.
Their unclassifiable films interrogated the nature of image-making past and present, encompassing a whole sweep of historical, philosophical and musical references. While Mr. Godard remained famous, largely thanks to his early 1960s features that are among world cinema's most recognized classics, Mr. Straub and his partner Danièle Huillet's films were barely seen, though consistently championed by art house filmgoers. What these directors gave us, in their different but extreme works, were among the deepest reflections of what cinema was and can be.
They leave European cinema, buffeted by the pandemic, in a parlous state. Attendance numbers across the continent are in decline, the range of films is diminishing, and ticket prices are rising. Streaming platforms, which offer a model for movie watching that is cheaper, simpler and often more comfortable than a trip out to the movie theater, are generally held responsible for this state of affairs. While a reprise of a common argument that technological innovation -- from the emergence of sound to television -- would bring the demise of cinema, the charge has plenty of ammunition. The ubiquity of readily accessible movies and television series has undeniably dented the willingness of people to seek out more challenging films.
And yet, to judge from the array of films released this year, there's nothing wrong with the quality of European filmmaking. Often I emerged from a movie theater surprised, moved, disturbed and encouraged. Cinema may be threatened by changing habits of consumption, underfunding for nonblockbuster fare, narrow aesthetic codes and limited exposure, but it continues -- more than 100 years after the Lumière brothers pronounced the form's imminent death -- to thrum with life.
Much of that vitality emerges from the work of female directors. "One Fine Morning," by the French director Mia Hansen-Løve, is certainly up there with her best, bringing together all the admirable qualities of her filmmaking -- quiet emotional drama, subtle observation of human interaction and character evolution, stories rooted in cities and spaces -- in a simple tale of one woman's new relationship developing in parallel with her aging father's mental decline.
Germany's Angela Schanelec also added a fine, beguiling film to her already impressive filmography. "I Was at Home, But" tells the story, through a series of domestic scenes from a charming dance routine to negotiations over a defective bike, of a mother's complicated response to her son's return home after a weeklong absence. Originally released in 2019, the film -- delayed by the pandemic, like many others -- went on general release in French cinemas only in 2022.
The year also saw the continued flourishing of working-class films, or proletkino, a genre born in the Soviet Union of the 1920s. The proletariat was far more empowered than it is today in postindustrial Europe, yet in recent decades there has been an impressive and surprising resurgence of films in this genre across the continent. This new proletkino, as I've called it, had another bumper year.
The Dardenne brothers, Belgian filmmakers who have made a career out of social dramas set in an old steel town, produced one of their strongest -- and bleakest -- films to date, "Tori and Lokita," about two child migrants from Benin landing in France and the new hell they enter when one of them cannot get the required papers. Pedro Costa, a Portuguese auteur, also returned to his long-running subject of Cape Verde migrants in the Lisbon slums with his painterly and poetic "Vitalina Varela."
In France, Stéphane Brizé concluded his superb trilogy of films reflecting on the modern world of labor. In "Another World," he focuses on the pressures felt by a middle manager, once close to his workers but now forced to deliver on increasingly impossible demands for greater efficiency and enforce massive layoffs. As a chronicle of the changing nature of work in the past few decades, there's little better than Mr. Brizé's trilogy.
It's been a fine year for feature documentaries, too, including Jonàs Trueba's ambitious "Who's Stopping Us." Across five years and in more than three hours, the film charts the lives of young people in Madrid as they transition from their teens to their 20s. It continues an intriguing lineage of recent works mixing documentary and fiction that has its roots in Michael Apted's classic British TV series "Seven Up!," which began in 1964, and includes Richard Linklater's "Boyhood" (2014) and Sébastien Lifshitz's "Adolescents" (2019). In their marriage of sociological interest with formal experimentation, films like Mr. Trueba's offer an exciting new route for documentary cinema, exploring and expanding the possibilities of the form.
Perhaps no one better exemplifies that blending of reality and fiction than Alice Diop, the French documentarian whose first feature film, "Saint Omer," is on the Oscar shortlist for best international film. The courthouse drama, based on the true story of an infanticide, deserves its recognition -- and so does Ms. Diop, whose documentary "We," released in cinemas earlier in the year, insightfully and sensitively brings to light the experience of second- and third-generation immigrants in suburban France.
Adieu, then, Mr. Godard and Mr. Straub. The world of cinema has lost two titans. Beyond the loss, there are major reasons for concern, especially about distribution -- which relegates ever fewer films to limited runs in exclusive locations -- and a lack of cinema education that ideally would start in school. Mr. Godard, in particular, was a wonderful guide here: His films are a lesson in the history of cinema. There is currently no pretender to his throne in the 21st century. But we still have time. For now, a few new ghosts have joined us in the auditorium.

Made in China? U.S. Companies Shift to Mexico.: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: As American companies recalibrate the risks of relying on Chinese factories to make their goods, some are shifting business to a country far closer to home: Mexico.
The unfolding trend known as "near-shoring" has drawn the attention of no less than Walmart, the global retail empire with headquarters in Arkansas.
Early last year, when Walmart needed $ 1 million of company uniforms -- more than 50,000 in one order -- it bought them not from its usual suppliers in China but from Preslow, a family-run apparel business in Mexico.
It was February 2022, and the contours of global trade seemed up for alteration. The worst pandemic in a century had upended shipping. The cost of transporting products across the Pacific had skyrocketed, and ports were choked with floating traffic jams -- a stark indication of the dangers of depending on a single faraway country for critical goods.
Among multinational companies, decades of faith in the economic merits of making things in China had come under withering challenge, especially as animosity intensified between Washington and Beijing.
At his office in Mexico City, Isaac Presburger, director of sales at Preslow, took Walmart's order as a sign of his country's evolving role in the economy, and the opportunities that flow from sharing the same side of the Pacific with the United States.
"Walmart had a big problem with their supply," Mr. Presburger recounted. "They said, 'OK, Mexico, save me."'
Basic geography is a driver for American companies moving business to Mexico. Shipping a container full of goods to the United States from China generally requires a month -- a time frame that doubled and tripled during the worst disruptions of the pandemic. Yet factories in Mexico and retailers in the United States can be bridged within two weeks.
"Everybody who sources from China understands that there's no way to get around that Pacific Ocean -- there's no technology for that," said Raine Mahdi, founder of Zipfox, a San Diego-based company that links factories in Mexico with American companies seeking alternatives to Asia. "There's always this push from customers: 'Can you get it here faster?"'
During the first 10 months of last year, Mexico exported $ 382 billion of goods to the United States, an increase of more than 20 percent over the same period in 2021, according to U.S. census data. Since 2019, American imports of Mexican goods have swelled by more than one-fourth.
In 2021, American investors put more money into Mexico -- buying companies and financing projects -- than into China, according to an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute.
China will almost certainly remain a central component of manufacturing for years to come, say trade experts. But the shift toward Mexico represents a marginal reapportionment of the world's manufacturing capacity amid recognition of volatile hazards -- from geopolitical realignments to the intensifying challenges of climate change.
"It's not about deglobalization," said Michael Burns, managing partner at Murray Hill Group, an investment firm focused on the supply chain. "It's the next stage of globalization that is focused on regional networks."
That Mexico looms as a potential means of cushioning Americans from the pitfalls of globalization amounts to a development rich in historical irony.
Three decades ago, Ross Perot, the business magnate then running for president, warned of "a giant sucking sound going south" in depicting Mexico as a job-capturing threat to American livelihoods.
"The reality is that Mexico is the solution to some of our challenges," said Shannon K. O'Neil, a Latin America specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. "Trade that is closer by from Canada or Mexico is much more likely to create and protect U.S. jobs."
Given that the United States, Mexico and Canada operate within an expansive trade zone, their supply chains are often intertwined. Each contributes parts and raw materials used in finished goods by the others. Cars assembled in Mexico, for example, draw heavily on parts produced at factories in the United States.
Overall, some 40 percent of the value of Mexico's exports to the United States consists of parts and components made at American plants, according to a seminal research paper. Yet only 4 percent of imports from China are American-made.
A Walmart spokesperson described the company's interest in Mexico as part of a broader effort to make its supply chain less vulnerable to troubles in any one region.
For now, Mexico lacks the capacity to assume China's place as the dominant supplier of a vast range of goods.
At Preslow's factory some 50 miles north of Mexico City, 200 seamstresses leaned over clattering sewing machines on a recent morning, stitching garments amid the strains of Mexican folk music. Local designers sat in front of computer screens, conjuring new creations.
Yet the storage shelves were piled high with bolts of synthetic fabric, nearly all of it made in China.
"All the basic materials are still imported from China, because you don't have the suppliers here," Mr. Presburger said. "The fabrics I use are impossible to get in Mexico."
Closer to Home
On the other side of the Mexican border, in a bedroom community north of Dallas, Jose and Veronica Justiniano were also dependent on vital goods from Asia and eager to find a vendor in the same hemisphere.
The couple ran a small business, Veronica's Embroidery, out of their home. They supplied restaurants, construction companies and maid services with uniforms for their employees.
Born and raised in El Salvador, they had left behind a horrific civil war to forge comfortable lives in the United States.
Mr. Justiniano, 50, landed first in Los Angeles, where he worked as a janitor at the Beverly Hills jail, and then as a billboard installer. After moving to Dallas, he got an entry-level job at an auto parts plant, and eventually rose to supervisor, gaining expertise in machinery. Ms. Justiniano, 54, worked as a home aide to an aging couple.
In 2018, the couple bought their first embroidery machine, installing it in an upstairs bedroom. The next year, they secured their most important customer -- Gloria's Latin Cuisine, a chain of 22 fine-dining restaurants in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin.
The Justinianos bought uniforms from a company that imported them from Asia. Then they used their machines to embroider the logos.
Their distributor maintained huge stocks of inventory at warehouses in Texas, typically delivering within a day. But as the pandemic intensified in 2020, days turned into months. The Justinianos were late in their own deliveries, a mortifying threat to their business.
Mr. Justiniano hurriedly sought another supplier.
"The only way was Mexico," he said.
They eventually entrusted much of their business to Lazzar Uniforms, a family-run company in Guadalajara, a booming city about 350 miles northwest of Mexico's capital. Lazzar's commercial director, Ramon Becerra, 39, was eager to gain a crack at the enormous market to the north.
"We know the U.S. is the future for us," Mr. Becerrra said.
The Justinianos' American distributor operated in bulk, selling only what it had in stock and providing no custom work. Lazzar, on the other hand, beckoned as a design shop and apparel factory in one.
Mr. Becerra's team conferred on the particulars of what the Justinianos desired: a light fabric that vented away moisture, providing relief from the heat of the kitchen. The two companies were able to communicate easily by phone and video without having to navigate a time difference.
They started small, with a few dozen chef's jackets. By September 2021, Veronica's Embroidery was purchasing 1,000 linen shirts in a single order, at prices close to what its previous distributor charged for imports from Asia.
On a recent morning, Mr. Becerra hosted Mr. Justiniano at his factory in Guadalajara. The two men discussed a potential new partnership in which Lazzar would set up a warehouse in Texas, with Mr. Justiniano handling American distribution.
"This year has been a wake up call for the U.S.," Mr. Justiniano said. "We have to reconsider where we get our stuff made."
A Troubled Legacy
The biggest impediment to Mexico's reaching its potential as an alternative to China may be Mexico itself.
Its president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has neglected the nation's infrastructure, including its ports.
Even Mr. Presburger, an enthusiastic promoter of his country's industrial virtues, concedes that Mexico will struggle to amass the scope of China's manufacturing capacity.
He recalled his first trip to China to look for fabric more than a decade ago. The scope of production left him astonished, with monumental spinning mills alongside specialized dying operations.
"The sheer size of the factories there is crazy," he said. "I don't think there's a way back from that. It's not going to be easy."
Inside his factory, he displayed a popular item, a black bomber jacket adorned with an elaborate and colorful pattern. The zipper was made in Mexico, and so was a skull-shaped ornament that pulled it. But the rest of the components -- the fabric, the thread, the liner -- were all made across the Pacific.
Still, a shift is palpable.
Near Preslow's plant, an enormous factory makes as many as six million buttons per day, employing some 1,500 people. The company, Botones Loren, has seen its sales grow by nearly two-thirds over the past year. Its customers -- international brands like Armani and Men's Warehouse -- are shifting orders from China, said the company's chief executive, Sony Chalouah.
"They think that the U.S. will continue to be fighting with China," he said. "They want to not depend on China."
The Geopolitical Realignment
Some within the apparel industry anticipate that Mexico's appeal will fade as normalcy returns to the global supply chain.
Shipping prices have sharply declined over the past year. China has begun loosening Covid restrictions. Chinese apparel makers are aggressively courting business by offering steep discounts, according to Bernardo Samper, a longtime New York sourcing agent.
"At the end of the day, everything is driven by pricing," he said.
Yet within Mexico, businesses are counting on continuing acrimony between the United States and China.
The Trump administration imposed steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese imports. President Biden has continued that policy, while adding measures that seek to deny China access to technology.
Washington has accused the Chinese government of genocide in its brutal repression of the minority Uyghur community in the western Xinjiang region -- a major source of cotton. Any company buying clothing made in China risks accusations of exploiting Uyghur forced labor.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its deepening ties with China have amplified the sense that the world is dividing into distinct camps of allies and enemies.
Companies need reliable supply chains.
Lectra, a French company that makes machines that cut fabric into pieces for the apparel industry, has seen its sales in Mexico and Central America grow by nearly a third over the past year.
"What is driving this near-shoring is basically the situation between the U.S. and China," said the company's commercial director for the region, Carlos Sarmiento.
"It's not that China is going to disappear from the American market," he added. "It's that there is more openness to look at Mexico and Central America as an alternative rather than depend entirely on China."
