Full text: To the Editor:
Re "5 Takeaways From Another Trump-Free Republican Debate" (nytimes.com, Sept. 28):
Turn off the mic!
Seven people onstage at the same time. Just enough time for the evening's bloviators to spew out their prefabricated talking points. Not enough time for discussions of substance.
And then there's something called rules. In lieu of decorum, our debates have devolved into two hours of rudeness, interruption and incivility. Year after year, moderators exhibit little control or are completely ignored. Candidates with the least to say won't shut up, and those with a cogent thought don't have time to express it.
Suggestion: With a clearly displayed clock, give each candidate a prescribed amount of time for talk and rebuttal. If another candidate interrupts, turn off his or her mike. For further interruptions, deduct minutes from that candidate's talking time.
Would candidates be receptive to such an idea? If not, why?

To the Editor:
The smartest man on the G.O.P. debate stage was Donald Trump. He was omnipresent without the necessity of actual presence.
Why would he debate? He has the nomination wrapped up. The taunts ("Donald Trump is missing in action" -- Ron DeSantis; "Voters deserve to hear him defend his record"-- The Wall Street Journal) are futile rhetoric. Mr. Trump will not be provoked. He can continue to go about his business unscathed while watching his frenzied rivals with minuscule ratings continue to flail.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump gets to skate into the nomination on his terms thanks to a Republican Party that can't get enough of him. As Mr. Trump himself used to tweet, "Sad."

To the Editor:
I'm a very proud, lifelong Democrat. But I like to watch the G.O.P. debate because I enjoy seeing the party implode and eat its own. But I stopped after 45 minutes.
It was simply a bunch of lies, misleading statements and prepared applause lines. Not one of them has any idea how to solve America's problems, nor do they even offer a sensible plan, or in many cases any plan, to do so.
The party will simply anoint the twice-impeached, criminally indicted former POTUS. This is what the party wants, and, in short, nothing and no one will stop this from happening. We are all watching, in slow motion, the game play out before the final out.

Members of Congress, Still Paid in a Shutdown
To the Editor:
How is it that if there is a government shutdown, others suffer and go hungry but members of Congress still get paid? That is obviously wrong and needs to change.

Two Views of Justice
To the Editor:
Re "More Democrats Calling on Menendez to Resign" (front page, Sept. 27):
Senator Robert Menendez is indicted by the Justice Department. Democratic lawmakers across the country call for him to resign.
Donald Trump is indicted by the Justice Department. Republican lawmakers across the country call for investigations into the weaponization of the Justice Department.
Can there be a clearer indication of which group has a higher regard for ethics, morality and the rule of law?

Columbia's Contributions to New York City
To the Editor:
Re "Columbia and N.Y.U. Expand, but Pay Little Tax" (front page, Sept. 27):
Columbia is honored to call New York home, and we are committed to being a responsible and engaged citizen of this city. While we don't profess to be perfect, we take pride in the estimated $ 14.6 billion we contribute in annual economic impact to our community, according to the most recent study by New York's Commission on Independent Colleges & Universities.
But whittling down the university's local contributions to dollars spent ignores the broad array of commitments, large and small, that we have made to this city as one of its oldest and proudest institutional residents.
I could point to the critical role played by the university and our health care providers throughout the pandemic, including providing space and logistical support to house health care workers, or to researchers at our Climate School, who are contributing their time and resources to studying harmful algae blooms in city parks.
Most recently, our faculty and students have volunteered to help asylum seekers who are filing applications for the authorization to work.
Columbia is expanding our commitments to the city. That includes doing more to recruit, admit and support New York City's public school students.
We know this is an all-hands-on-deck moment for New York City, and we are dedicated to contributing in every way we can to assure a bright future for it.

High-Quality TV Shows
To the Editor:
Re "The Era of Prestige TV Is Ending. We're Going to Miss It When It's Gone," by Roy Price (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Sept. 21):
Before Netflix, before Amazon, before HBO, before any of the streamers, was "prestige" content from public broadcasting worldwide. And before that was "Playhouse 90" and other prestige content from the networks of television's early years.
Good content is not just produced by big distributors; look at the range of truly interesting shows that media creators are developing on easily accessible platforms that don't demand big budgets and fancy pedigrees.
Open your eyes beyond your narrow West Coast view, Mr. Price. There's a lot to like out there.

'I Love Dogs,' but Biden's Must Go
To the Editor:
Re "Once Again, a Biden Dog Gives a Bite to an Agent" (news article, Sept. 27):
I love dogs more than I love most humans. That said, I feel it's long past time that Commander, President Biden's German shepherd, is permanently exiled from the White House to a comfortable, safe environment, such as a farm, where he has fewer opportunities to bite people.
I doubt that Mr. Biden wants this outcome, but a dog with his record of biting folks should have been sent away long ago.

Mixed Reality Is Here. So Now What?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The new $ 500 headset lets people see the outside world while immersed in virtual reality. The benefits are to be determined.
Last week, I spent several hours trying Meta's latest goggles, the Quest 3. They ship next month. The headset runs virtual reality games with a novel twist: While shooting a blaster gun, snatching bats from midair and controlling a robot, I could see the real world through built-in cameras.
This is what Meta and its new rival, Apple, which recently unveiled the $ 3,500 Vision Pro headset, call "mixed reality" or "spatial computing," interchangeable terms to describe computers that blend digital data with the physical world.
These immersive computers, the companies say, could eventually become indispensable tools that change the way we live. Imagine reading a holographic recipe in the corner of your eye while cooking, for example, or staring at furniture parts with digital assembly instructions overlaid on them.
But for now, the devices are primarily used for playing games, and killer apps have yet to surface.
Meta's $ 500 Quest 3 headset, arriving in stores on Oct. 10 (pre-orders start on Wednesday), has sharper graphics than its predecessor, the Quest 2, which costs $ 200 less. Its marquee new feature is a set of high-resolution, "pass-through" cameras for seeing the outside world in color. They are a big improvement from the Quest 2's weaker camera system, which rendered a muddy monochrome picture.
After a two-hour session playing with the Quest 3, I removed the goggles and asked Meta employees the $ 10 billion question (that's the amount the company invests annually in V.R. technology) about mixed reality: What's the point?
Meta's answer to that is vague. The ability to simultaneously interact with virtual and physical space, the company said, would make it easier for people to feel connected to one another while wearing goggles. That could eventually be useful for collaborating on work tasks. What kind of work? Those apps are actively in development, a Meta spokesman told me.
To market the Quest 3, Meta highlighted mixed reality games. In First Encounters, a space game, I used a blaster gun to shoot a virtual wall, removing pieces of it brick by brick to see into the real world.
In Stranger Things VR, a game based on the popular Netflix series, I took on the role of the show's antagonist with telepathic powers. I could see virtual cracks embedded into the physical room surrounding me; when I pointed at the cracks and spread my fingers outward to open them up, bats flew out of the chasms. I grabbed them to squish them dead.
In Bam!, I could see other Quest 3 wearers in the room while we controlled miniature robots that battled each other inside a virtual arena. Each player could see a virtual platform containing the arena and adjust it to be level with the physical tabletop in front of them. The game was fun, but seeing others flail around their motion controllers while donning the geeky goggles didn't improve the game (though it certainly made me feel more self-conscious).
The experience of socializing with others while playing games reminded me of the LAN (local area network) parties of the 1990s, when gamers carried bulky computers to one another's homes to play together. It was a type of social gathering that feels antiquated now that internet speeds are zippy enough for us to play games online from our own homes.
Some mixed-reality app developers I later interviewed offered more clarity than Meta about the benefits of the technology. Naer is a start-up working on a mixed-reality app for office workers to brainstorm ideas on virtual white boards and sticky notes. Developers there said that being able to see into the real world while juggling virtual tasks would make the experience less jarring for professionals to wear headsets while working alongside colleagues in an office.
"When you're fully closed off and somebody taps your shoulder, it's very uncomfortable," said Sondre Kvam, a founder of the company, which is based in Norway. "But when you're using mixed reality, you're still a very much part of the real world -- you're no longer surprised."
Peeking into the outside world might also make V.R. gaming more comfortable. Tommy Palm, the chief executive of Resolution Games, said that in mixed reality, gamers would probably feel more confident playing games that involved fast movement.
In his game Blaston, where players shoot guns at each other in a virtual arena, people can crouch to avoid digital projectiles. Being able to see around you would help prevent collisions with objects in the room like furniture, he said.
Those examples of mixed reality sound convincing. But after spending a few hours with the Quest 3, I got the impression that the outward-facing cameras won't solve virtual reality's most nagging problems with comfort, which will prevent it from becoming a mainstream hit.
Weighing about a pound, the headset felt heavy on my head after about 15 minutes, causing neck strain. The graphics were bright and intense on the eyes. Bending over, twisting around and swinging my arms eventually felt exhausting.
So the Quest 3 may be a fun toy to entertain house guests, but most gamers looking for a social experience will probably prefer the old-fashioned setup of sitting on their couch with a game controller.

Actors Await Breakthrough As Writers Return to Work: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The leadership of the Writers Guild of America voted to end a 148-day strike. Members will start voting on the deal's ratification next week.
After 148 days on strike, television and movie writers will begin returning to work on Wednesday.
The Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,500 screenwriters, said on Tuesday that three internal boards had voted unanimously to end the strike and send a tentative contract with entertainment companies to members for ratification. The vote will start on Monday and end on Oct. 9.
Members are expected to approve the three-year deal.
"Our negotiators knew the kind of deal they had to deliver -- anything less than exceptional was not going to fly with a membership that has become younger, more active, possibly more radical," said Bryce Schramm, a writer whose credits include the CW's "Dynasty" and Disney's "Runaways."
The Writers Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, reached the tentative agreement on Sunday after a bitter standoff that contributed to a near-complete shutdown of film and television production. Guild leaders have repeatedly called the terms of the accord "exceptional." Studios have declined to comment.
For the first time, the Writers Guild made those terms public on Tuesday. While not receiving everything it asked for, the union achieved major gains.
Residual payments (a form of royalty) for overseas viewing of streaming would increase 76 percent, according to the union. Netflix's foreign residual, for instance, would total $ 32,830 for a one-hour episode over three years, up from $ 18,684.
For the first time, writers will receive a bonus from streaming services that is based on a percentage of active subscribers. The guild had demanded that entertainment companies establish a viewership-based bonus to reward programs that become hits.
On the contentious issue of minimum staffing for television shows, at least three writer-producers must be hired for writers' rooms for first-season shows running 20 weeks or longer. Minimum staffing for additional seasons will be tied to the number of episodes.
Studios had initially refused to negotiate at all on the guild's demand for minimum staffing, calling it "a hiring quota that is incompatible with the creative nature of our industry." The Writers Guild had been seeking a minimum of six writers.
The Writers Guild said the tentative contract includes enhancements worth an estimated $ 233 million annually. When bargaining started in the spring, the guild proposed $ 429 million in enhancements, while studios countered with $ 86 million, according to the guild.
The tentative contract also contains guarantees that artificial intelligence technology will not encroach on writers' credits and compensation. Studios cannot use A.I. tools to rewrite original material. Writers, however, can use the technology for assistance if the company they are working for allows it; studios cannot force them to use it.
In a concession by the union, studios will be able to use film and TV scripts that they already own to refine A.I. tools and experiment.
During negotiations in April before the strike, studios refused to engage on the topic of artificial intelligence, saying too much was unknown about the technology. They said the guild would have to wait until contract negotiations in 2026. Studio leaders have since called their early refusal to negotiate on the issue an error. It was one of the reasons the guild called a strike.
Even though writers' rooms can begin running again, much of Hollywood will stay at a standstill: Tens of thousands of actors remain on strike, and no talks between the actors' union, SAG-AFTRA, and the studios have been scheduled.
The only productions that could quickly restart are ones without actors, like late-night shows hosted by Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert and daytime talk shows hosted by Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Hudson.
In addition to actors, more than 100,000 behind-the-scenes workers (directors, camera operators, publicists, makeup artists, prop makers, set dressers, lighting technicians, hairstylists, cinematographers) will continue to stand idle, many with mounting financial hardship. The impact extends beyond California and New York. There are production hubs in Georgia and New Mexico, for instance.
About $ 10 billion in TV and film production is on hold, according to ProdPro, a production tracking service. That equates to 176 shows and films.
While the Writers Guild suspended picketing on Sunday, the union encouraged members to join the actors' picket lines this week -- a symbolic show of solidarity before returning to work.
"Today is an important day to pay a debt to the actors who came out to support us early during our strike, when they still had a contract," Mr. Schramm, the writer, said on Tuesday as he arrived at Paramount Pictures with a picket sign. "It's also nice to gather with other writers and feel some ownership over our victory."
About 80 people were marching outside Paramount by midmorning. Roughly a third wore blue Writers Guild shirts. A smattering of people had donned sparkly tutus in honor of a "tutu Tuesdays" theme. Someone had brought a boom box, which was blaring "I'm Still Standing" by Elton John.
The comedic actor Jack Black ("Jumanji") carried a picket sign reading, "We Ain't Done Yet," while the Emmy-winning Bob Odenkirk ("Better Call Saul") sported a black SAG-AFTRA shirt.
The mood was buoyant, even euphoric.
"I can't imagine that it will be drawn out," Kari Nicolle, an actress whose credits include "CSI: Vegas," said about the negotiations that remain between her union and the studios. "If the writers were satisfied with the A.I. protections that studios offered, then hopefully SAG will be able to piggyback."

Gala to Accept Stars, But Not Studio Bosses: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: How will the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures put on its star-studded fund-raiser this year, amid the polarizing strike? Very carefully.
Meryl Streep, who was chosen to be honored at the gala next month for the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, was initially under the impression that the Hollywood actors' strike would prevent her from attending.
The strike, after all, had already forced the Academy to delay one gala in November, where Angela Bassett and Mel Brooks were to receive honorary Oscars. In the case of the fund-raising event planned for Oct. 14, it was unclear at first if SAG-AFTRA, the union representing TV and movie actors, would allow striking members to attend, and, if it did, whether any would want to go.
Would it be OK to appear at such a celebratory event while the industry is on the ropes? Should actors sit at tables (costing $ 250,000 to $ 500,000) that in some cases are paid for by the studios they are striking against? And what about the potential for vitriol and tension, or at least deep social awkwardness?
But after negotiations and quiet diplomacy that determined who could attend and what kinds of work could be honored, the gala -- which typically attracts Hollywood's A-listers and moguls and raises more than $ 10 million for the popular museum -- will proceed. The biggest change: Executives from the studios being struck, some of which are among the museum's biggest sponsors, will not be there.
Streep will be, though, since she has approval from her union. "I have been assured that SAG-AFTRA has encouraged members to attend the gala -- that the museum deeply depends on this event for its educational and community outreach, and that no industry executives from struck companies will be in attendance," she said in an email. "So I am steaming my dress and heading West."
Streep's initial confusion is emblematic of the fraught territory that the industry finds itself in as it tries to navigate the dos and don'ts of the strike -- from awards shows and fund-raisers to social events, films and television shows.
It can be confusing: Some talk show hosts have stumbled in trying to do decide whether to return to the air, and the writers' union picketed "Dancing With the Stars" although its cast had received a green light from SAG-AFTRA to work. The tentative deal reached Sunday by the Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers was a hopeful sign, but the actors remain on strike, and securing their union's blessing was crucial for the Academy gala.
"The basic guidance we've given people is, so long as it is not focused on a particular project or a particular struck company, it's OK for our members to participate in those events and to acknowledge someone's body of work," Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of the actors' union, said in an interview. "There will be members who choose not to participate in these things who don't feel it's the right thing to do at this point, since it is a serious time for people who work in the industry. I imagine our members will make judgments for themselves."
The gala is vital for the nascent museum, in an effort to raise millions of dollars and the institution's profile. The event's knack for drawing bold-faced names has led some to think of it as a West Coast Met Gala. The question this year is whether the lack of studio executives, and qualms on the part of striking actors, could make this year's party less buoyant or its red carpet less buzzy.
But assuming the honorees show up as planned, there will be guaranteed star power present: In addition to Streep, the Academy will honor Oprah Winfrey, Michael B. Jordan, and Sofia Coppola. The chairs of the gala, which is raising money for exhibitions, education and public programs, are the director Ava DuVernay, the actor Halle Berry, the producer Ryan Murphy and the producer Dr. Eric Esrailian, a physician and a trustee.
"This event is about raising vital funds to ensure that this work will go on in service to the public," said Jacqueline Stewart, who last year became the museum's director and president. "The work of the museum is a common ground despite the strikes."
Behind the scenes, union representatives have been in discussions with the museum to set certain ground rules: Individual actors can be honored, but not individual projects, and bodies of work can be highlighted, but not specific films, studios or streaming services. If the gala ventures out of bounds, Crabtree-Ireland said, members will be expected to get up and leave to avoid incurring disciplinary measures.
Stewart said that no guests had declined invitations citing the strike as a reason. While some studios have contributed funds to the gala, she said, "given the particular circumstances this year, there will be no executives from struck companies in attendance." The majority of table and ticket buyers are not from the studios, the museum said, but are a mix of corporate supporters, philanthropists, and museum trustees.
Some union members hope that the museum gala can be an opportunity to highlight the labor dispute, which was prompted by concerns about pay, artificial intelligence and working conditions and which has halted virtually all production.
"I get that the optics are bad when some of our members are walking the picket line and others are putting on black tie and jewels and walking the red carpet," said Greg Cope White, who had to pause production on a Netflix adaptation of his memoir -- for which he is also a screenwriter -- "The Pink Marine," about a gay 18-year-old who joins the U.S. Marine Corps.
"The gala is an opportunity to get some attention to our cause," White added. "Meryl Streep and Oprah are great speakers. Hopefully they'll give passionate sound bites that will bring some light to us."
Each honoree will receive a different award -- Streep, for her "global cultural impact"; Jordan for "helping to contextualize and challenge dominant narratives around cinema"; Winfrey for her "exemplary leadership and support" of the museum; and Coppola for innovations that "have advanced the art of cinema."
After numerous delays, the Academy Museum finally opened in 2021, a seven-story, $ 484 million concrete-and-glass spherical building designed by the architect Renzo Piano that was widely welcomed as an example of the city's cultural fertility. An exhibition dedicated to John Waters, the cult filmmaker who directed "Pink Flamingos," "Polyester" and "Hairspray," opened there on Sept. 17.
Although the gala is approaching fast, some actors and writers remain hopeful that the strike will be resolved by the time the limousines start to roll down Wilshire Boulevard. "If I could open the envelope at the Oscars," White said, "It would say, 'Strike is over."'

U.S. Sues Amazon, Saying It Stifles Rivals Illegally: [National Desk]

Full text: The Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued Amazon, saying its conduct in its online store and services to merchants illegally stifled competition.
The Federal Trade Commission and 17 states sued Amazon on Tuesday, setting up a long-awaited antitrust fight with the e-commerce giant that could alter the way Americans shop for everything from toilet paper to electronics online.
The 172-page suit, the federal government's most significant challenge to the power of the online store, accused Amazon of protecting a monopoly over swaths of online retail by squeezing merchants and favoring its own services.
For consumers, that meant "artificially higher prices" as merchants were blocked from selling their products for less on other sites, and a worse shopping experience as Amazon boosted its own products and peppered its search results with ads, the lawsuit said. The retailer's tactics made it impossible for its rivals to compete, the agency and states said.
"A single company, Amazon, has seized control over much of the online retail economy," said the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. "It exploits its monopolies in ways that enrich Amazon but harm its customers: both the tens of millions of American households who regularly shop on Amazon's online superstore and the hundreds of thousands of businesses who rely on Amazon to reach them."
The lawsuit put the influence and reach of Amazon, a $ 1.3 trillion behemoth, squarely in the spotlight after years of mounting scrutiny. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, the onetime upstart online bookseller has grown into a conglomerate with tentacles in retail, Hollywood and the foundational infrastructure of the internet.
Much of the Seattle-based company's power has emanated from its online marketplace, sometimes known as an "everything store" for the range of products it sells and the speed with which it delivers them. Amazon's sway over online commerce has shaped the lives of merchants around the world, set the working conditions for more than one million warehouse workers and pushed the Postal Service to deliver on Sundays.
Now Amazon, which denied the accusations in the lawsuit, has become the latest big tech company to face off against the government over monopoly concerns, just as the Justice Department entered the third week of an antitrust trial challenging Google over its power in online search. The F.T.C. has also brought an antitrust lawsuit against Meta, which owns Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. Members of Congress have considered legislation to regulate some of the companies' most common business practices.
The new lawsuit pits Amazon directly against Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, in a long-awaited confrontation. She rose to fame as a Yale law student in 2017 when she published a paper arguing that American antitrust laws had failed to adequately stop Amazon from amassing power over its customers, competitors and suppliers. The paper helped kick off a debate about whether U.S. antitrust laws needed to be modernized to rein in tech giants.
David Zapolsky, Amazon's general counsel, said in a statement that the F.T.C. "is wrong on the facts and the law" with the lawsuit, portions of which were heavily redacted. He said the complaint showed that the agency's "focus has radically departed from its mission of protecting consumers and competition."
"If the F.T.C. gets its way, the result would be fewer products to choose from, higher prices, slower deliveries for consumers and reduced options for small businesses -- the opposite of what antitrust law is designed to do," he added.
The F.T.C. asked the court to issue an injunction blocking Amazon from engaging in "unlawful conduct" and raised the possibility of altering the company's structure. But it stopped short of detailing how the court could clip Amazon's dominance, such as breaking apart elements of its business. The agency could become more specific if it succeeded in proving Amazon violated the law.
"If we succeed, competition will be restored and people will benefit from lower prices, greater quality, greater selection as a result," Ms. Khan said of the lawsuit.
In the lawsuit, the F.T.C. said Amazon abused a driver of sales known as the Buy Box -- the valuable space on its website and app that prompts customers to "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart."
If Amazon sees a product available for less elsewhere, it will remove those two buttons and replace them with less enticing language and designs to discourage discounts outside its site, the lawsuit said. The company recognized merchants' sales would "tank" if they lost the Buy Box, the lawsuit said. To survive, sellers kept prices high on other sites, it said.
The lawsuit argued that the company made it hard for merchants to sell across different sites by making them use Amazon's fulfillment and delivery services to be eligible for its Prime benefits, which have millions of subscribers.
Amazon, which generates more than $ 500 billion in annual revenue, has continued growing despite the scrutiny. In the past three years, it bought One Medical, a chain of primary care practices; the Roomba manufacturer iRobot; and the fabled movie studio Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, giving it a major stake in the James Bond franchise. These deals have added to an empire that includes its online superstore, cloud computing services that power wide areas of the web and a streaming service that competes with rivals like Netflix.
The F.T.C.'s competition team began investigating Amazon's business in summer 2019, with no shortage of complaints about the company's business practices from critics and rivals.
By June 2021, when President Biden appointed Ms. Khan to be the F.T.C.'s chair, Amazon had provided the agency with documents and information, a person familiar with the investigation said. Under Ms. Khan's leadership, a new team was formed to run the antitrust inquiry, the person said.
The relationship between Amazon and the F.T.C. has been strained since Ms. Khan took over the agency. Weeks after she was sworn in, Amazon petitioned the agency to have her recused from antitrust matters regarding the company.
Last year, Amazon moved to stop the agency from interviewing Mr. Bezos and Andy Jassy, the company's chief executive, in a separate investigation into its Prime membership practices, accusing the F.T.C. of "harassing" the executives. This June, the F.T.C. sued the company as a result of that investigation, accusing it of violating consumer protection laws by tricking consumers into signing up for its Prime membership program.
With Tuesday's announcement, the F.T.C. joins government agencies around the world that are trying to check Amazon's influence on the economy.
In 2021, the attorney general of the District of Columbia accused Amazon of controlling prices on its website, but a judge dismissed the case last year. A similar, but more robust, case brought by California overcame Amazon's attempt to have it thrown out.
The F.T.C.'s lawsuit also echoes accusations from European Union regulators that caused Amazon to change some of its practices. The company agreed last year to a settlement in Europe that will see it display offers from more merchants on individual product pages, and it earlier eliminated some contractual language that stopped merchants from discounting products elsewhere.
Amazon is also winding down most of its private label brands after they failed to generate substantial consumer traction, a person familiar with the strategy said. In June, it announced it would later this year reopen enrollment for a program that let merchants sell their products as Prime-eligible while handling the deliveries themselves, without using Amazon's warehouses.

As Young People Stream Away, Networks Bet on Boomer Taste: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This coming week, as the network fall television season gets underway, ABC will begin airing "The Golden Bachelor," a spinoff of "The Bachelor" that centers on an offbeat twist: The main contestant is a 72-year-old man, and the 22 women vying for his affection range in age from 60 to 75.
On Sunday nights, the network will carve out three hours for "The Wonderful World of Disney," a television tradition that dates back to the 1950s. On Tuesdays, there's "Dancing With the Stars." On Wednesdays, there will be special prime-time episodes of decades-old standbys like "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!"
It's no secret that network television ratings have plummeted in recent years as viewers have fled prime-time lineups in favor of stream-at-your-leisure outlets like Netflix and Hulu.
But there's one notable exception, a segment of the audience that has effectively become the broadcast networks' core constituency: people over 60.
The median age of viewers at ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox has ballooned in recent years. That has left executives looking for ways to acknowledge and nurture an audience that still reliably flips on the television and watches in prime time, the old-fashioned way.
"Boomers are keeping it afloat," Kevin Reilly, a veteran programming executive who held top jobs at Fox and NBC, said of network TV. The generation, he said, "grew up with organizing their worldview around it -- the TV was the center of the living room, and we watched day-and-date."
This is a critical time for the networks. They are a shell of what they used to be, and no longer the reliable hit factories and cultural forces of yesteryear.
Hollywood's writers' and actors' strikes have only made matters worse. The strikes have grounded production for months, forcing the networks to program a piecemeal lineup of reality series, sports, games shows and repeats for the next several months.
Entertainment executives are privately fretting about a ratings collapse -- not to mention further migration to streaming -- without the vital aid of new scripted original programs.
Just nine years ago, the median age of most top-rated network entertainment shows ranged from the mid-40s to early 50s -- it was 45 for the sitcom "How I Met Your Mother" and 52 for "The Big Bang Theory," according to Nielsen. Some shows, like "Brooklyn Nine-Nine," had a median viewer as young as 39.
But in the most recent network television season, which ended in May, the median viewer was older than 60 for most entertainment shows, including "The Voice" (64.8), "The Masked Singer" (60.6), "Grey's Anatomy" (64.1) and "Young Sheldon" ("65+," the highest range that Nielsen provides).
Local television stations have seen similar trends.
"There is a quite distinct generational divide for local broadcast viewing at the age of 45," according to a recent report from TVREV, a research group. "Generation X and boomers (those 45+) still cling to TV habits they developed as kids, while their kids largely reject local linear broadcast."
Executives said in interviews that the median age for many of these series was younger when their viewership was measured on the networks' affiliated streaming services like Hulu, Peacock and Paramount+. Some shows have median ages that are 20 or 25 years younger than they are on broadcast, they said. The ABC hit "Abbott Elementary," which has a viewer median age of 60.5 on broadcast, is also popular with younger viewers when it is streamed on Hulu.
Some executives also point out that younger viewers are not adequately measured by existing viewership tools.
"Anyone we're not capturing on a linear device we are capturing on streaming," said Radha Subramanyam, the chief research officer for CBS.
Still, she added: "At CBS, we love older viewers. They watch a lot of television. And advertisers love them because they have tons and tons of spending power."
Even so, advertisers still value television audiences under the age of 50. David Zaslav, the Warner Bros. Discovery chief executive, said this month that as much as 75 percent of the audience of his cable networks was over 54 and that, as a result, the company was not making as much as it could from advertising.
Dick Wolf, a leading purveyor of procedurals, one of television's classic genres, is a big presence for CBS's usual lineup ("FBI," "FBI: Most Wanted," "FBI: International") as well as NBC's ("Law & Order: SVU," "Chicago Med," "Chicago Fire," "Chicago P.D."). Last year, NBC brought the original "Law & Order" back to life, starring the 82-year-old Sam Waterston.
Other scripted series also come from an earlier time, including NBC's "Quantum Leap" and "Magnum, P.I." -- which, unlike most of the network's competitors, will have new episodes this season because they were taped before the strikes. CBS is resurrecting "Matlock," a show that "The Simpsons" used to lampoon for its older fan base. (The new version of "Matlock" will star Kathy Bates and appear after "60 Minutes," sometime after the strikes are resolved.)
Last year, NBC found a surprise hit in "Night Court," the sitcom that debuted nearly four decades ago. ("Night Court" and "Quantum Leap" first appeared on the same night on NBC's schedule in 1989.) A producer for "Night Court" said this year that the courtroom for the new show was "not filled with tons of computer screens or modern trappings of life -- we really intentionally wanted 'Night Court' to feel like a place a bit frozen in time."
At ABC, executives decided to move "The Golden Bachelor" to an 8 p.m. slot on Thursdays, after the network had originally slotted it for Mondays at 10 p.m. One of the reasons: broad enthusiasm for the show as well as a strong lead-in from "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!"
"We have an affiliate lead-in that has a median age around 67 or 68, which is smack dab in the middle of that traditional sort of definition of what a baby boomer is," said Ari Goldman, the senior vice president of content strategy and scheduling at ABC Entertainment. "We're going to be leaning into that abundance of audience that we have going into prime time."
And, of course, "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" will have their own night to shine, with special prime-time celebrity editions on Wednesdays.
"These are shows that have been staples for the older audience for four or five decades -- I think 'Jeopardy!' is even going to be hitting 60 years old in some form or another this coming year," Mr. Goldman said. "These are shows that our audience has grown up with, and they're comforting and sort of throwback programming for that audience."

More Actors Step Behind the Camera: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Movies directed by actors were prominent at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. Could the reasons they're striking also underlie the career move?
By my count, there are 10 movies by actor-turned-directors at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. Ten. The majority, including Chris Pine's "Poolman" and Anna Kendrick's "Woman of the Hour," are debuts.
I don't know how many actors choose to be filmmakers at any given moment; "what I really want to do is direct" is a cliché for a reason. But that still seems like a lot. And it is particularly noteworthy right now in Hollywood, when the strikes by the actors' union, SAG-AFTRA, and the Writers Guild of America have revealed how much disparity there can be in pay and in the ownership of one's work. Not to mention the willingness of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers to make a deal with the Directors Guild of America but not the other creatives.
"Actors directing films isn't unusual," said Cameron Bailey, the chief executive of the Toronto festival, "but we saw a larger number this year and invited several, before we got news of the strike." Besides the Kendrick and Pine movies, actors making directorial debuts included Patricia Arquette ("Gonzo Girl"), Kristin Scott Thomas ("North Star"), Kasia Smutniak ("Walls") and Finn Wolfhard and Billy Bryk ("Hell of a Summer").
Directing confers control, which confers power, which confers stability, right? At the very least, if you're directing, you're not left hanging around.
"Everyone is hanging around," Stacey Sher, one of the "Poolman" producers, told me. "You're hanging around to get financing. You're hanging around to get distribution. You're hanging around to hope that you get a date that connects. You're hanging around to hope that you get lucky and your campaign clicks and that you're in the zeitgeist. You're hanging around hoping that the press likes your movie." Sher has been producing films for more than 30 years, among them actor-director feature debuts like "Reality Bites" (Ben Stiller) and "Garden State" (Zach Braff).
In "Poolman," for which he also served as a producer and co-screenwriter, Pine plays a Lebowski-style free spirit who ministers a decrepit apartment-complex pool by day and disrupts local council meetings by night. As a director, Pine, who has been acting for two decades, suddenly found himself answering questions about everything around the clock. Sher recalled him telling her, "'I understand how easy I had it before, just being able to go back and study my lines and prepare and stay in character."'
Though Pine had planned to publicize "Poolman" at Toronto, his support of the strike precluded his attendance because SAG-AFTRA forbids promotions during the labor action. On opening night, Sher presented the film solo, stating: "It is a different premiere and Q. and A. then we had hoped for, but there was never a second where Chris was going to do anything but stand with SAG and the W.G.A."
Pine was returning the favor. He "knew what he wanted and what he wanted was to build a team that could support him in achieving what his goals were cinematically," Sher said. Patty Jenkins, who had directed the actor in the "Wonder Woman" franchise, was a "Poolman" producer from the start (Ian Gotler was also a producer). Jenkins acted as "directing doula," available for technical checks and gut checks, Sher said. Pine also worked with the "Wonder Woman" films' cinematographer, Matthew Jensen. Directing granted him the power to surround himself with people -- the kind who are currently striking -- who could make his new job easier.
"Poolman" was a low-budget film in which almost half of the 22 days was spent shooting in a motel where beds were removed to make way for makeshift offices and dressing rooms, adding to the camaraderie. "I think if you just want the job for control, you're not going to do a very good job," Sher said of directing. "The best filmmakers I've ever worked with are the most collaborative."
"Woman of the Hour" was an exercise in combining the right people in what Miri Yoon -- one of several producers on the project along with Kendrick -- likened to a kind of "math" problem. Kendrick, who was initially attached only to star, "really drove us over the line," said Yoon, who recently worked on another major actor-director feature, "Don't Worry Darling" from Olivia Wilde. It was the way Kendrick interpreted the Black List script by Ian McDonald -- a quasi-biopic about the 1970s serial killer Rodney Alcala told through the eyes of women who crossed his path, including a "Dating Game" contestant (Kendrick) -- that convinced everyone she should helm.
"We're like, well, what are we doing?" Yoon said. "Why do we even bother going through this whole dog-and-pony show trying to figure out who else can do this movie? Let's just go." From that moment, it went fast -- about six weeks after Kendrick was tapped to direct, the crew was in prep for a 24-day shoot -- and it went hard, with a Vancouver winter standing in for a Los Angeles summer. Despite all of this, the first-time filmmaker was very deliberate, Yoon said: "There's nothing arbitrary about Anna Kendrick."
I suggested that Kendrick's preparation might be due to the fact that she's a woman in the director's chair, with all the prejudices that entails. Yoon gestured that I had hit it on the nose. While almost half the actor-director films at Toronto are by women, everyone knows by now the challenges female filmmakers face behind the camera. As actress Eva Longoria recently told Variety upon the release of "Flamin' Hot," her feature directing debut, "I get one at-bat, one chance, work twice as hard, twice as fast, twice as cheap."
No doubt aware of this calculus, Kendrick herself announced she was "heartbroken" at not being able to attend the Toronto festival for the premiere because of SAG-AFTRA rules. While some independent films have secured interim agreements if they agree to union demands, this year's festival has seen few American filmmakers and actors doing promotion. Despite that, "Woman of the Hour" still landed the first major sale of the festival in a reported $ 11 million deal with Netflix.
Considering that the stability of Hollywood itself is in question, it is hard to determine whether directing confers more security than having to hang around waiting for an acting job. Neither of the producers I spoke to were able to give a definitive answer, with Yoon saying the industry was still finding its footing in "a landscape that is going through a seismic change."
Bailey, the Toronto festival chief, surmised that the lack of work around the Covid lockdowns led to an abundance of actors directing, an attempt to claim agency over their careers. "I suspect some of these actors used the opportunity of the pandemic disruption to get more personal projects made." Indeed both Pine and Kendrick have said separately that the pandemic led them to change the way they thought about their work.
Yoon did, however, agree that while producing seems to be more about business ownership, directing seems to be more about artistic ownership. She elaborated, "The film's end result is the sum of many, many, many parts, and the fact that you get to participate in all of those parts, which, as an actor, you don't necessarily do."
Still, Sher said she thought the reason anyone, including an actor, directs is incredibly personal. "I remember a filmmaker friend of mine said every filmmaker directs for a different value," Sher explained. "For some people, it's reality; for some people, it's about precision, some people performance, some people it's technical, some aesthetic pleasure. And the more people that are doing it, the more people also realize that it's an option that they may never have thought that they had."

Full text: Sasha DiGiulian, a world champion climber, and Erik Osterholm, an Emmy Award-winning producer, met while documenting her ice climb of New Hampshire's Mount Washington in 2017.
In late December 2017, Sasha Renata DiGiulian arrived in New Hampshire to ice climb Mount Washington, the highest peak in the Northeast, with Mark Synnott, a fellow professional climber. They were there to be filmed over three days and two nights for the pilot of a docuseries sponsored by Red Bull. Their episode, which took place amid snow and 120-mile-per-hour winds, was directed by Erik Hartel Osterholm, who was also an executive producer.
"We were supposed to start at 4 a.m. the next day," Mr. Osterholm said. "Sasha showed up at 11 p.m. or 12 a.m., a few hours before we had to wake up. I remember her bursting with energy, surprisingly, at midnight."
When filming wrapped, Ms. DiGiulian and Mr. Osterholm shared a car for a three-hour drive from Jackson, N.H., to Boston Logan International Airport. Ms. DiGiulian, now 30, and Mr. Osterholm, 37, each in a relationship at the time, got to know each other better by discussing topics ranging from family to Bitcoin.
Ms. DiGiulian flew home to Boulder, Colo., while Mr. Osterholm boarded a flight to Aspen, Colo., for a ski trip with friends before returning to Bozeman, Mont., where he had recently moved after eight years in New York. Ms. DiGiulian had moved from New York a year earlier, and, coincidentally, the two had lived near each other in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood and even belonged to the same Equinox gym, though they had never crossed paths.
In April 2018, the two met up at a coffee shop in Midtown Manhattan to discuss working together again. Ms. DiGiulian was in town for a gala, while Mr. Osterholm was visiting for meetings and work. Both were still in relationships; neither felt a romantic spark.
Two months later, on July 11, 2018, Ms. DiGiulian, was driving from Boulder to Banff National Park to climb the trilogy, three of Canada's most challenging big wall climbs in a single season. She stopped in Bozeman for the night. At 9 p.m., while out with friends at Plonk wine bar, Ms. DiGiulian invited Mr. Osterholm to join. Both were newly single.
He was getting ready for bed when he received her text message and quickly changed plans to go out. "We were having our own conversation in a swirl of other people talking," Mr. Osterholm said. He felt something romantic could be there.
The next day, Ms. DiGiulian realized she had feelings when the two met for a five-mile jog and hike on the M Trail in Bozeman, and grabbed lunch after. Not wanting to lose momentum, Mr. Osterholm had fibbed, telling Ms. DiGiulian that he had plans to visit her town when he did not.
The couple's first official date was six weeks later, on Aug. 24, 2018, for a weekend in Boulder, where they hiked, climbed and cycled, among other outdoor activities. Having gone on only a handful of dates before each departed for two months of work-related travel, they spoke frequently on the phone between late September and early November.
Mr. Osterholm invited Ms. DiGiulian to spend Thanksgiving in Bozeman with him and his mother, Anne Osterholm, a real estate agent in Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Ms. Osterholm was impressed by Ms. DiGiulian's hugs. "I have never been hugged as strongly and as firmly and for the longest period of time," she said.
The two women bonded while wearing aprons as they cooked a squash casserole, laughing and drinking wine. They brought the dish to a Thanksgiving dinner at a neighbor's home.
"I saw Sasha and Erik laughing and smiling," Ms. Osterholm said. "I know my son, and when his eyes are sparkling like that, it's rare. And it's magical."
As a professional climber, Ms. DiGiulian has achieved the title of the Female Overall World Champion and completed more than a dozen first ascents over all around the world. Her memoir, "Take The Lead: Hanging On, Letting Go and Conquering Life's Hardest Climbs," will be published on Sept. 26 by Macmillan Publishers.

Ms. DiGiulian, who has celiac disease, an autoimmune condition, is also a founder and the chief executive of Send Bars, a gluten-free, plant-based and vegan superfood nutrition bar company. Raised in Alexandria, Va., she graduated from Columbia with a bachelor's degree in nonfiction creative writing.
Mr. Osterholm grew up in Bethesda, Md. He earned a Primetime Emmy in 2015 for his production work on "Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown." For the series, he traveled with Mr. Bourdain to several places, including Iran and the South Pole. Mr. Osterholm has also worked on HBO's "Vice" series, Netflix's "The Business of Drugs" and CNN's "Nomad with Carlton McCoy." He has a bachelor's degree in television production from Emerson College.
In May 2019, Mr. Osterholm moved to Boulder, into a house with Ms. DiGiulian. The couple moved to another house in Boulder in September 2019. They have two cats, Pixie and Twix, and a bernedoodle, MooseChaga.
In early 2020, after almost two years of hip pain, an M.R.I. showed that Ms. DiGiulian had hip dysplasia. "I had shredded through all of the surrounding ligaments that were holding things into place within my pelvic bone," she said. The diagnosis called for double hip reconstructive surgery, which could potentially end her career.
After Ms. DiGiulian's "graphic and intense" surgery in April 2020, Mr. Osterholm says he was thrust into a new multifaceted caregiving role. "Deep into that process of helping carry Sasha to the bathroom, and hospital visits, and all that P.T. madness, and Covid all around, Sasha thought it was a really good idea to get a puppy," he said. Ms. DiGiulian fully recovered.
In the spring of 2021, the couple started talking about getting engaged. After finding a radiant cut diamond and working with a designer, Mr. Osterholm acquired an engagement ring that summer. "I had the ring and it was burning a hole in my pocket," he said. So much so, that despite Ms. DiGiulian having recently sprained her ankle, his goal was to propose on July 21, 2021 at Lion's Lair, a trail the couple often hikes, located on Sanitas Mountain in Boulder.
Mr. Osterholm convinced Ms. DiGiulian to walk their dog together. Unfortunately, she was "hobbling and limping," as they walked along the nearby Dakota Ridge Trail, Mr. Osterholm had to quickly find a spot to propose.
He announced he was going to urinate behind a rock. Once he was kneeling -- or rather, crouching -- he asked Ms. DiGiulian to walk over with the dog. "She was like, 'Why would I come over to where you just peed?"' he said.
Clutching an unintentionally closed ring box, Mr. Osterholm asked Ms. DiGiulian to marry him. "I think she was confused at first because it wasn't open," he said. After asking to see the ring, she said yes.
The couple married Sept. 2 at the Planet Bluegrass, an outdoor venue in Lyons, Colo., about 25 minutes north of Boulder. Robin O'Leary, a friend of the couple who was ordained by the American Marriage Ministries for the occasion, officiated before 165 guests. This included the groom's mother and his father, Alan Hollis Osterholm, and the bride's mother, Andrea Lynn DiGiulian. A moment of silence was held for the bride's late father, John A. DiGiulian.
MooseChaga served as "best canine" (and best man), and walked Mr. Osterholm down the aisle. Ms. DiGiulian wore a white multilayered A-line gown with embroidery by the designer Dany Tabet. The groom wore a light blue suit of wool, silk and linen that was custom made.
The couple shared their first dance to the song "This Year's Love" by David Gray, played by a D.J.
The couple travels often, and all over the world, so when it came time to plan a wedding, they decided to bring everyone to them. "I just wanted to be outside," Ms. DiGiulian said, "and welcome our friends and our family and loved ones into the lifestyle that we live."

When Sept. 2, 2023
An Active Program At 8:30 a.m. on the day of the wedding, Mr. Osterholm held an 11-mile trail run for guests near their home, including the Anemone and Lion's Lair Trails to the summit of Sanitas Mountain. The morning of the rehearsal dinner, the bride hosted a 50-minute cardio and strength class for 11 guests at Mecha, a fitness studio in Boulder, followed by smoothies. And that afternoon the groom held a three-hour Ultimate Frisbee game with aunts, uncles, cousins and friends, at North Boulder Park. "It was a wonderful, sweaty multigenerational affair," Mr. Osterholm said.
Gluten-Free Energy The reception dinner included a vegan and gluten-free crispy polenta cup with wild mushroom ragu and truffle cream; a dairy-free and gluten-free Thai curry chicken summer roll; a gluten-free arugula and mushroom stuffed rainbow trout with lemon butter; and a gluten-free flourless chocolate terrine with sea salt and whipped cream.
Missing In Action The couple had hoped to have their friend Jeff Provenzano, a professional sky diver, descend from above to shower the wedding guests with rose petals at the start of the ceremony. But the venue did not approve it. Mr. Provenzano attended on the ground.

TV Networks’ Last Best Hope: Boomers

This coming week, as the network fall television season gets underway, ABC will begin airing “The Golden Bachelor,” a spinoff of “The Bachelor” that centers on an offbeat twist: The main contestant is a 72-year-old man, and the 22 women vying for his affection range in age from 60 to 75.
On Sunday nights, the network will carve out three hours for “The Wonderful World of Disney,” a television tradition that dates to the 1950s. On Tuesdays, there’s “Dancing With the Stars.” On Wednesdays, there will be special prime-time episodes of decades-old standbys such as “Wheel of Fortune" and “Jeopardy!”
It’s no secret that network television ratings have plummeted in recent years as viewers have fled prime-time lineups in favor of stream-at-your-leisure outlets such as Netflix and Hulu.
But there’s one notable exception, a segment of the audience that has effectively become the broadcast networks’ core constituency: people older than 60.
The median age of viewers at ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox has jumped in recent years. That has left executives looking for ways to acknowledge and nurture an audience that still reliably flips on the television and watches in prime time, the old-fashioned way.
“Boomers are keeping it afloat,” Kevin Reilly, a veteran programming executive who held top jobs at Fox and NBC, said of network TV. The generation, he said, “grew up with organizing their worldview around it — the TV was the center of the living room, and we watched day-and-date.”
This is a critical time for the networks. They are a shell of what they used to be, and no longer the reliable hit factories and cultural forces of yesteryear.
Hollywood’s writers and actors strikes have only made matters worse. The strikes have grounded production for months, forcing the networks to program a piecemeal lineup of reality series, sports, games shows and repeats for the next several months.
Entertainment executives are privately fretting about a ratings collapse — not to mention further migration to streaming — without the vital aid of new scripted original programs.
Just nine years ago, the median age of most top-rated network entertainment shows ranged from the mid-40s to early 50s — it was 45 for the sitcom “How I Met Your Mother” and 52 for “The Big Bang Theory,” according to Nielsen. Some shows, including “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” had a median viewer as young as 39.
But in the most recent network television season, which ended in May, the median viewer was older than 60 for most entertainment shows, including “The Voice” (64.8), “The Masked Singer” (60.6), “Grey’s Anatomy” (64.1) and “Young Sheldon” (“65+,” the highest range that Nielsen provides).
Local television stations have seen similar trends.
“There is a quite distinct generational divide for local broadcast viewing at the age of 45,” according to a recent report from TVREV, a research group. “Generation X and boomers (those 45+) still cling to TV habits they developed as kids, while their kids largely reject local linear broadcast.”
Executives said in interviews that the median age for many of these series was younger when their viewership was measured on the networks’ affiliated streaming services such as Hulu, Peacock and Paramount+. Some shows have median ages that are 20 or 25 years younger than they are on broadcast, they said. The ABC hit “Abbott Elementary,” which has a viewer median age of 60.5 on broadcast, is also popular with younger viewers when it is streamed on Hulu.
Some executives also point out that younger viewers are not adequately measured by existing viewership tools.
“Anyone we’re not capturing on a linear device we are capturing on streaming,” said Radha Subramanyam, chief research officer for CBS.
Still, she added: “At CBS, we love older viewers. They watch a lot of television. And advertisers love them because they have tons and tons of spending power.”
Even so, advertisers still value television audiences younger than 50. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO executive David Zaslav said this month that as much as 75% of the audience of his cable networks was older than 54 and that, as a result, the company was not making as much as it could from advertising.
Dick Wolf, a leading purveyor of procedurals, one of television’s classic genres, is a big presence for CBS’ usual lineup (“FBI,” “FBI: Most Wanted,” “FBI: International”), as well as NBC’s (“Law & Order: SVU,” “Chicago Med,” “Chicago Fire,” “Chicago P.D.”). Last year, NBC brought the original “Law & Order” back to life, starring 82-year-old Sam Waterston.
Other scripted series also come from an earlier time, including NBC’s “Quantum Leap” and “Magnum, P.I.” — which, unlike most of the network’s competitors, will have new episodes this season because they were taped before the strikes. CBS is resurrecting “Matlock,” a show that “The Simpsons” used to lampoon for its older fan base. (The new version of “Matlock” will star Kathy Bates and appear after “60 Minutes,” sometime after the strikes are resolved.)
Last year, NBC found a surprise hit in “Night Court,” a sitcom that debuted nearly four decades ago. (“Night Court” and “Quantum Leap” first appeared on the same night on NBC’s schedule in 1989.) A producer for “Night Court” said this year that the courtroom for the new show was “not filled with tons of computer screens or modern trappings of life — we really intentionally wanted ‘Night Court’ to feel like a place a bit frozen in time.”
At ABC, executives decided to move “The Golden Bachelor” to an 8 p.m. slot on Thursdays, after the network had originally slotted it for Mondays at 10 p.m. One of the reasons: broad enthusiasm for the show as well as a strong lead-in from “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jeopardy!”
“We have an affiliate lead-in that has a median age around 67 or 68, which is smack dab in the middle of that traditional sort of definition of what a baby boomer is,” said Ari Goldman, senior vice president of content strategy and scheduling at ABC Entertainment. “We’re going to be leaning into that abundance of audience that we have going into prime time.”
And, of course, “Wheel of Fortune” and “Jeopardy!” will have their own night to shine, with special prime-time celebrity editions on Wednesdays.
“These are shows that have been staples for the older audience for four or five decades — I think ‘Jeopardy!’ is even going to be hitting 60 years old in some form or another this coming year,” Goldman said. “These are shows that our audience has grown up with, and they’re comforting and sort of throwback programming for that audience.”

Can a Comic Stretch the Truth Too Far?: [Correction]

Full text: The stand-up's penchant for making up stories goes beyond embellishment. When real people and real stakes are involved, a different standard applies.
When I first heard that The New Yorker had published an exposé on the veracity of the stand-up comedy of Hasan Minhaj, I rolled my eyes.
We're fact-checking jokes now? Come on. Comedy is an art, not an op-ed. And honesty has always struck me as the most overrated virtue in comedy. But Clare Malone's reporting in the piece is scrupulous and fair, if a little prosecutorial in its focus. It presents more questions than answers and should inspire some rethinking of the muddy relationship between comedy and truth.
Digging into his last two specials, Malone reveals Hasan Minhaj as a comic who leans on fictions to make real-world arguments, putting himself closer to the center of news stories to make him seem more brave or wronged or in danger. To take one example, Minhaj says in "The King's Jester" (2022) that after the government passed the Patriot Act in the wake of Sept. 11, an undercover F.B.I. informant named Brother Eric had infiltrated his childhood mosque and had dinner at his house. Minhaj recalls how he sniffed him out and, in a prank, asked about getting a pilot's license, which led to a police officer throwing him against a car.
The New Yorker found that there was such a man working in counterterrorism but that Minhaj never met him. Minhaj defended his fabrications as fibs in service to "emotional truth." For someone in the running to be the next host of "The Daily Show," that term sounds a little too much like Kellyanne Conway's euphemism "alternative facts."
Amid plenty of critics online, Whoopi Goldberg was one of the few major figures who spoke up for Minhaj, saying on "The View" that embellishing in the name of a larger truth is what comics do. But here is where some more context would be helpful.
Stand-up comedy was never expected to be factually accurate. Rodney Dangerfield, to be clear, got respect. In the setups for early jokes, Richard Pryor lied about having a Puerto Rican mother and living in a Jewish tenement. An old-school observational comic like Jerry Seinfeld has said all his comedy is made up, even his opinions.
But in the past few decades, with the rise of "The Daily Show," which has blurred lines between comedy and the news, as well as the proliferation of confessional solo shows that depend on dramatic revelations that dovetail nicely with jokes, the form has evolved and so have audiences' assumptions. And they vary wildly depending on the artist.
In Sebastian Maniscalco's last special, "Is It Me?," he told a story poking fun at a kid in his child's class who identifies as a lion. Asked by The Daily Beast, he said that this wasn't true, but that he used it because it puts "a mirror on society" -- another kind of emotional truth. Minhaj's inventions were part of the same tradition, one that deserves new scrutiny.
It's also important to point out that many current comics think seriously about their fictions, setting their own code. "I am quite strict about telling the truth," Daniel Kitson once told me. "I am interested in engaging emotionally and I don't want to be duplicitous."
In an interview this year, Taylor Tomlinson told me she cut a joke about being single after she started dating someone because even that minor white lie made her uncomfortable. Many other comics, like Kate Berlant, build unreliability into their acts. Others lie so overtly that it sets expectations. What's tricky is that there is no one industry standard.
The reality is that some comics have more leeway toying with the truth than others. All artists teach their audience how to view them, by the way they tell jokes, their style, the level of absurdity. What makes Hasan Minhaj such a troubling example is that his style, onstage and often off in interviews, suggested we should believe him.
Minhaj is known for using visual aids the way a journalist would. He mixes clips of television news and photos from his life with a general tone of sincerity. The nature of his deceptions was peculiar. He didn't invent stuff to make himself funnier. He did it to raise the stakes in the easiest, most self-regarding way possible. Lying in comedy isn't necessarily wrong. But how you lie matters. Minhaj has told a story about his prom date reneging on the day of the dance because her parents didn't want her seen in photos with a "brown boy." He now admits to some untruths in this story, but not all, and left her perspective out. (The woman has said she and her family faced online threats for years.) This genre of fiction is a shortcut to sympathy, an unearned tug at the heartstrings. It's not a capital crime, but it's an unnecessary and risky one.
Lies involving real people should add a new sense of obligation. The problem with only considering the standard of emotional truth is that it can blind you to the impact on the actual world outside your emotions. You could say that the emotional truth behind the Patriot Act was that the terrorism of Sept. 11 required extreme tactics to feel safe, but that doesn't make the legislation right. The truth is usually more complex than the way you feel about it.
Watching "The King's Jester" now hits differently. In some ways, it's more interesting than the first time I saw it, when it seemed mawkish. Some jokes, like his desperation for social media clout, seem like clues. And others come across as the work of a guilty conscience, like the moment when Minhaj faces the audience and says: "Everything here is built on trust."
This is the truth. Every comic has an unspoken pact with the audience. The one Seinfeld has is different from Minhaj's, and part of the reason has nothing to do with their intentions. Whether or not critics like me think authenticity is important, it does matter to the audience. So does honesty. And comics understand that. It's no accident that many of the political comedians working today, especially on television, employ researchers from traditional news sources. Getting facts right matters, especially when the comedy is about grave social issues.
That's not just because a comic's credibility can take a hit. When stories told about racism, religious profiling or transgender identity are exposed as inventions, that can lead to doubt about the experiences of real people.
When the storyteller Mike Daisey, making an argument about sweatshop conditions in China, was fact-checked by public radio, the official newspaper of the country's Communist Party used the resulting scandal to try to discredit all reporting by Western media. This kind of argument has only become more common. Look at Russell Brand's defense against accusations of rape and grooming: He tried to discredit his accusers by saying you can't trust the mainstream media.
One of the most notable aspects of the Minhaj story is the lack of nuance in his response, the complete confidence he projects. It's striking that he seemingly has no concerns about possibly deceiving some of his audience. His special is about his wife challenging him to take responsibility for how his words can negatively affect his family. One wonders if there will be any more introspection.
In the summer, Minhaj interviewed President Barack Obama and began by bringing up his annual best-of lists, skeptically asking if he really consumes all of those books, albums and movies. When Obama said he did, Minhaj pushed back: "No, you didn't."
Later on his podcast "Working It Out," Mike Birbiglia asked Minhaj how he could be so bold with the ex-president. Minhaj said his question for Obama was "innocuous." That seems like naïveté masquerading as savvy.
If Obama admitted to lying about even something that inconsequential, it would be a global story. We live in a world where people have long peddled conspiracies about him and would jump on any deception as evidence of some broader scandal. There's a temptation to respond to the onslaught of lies by thinking that the only way to fight back is to lie some more. But that has it wrong. To quote Minhaj, everything is built on trust.
That trust operates differently for politicians and journalists than for artists, but it matters for us all. Treat it carelessly and the price can be steep.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Difficult Men," Brett Martin's book about the prestige TV boom, has been rereleased in a 10th-anniversary edition. In an interview, he reflects on how TV has changed since he wrote it.
Tony Soprano, Don Draper and Omar Little glower from the cover of "Difficult Men: Behind the Scenes of a Creative Revolution," Brett Martin's canon-codifying 2013 book about the prestige TV boom of the 2000s. But as difficult and revolutionary as those fictional antiheroes were, the title just as well describes their brilliant, gnomic, sometimes cruel creators, like David Chase ("The Sopranos"), David Simon ("The Wire") and Matthew Weiner ("Mad Men").
"Difficult Men," whose 10th-anniversary edition was published in paperback this summer, is a history of the remarkable moment, starting nearly 25 years ago, when business imperatives and risk-taking executives empowered ornery writers with network experience and chips on their shoulders to create era-defining, artistically lasting programs.
One of the book's through lines was that these shows tended to revolve around men who resembled the way their creators saw themselves: as mavericks taking arms against bureaucratic inertia. It's a theme that Martin, a New Orleans-based journalist, said he might de-emphasize today in favor of delving into the depth and richness of the characters.
"The artistic triumph the original shows allowed," Martin said earlier this month, "was to create all these real human stories and specific, idiosyncratic characters -- which is more important than the easy antihero formulation."
The past decade has seen a societal reckoning with misconduct in the culture industries, including television. Some of the showrunner behavior Martin chronicled in his book -- icing out disfavored writers, halting entire productions for petty personal whims, throwing tantrums -- looks different now.
In a new preface for the anniversary edition, Martin says that were he writing "Difficult Men" now, he would focus more on "the knotty question of how the same men who provided, in many ways, the most astute critiques of toxic male power that mainstream culture had ever seen could nevertheless end up confirming and recapitulating precisely the same dynamics in their own workplaces."
Even in 2013, Martin held up counterexamples like the showrunners Alan Ball ("Six Feet Under") and Vince Gilligan ("Breaking Bad"), who ran artistically successful programs while being, by all accounts, nice guys and good bosses.
In other respects, 2013 turned out to be a convenient year for a book about this Golden Age of television. It was the year "Breaking Bad" ended and James Gandolfini, the "Sopranos" star, died. And it was the year that "House of Cards," the first original series commissioned by Netflix, debuted. In a phone interview, Martin discussed why the shows he wrote about still hold up and how the emergence of streaming has affected prestige TV. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Was there one show that provoked you to write the book?
It was "The Sopranos," in both an abstract and a literal sense. I had been hired to write the official coffee table companion during the final season. I maybe outstayed my welcome, treated it like a real reporting job, was there for quite a long time and got a chance to peek behind the scenes. It was a revelation to me: the size of the operation, the ambition, the way people talked about their work -- the sense of something very big being made. The number of times I had to explain what a showrunner was back then is, in and of itself, an indicator of what an alien world that was.
It's such a funny term.
It just occurs to me what kind of a technical term "showrunner" is, how unromantic. It really is something that, like, the Teamsters would come up with. It's so literal and so nonartistic: You keep things running. The term betrays the kind of factory mentality that applied to television at the time.
Did you think of yourself as establishing a canon?
It was very obvious what at least three of the four main shows that I was going to write about were, and most of the peripheral ones as well. In my original proposal, the fourth show was, actually, "Rescue Me" -- which is a show whose first few seasons had been perhaps unfairly forgotten but felt very much in keeping with these other shows. It felt extremely daring in being one of the first shows where 9/11 was being treated in a fully rounded way. My first editor pushed me to include "Battlestar Galactica," but it just really wasn't my bag. And then "Breaking Bad" asserted itself as the book was being written and became very obviously the ending place. There were the other HBO shows, and "The Shield" was an important step as well, but there weren't many examples I left out.
Have any of the shows in the book not stood up as much as you expected?
Quite the opposite: The shows you think might have been dated have proven riveting in ways they maybe weren't even when they were on. The America of Tony Soprano, the America of Walter White and very much the America of "The Wire" has proved itself to be the dominant America in the past 20 years. "The Sopranos" became this huge pandemic rewatch, and I think it's because it's so recognizable: The themes -- the rot at the center of America, the grift of American life, the anxiety Tony Soprano has -- are all super familiar to us now.
Younger generations have adopted "The Sopranos"; it appears in countless memes.
It's great entertainment. It had to be: It had to resemble entertaining network television in many ways. It was still operating as a Trojan horse. It had to be funny and human, and it had to be consumable because the high-art part, the ambition part, was something nobody was looking for.
How did the men you wrote about respond to your book?
I never heard a word from any of them except for Vince Gilligan, who wrote me a beautiful blurb on the back of the new edition. Not surprisingly, because the book ends making the point that one doesn't have to be that difficult to create these wonderful shows.
Few would be interested in defending some of the behavior you document. But does the fact that it happened during the creation of these really great series make any of it easier to accept?
It's hard for me to see how a lack of empathy for people who work for you is a necessary part of the creative process. I do think people's feelings could get hurt in a very intense workplace, and I don't think every hurt feeling is avoidable. But I do think one can maintain a basic level of decency -- let alone avoid using your power destructively -- and still create quality work. I believe it because I've seen the shows that prove it, and because I'm optimistic.
There are women characters and characters of color in these shows, but the protagonists and the creators behind them are all white men. Does that taint the legacy of that era?
It wasn't a huge surprise that white men writing about white men dominated the first phase of this new world. But the door had been opened. "Orange Is the New Black" came out something like three weeks after my book. "Transparent" was soon after as well. What came after delivered on the promise, which is that all these other kinds of stories were going to be able to be told, and all these other kinds of voices were going to be empowered. "Atlanta" and "Reservation Dogs" are other deliveries on that promise.
What effect did the rise of streaming platforms, with their hundreds of millions of subscribers, have on Hollywood's appetite for ambitious TV?
When the book was published, it was more important [to the producers of these early prestige series] to stand out and find the right kinds of viewers than to have the most. It made sense that that attitude moved from subscription cable to basic -- in my book, it's HBO to FX and AMC -- and streaming seemed it would be another step in that. But it does seem as though every piece that I identified as being crucial to the invention of this new TV is now a flashpoint in the writers' strike: shorter seasons, writer-producers, writers' rooms. And it's depressing. With all the stuff that looked great, the streamers saw there were opportunities for cost savings.
Are there ways streaming made TV better for viewers?
Oh, my God. Look how much work we got! So much that I can't keep up -- that I feel a constant sense of anxiety about missing things. Look how many new voices we got. That's been the trade-off.

From Ancient Korea, With Timeless Flavor: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: These glossy cookies come from ancient Korea, but their ginger-honey flavors are timeless.
Once, when the chef Junghyun Park was young, his cousin brought a piece of fresh honeycomb over to his house in Seoul.
Mr. Park's mother cherished it, as fresh honey was coveted for its health properties in South Korea, and doled it out only when someone got sick. Stirred into a mug of hot water with a little ginger, the honey made fine tea. "We were drinking it almost like medicine," Mr. Park said.
Recipe: Yakgwa (Honey Cookies)
Perhaps no Korean dish represents the value of honey more than the ancient dessert yakgwa, a deep-fried honey cookie soaked in syrup. Yakgwa ("yak" means medicine and "gwa" means confection) is more than a vessel for coveted sweetness. It connects generations and tells the story of Korea's reverence for tradition and optimism for the future.
Enjoyed since the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), these treats have seen a resurgence in popularity in South Korea and beyond, thanks in part to videos on YouTube and TikTok, and Korean dramas like the Netflix series "Alchemy of Souls."
South Korea's "Generation MZ" (a hybrid of millennials and Gen Zers) are the drivers of this new fixation on the past, more specifically young Koreans who call themselves "halmaenials" (a portmanteau of the words "halmoni," meaning grandma, and millennial). This nostalgic generation has revitalized not only the culinary custom of yakgwa, but also the market for it.
In South Korea, new boutique companies like Golden Piece and Jangin Hangwa are focused on selling yakgwa for modern tastes, with flavors ranging from the original ginger-honey to lavender, chocolate and even cookies-and-cream.
It can be more difficult to get your hands on these cookies than it is to reserve a table at Tatiana at Lincoln Center, and demand has necessitated an online ticketing system known as "yakketing," where eager yakgwa consumers place orders with independent businesses. Shops in Korea can sell out in 60 seconds.
Koreans have long sought after yakgwa with this sort of enthusiasm. Kings of Korea's Goryeo dynasty even banned the making and eating of yakgwa because the popularity of its main ingredients -- wheat, honey and sesame oil -- created scarcity and sent prices soaring.
Traditionally, yakgwa was served only on special occasions, such as festival days like Chuseok and Seollal, birthdays and at life's four rites of passage, known as gwan-hon-sang-je: coming-of-age (gwan), marriage (hon), death (sang) and the veneration of the dead (je), a custom which many families still practice today.
The lesson is universal: Only in maturing through life do you get to partake in its richest pleasures.
When Hyaeweol Choi's mother died in 2012, the funeral made her realize the power of gathering at life's critical junctures, including in death. Funerals are meeting points, said Dr. Choi, a gender historian and professor of Korean studies at the University of Iowa, where strong bonds are forged among relatives, both living and dead, who are otherwise "scattered over time."
A year later, Dr. Choi performed the fourth rite of passage for her mother in the form of jesa, which involves setting a large table with candles and a rich assortment of food and drink offerings for the deceased.
If Dr. Choi's mother had a specialty, it was her encyclopedic knowledge of Korean ceremonial foods like yakgwa and how to present them. That's why the recent commercialization of the cookie, with its ubiquity among young people who respect the tradition enough to reinterpret it, has delighted Dr. Choi. "Food evolves constantly, adjusting to new demands and new tastes," she said.
Today, Koreans enjoy yakgwa outside of those rites of passage, like as an after-school snack or weekday dessert with vanilla ice cream. The Korean restaurant Cho Dang Gol in Manhattan serves on-the-house packages of delicious mini yakgwa at the end of the meal with your check, like soft mints or sticks of gum.
Still, a bite of homemade yakgwa tends to exceed anything store-bought, nine times out of 10. Since yakgwa is fried, the oil can go rancid in mass-produced packaged versions, so making the cookies from scratch is a quest worth pursuing. When fresh, the cookie's sticky, amber syrup should drip off slowly, drenching your fingers, like Winnie the Pooh's paw, in honey.
While the chewy outside gives way, the crunchy interior resists slightly. (The YouTube star and cookbook author Maangchi uses the word "juicy" to describe biting into fresh yakgwa.)
This idiosyncratic dough is a tangle of flour, sesame oil, soju, honey and spices. In my yakgwa, ground ginger and cinnamon recall the gently sugared flavors of Korean staples like sujeonggwa, a refreshing cinnamon punch, and yaksik, a lovely sweetened rice with chestnuts, pine nuts and jujubes (a kind of red date).
The crispy, flaky fried cookies are dunked in a glossy jocheong, a not-too-sweet Korean brown rice syrup, which here is boiled with chunks of fresh ginger and a little honey.
In many ways, the frying is as easy as baking; your medium just happens to be a steady, simmering pool of oil, crowded with disks of dough. They puff ever so slightly to reveal their layers. Soaking crunchy cookie in gingery syrup requires patience, but that's all right. The sweetest things in life take time.
Yakgwa comes in all shapes and sizes, depending on the mold, though the fluted flower shape may be the most common. In "The Korean Cookbook," written by Mr. Park, the chef who sips honey like medicine, and the researcher and chef Jungyoon Choi, there's a recipe for a crispier, flakier variation of yakgwa in the form of rectangles. This style is emblematic of a rich food culture Mr. Park called a "hidden gem of Korean cuisine," from the city of Kaesong in North Korea.
"Of course we cannot go there anymore," he said. But that doesn't mean there's not a connection. "We share the culture, we share the language and we share the food as well."
Despite its ancient roots, yakgwa is hardly a time capsule. Like the city of Seoul, it's a living, breathing piece of tangible heritage. Iterating is what keeps it alive.

With Actors on Strike, Directors Take Spotlight: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Since striking movie stars are not allowed to promote studio films, filmmakers unexpectedly, and in some cases uneasily, have the spotlight to themselves.
For more than half a century, a coterie of critics and filmmakers has been making the case for what's known as auteur theory: the idea that great directors are the central creative forces behind their films, shaping them just as authors shape their books.
But outside a relatively small pantheon of great filmmakers, most directors have continued to be overshadowed, at least in the public eye, by their movie stars.
The Hollywood strikes are changing that.
With striking actors forbidden by their union from promoting studio films, directors suddenly have the spotlight largely to themselves, if somewhat reluctantly. They have been the main attractions at recent film festivals in Venice, Telluride and Toronto and on press tours that were once organized around A-list movie stars.
Even star vehicles must be promoted without their stars. With Denzel Washington, one of the most recognizable names in Hollywood, and his co-star, Dakota Fanning, unable to promote the third installment of the "Equalizer" series, it fell to the director, Antoine Fuqua, to go on a one-man press tour.
"It's a strange time," Fuqua told a TV news reporter ahead of the movie's Sept. 1 premiere. "I would love to have them here."
At the Toronto International Film Festival, Q. and A. sessions after screenings typically involve actors and filmmakers, but this year, many of the directors -- including Ava DuVernay and Richard Linklater -- answered questions alone. Behind-the-scenes figures were suddenly in front of the cameras: As the red carpet at the festival opened, a staff member warned the press and onlookers not to be surprised if they didn't recognize some of the people posing for photos, assuring them that they were associated with the films.
Atom Egoyan, a Canadian filmmaker whose relationship with the Toronto festival goes back 40 years, said the focus on filmmaking over celebrity at this year's event reminded him of the festival's earlier years, before the increasing presence of studio films made high-profile Hollywood actors more of a central focus there.
"Certainly for auteur filmmakers, it's been a breath of fresh air," said Egoyan, whose latest movie, "Seven Veils," starring Amanda Seyfried, debuted in Toronto last week. "The industry is going through monumental transitions, and so this has been a nice little oasis."
And as the Venice International Film Festival closed earlier this month, the director Yorgos Lanthimos accepted the competition's top prize for his surrealist comedy "Poor Things" without any of the film's stars behind him.
"Celebrity is always going to sell more than a director," said David Gerstner, a professor of cinema studies at City University of New York. "But it is a moment in which directors are being given the opportunity to shine, to be the centerpiece. It's just unfortunate that it's under these circumstances."
It is not necessarily a comfortable position for some of the directors, amid broad social pressure to stand in solidarity with unionized writers and actors against the major entertainment studios they are at odds with.
And there are already bubbling tensions: When the union that represents Hollywood directors, the Directors Guild of America, made a deal with the studios in June, keeping them out of the labor unrest, it drew some criticism from striking screenwriters.
Caught in the middle of the studios that fund their ambitions and the actors and writers who help realize them, directors tend to tread carefully when discussing the strike.
"I can understand both sides," the director David Fincher said earlier this month at a news conference for the Venice premiere of his movie "The Killer," whose star, Michael Fassbender, was absent. "I think all we can do is encourage them to talk."
It is a particularly complicated moment for directors who are also actors or writers and hold multiple union memberships.
Bradley Cooper, who both directs and stars in "Maestro," about the conductor Leonard Bernstein, decided not to attend the film's premiere at the Venice Film Festival.
And Kenneth Branagh -- who both directs the new Agatha Christie mystery movie "A Haunting in Venice," which debuted in theaters this past weekend, and stars in it as the detective Hercule Poirot -- has decided to leave interviews about the film to behind-the-scenes figures such as a top producer, the production designer and the composer.
Between the multiple roles many artists hold, and the fact that some actors have been given permission by their union, SAG-AFTRA, to promote independent films, the landscape is a bit confusing.
"It's a little bit like the wild west," said Peter Principato, chief executive of a Hollywood management production company that represents directors, actors and writers.
People are making their own calculations, he said: Some are simply following the letter of the rules, which allows multi-hyphenates to promote movies in a director's capacity, while others are more wary of taking active roles. In some cases, he said, directors are required by their contracts to promote their films.
Of course, some directors are as much of a draw as their stars. Few directors attract as much natural interest as Martin Scorsese, whose highly anticipated, Apple-backed film "Killers of the Flower Moon" is slated for release in theaters next month, even if the movie's stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, are unable to act as the magnets for press that they typically are.
And Fuqua, the director of "The Equalizer 3," has the kind of heightened profile -- thanks to a varied career creating music videos for stars like Prince and Stevie Wonder, directing successful Hollywood thrillers, and making documentaries -- that can make him a successful emissary for the film, noted Alan Nierob, a publicist for the director. Fuqua promoted the movie by speaking with "Good Morning America" about his career; with movie blogs about the trilogy; and with myriad other publications.
The strike is also testing the accepted wisdom of movie marketing. Nierob noted that the limitations around promotion had not appeared to affect the movie's release; it topped the U.S. box office its first weekend, earning just under $ 35 million. (Of course, Washington's name on a movie poster or face in a trailer may do the promotional work as well as any interview.)
But it is unusual to see directors carry so much of the promotional weight on their shoulders. With this summer's Disney horror-comedy "Haunted Mansion" unable to rely on its big-name actors -- LaKeith Stanfield, Owen Wilson, Danny DeVito and Jamie Lee Curtis among them -- its director, Justin Simien, who is also a member of the Writers Guild, went on interviews alone. "I felt pulled at the seams," he said in an interview with The New York Times.
And to promote the superhero film "Blue Beetle," which topped the box office last month, Warner Bros. sent the director Ángel Manuel Soto to England, Mexico and around the United States, including Puerto Rico, to host screenings and conduct an estimated 100 interviews.
At festivals, directors have been faced with questions that, in previous years, they would have sat back and let the actors answer.
Lanthimos, whose film "Poor Things" generated buzz at Venice both for its Oscars potential and its many boundary-pushing sex scenes, was the only person at the festival's news conference who could speak to the movie's graphic nature and how its lead actress, Emma Stone, had handled it.
"It's a shame that Emma could not be here to speak more about it, because it will be coming all from me," Lanthimos said at the news conference, where he was flanked by his cinematographer and one of his production designers. He later noted, according to Variety: "We had to be confident Emma had to have no shame about her body, nudity, engaging in those scenes, and she understood that right away."
And at the Telluride Film Festival last month, Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, the directors of "Nyad," the Netflix film about the marathon swimmer Diana Nyad, were not only without their stars, Annette Bening and Jodie Foster, but without the main subject of the movie, who also happens to be a SAG-AFTRA member.
After the film's first screening, the directors said they wished that Nyad and the movie's stars could have been there to see it, and share their own perspectives with the audience.
"It's tough to have to try to speak for them," Chin said.
Mekado Murphy contributed reporting from Toronto and Nicole Sperling from Telluride, Colo.

Once, when chef Junghyun Park was young, his cousin brought a piece of fresh honeycomb over to his house in Seoul.
Park’s mother cherished it, as fresh honey was coveted for its health properties in South Korea, and doled it out only when someone got sick. Stirred into a mug of hot water with a little ginger, the honey made fine tea. “We were drinking it almost like medicine,” Park said.
Perhaps no Korean dish represents the value of honey more than the ancient dessert yakgwa, a deep-fried honey cookie soaked in syrup. Yakgwa (“yak” means medicine and “gwa” means confection) is more than a vessel for coveted sweetness. It connects generations and tells the story of Korea’s reverence for tradition and optimism for the future.
Enjoyed since the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), these treats have seen a resurgence in popularity in South Korea and beyond, thanks in part to videos on YouTube and TikTok, and Korean dramas like the Netflix series “Alchemy of Souls.”
South Korea’s “Generation MZ” (a hybrid of millennials and Gen Zers) are the drivers of this new fixation on the past, more specifically young Koreans who call themselves “halmaenials” (a portmanteau of the words “halmoni,” meaning grandma, and millennial). This nostalgic generation has revitalized not only the culinary custom of yakgwa, but also the market for it.
In South Korea, new boutique companies like Golden Piece and Jangin Hangwa are focused on selling yakgwa for modern tastes, with flavors ranging from the original ginger-honey to lavender, chocolate and even cookies-and-cream.
It can be more difficult to get your hands on these cookies than it is to reserve a table at Tatiana at Lincoln Center, and demand has necessitated an online ticketing system known as “yakketing,” where eager yakgwa consumers place orders with independent businesses. Shops in Korea can sell out in 60 seconds.
Koreans have long sought after yakgwa with this sort of enthusiasm. Kings of Korea’s Goryeo dynasty even banned the making and eating of yakgwa because the popularity of its main ingredients — wheat, honey and sesame oil — created scarcity and sent prices soaring.
Traditionally, yakgwa was served only on special occasions, such as festival days like Chuseok and Seollal, birthdays and at life’s four rites of passage, known as gwan-hon-sang-je: coming-of-age (gwan), marriage (hon), death (sang) and the veneration of the dead (je), a custom which many families still practice today.
The lesson is universal: Only in maturing through life do you get to partake in its richest pleasures.
When Hyaeweol Choi’s mother died in 2012, the funeral made her realize the power of gathering at life’s critical junctures, including in death. Funerals are meeting points, said Choi, a gender historian and professor of Korean studies at the University of Iowa, where strong bonds are forged among relatives, both living and dead, who are otherwise “scattered over time.”
A year later, Choi performed the fourth rite of passage for her mother in the form of jesa, which involves setting a large table with candles and a rich assortment of food and drink offerings for the deceased.
If Choi’s mother had a specialty, it was her encyclopedic knowledge of Korean ceremonial foods like yakgwa and how to present them. That’s why the recent commercialization of the cookie, with its ubiquity among young people who respect the tradition enough to reinterpret it, has delighted Choi. “Food evolves constantly, adjusting to new demands and new tastes,” she said.
Today, Koreans enjoy yakgwa outside of those rites of passage, like as an after-school snack or weekday dessert with vanilla ice cream. Korean restaurant Cho Dang Gol in Manhattan serves on-the-house packages of delicious mini yakgwa at the end of the meal with your check, like soft mints or sticks of gum.
Still, a bite of homemade yakgwa tends to exceed anything store-bought, nine times out of 10. Since yakgwa is fried, the oil can go rancid in mass-produced packaged versions, so making the cookies from scratch is a quest worth pursuing. When fresh, the cookie’s sticky, amber syrup should drip off slowly, drenching your fingers, like Winnie the Pooh’s paw, in honey.
While the chewy outside gives way, the crunchy interior resists slightly. (The YouTube star and cookbook author Maangchi uses the word “juicy” to describe biting into fresh yakgwa.)
This idiosyncratic dough is a tangle of flour, sesame oil, soju, honey and spices. In my yakgwa, ground ginger and cinnamon recall the gently sugared flavors of Korean staples like sujeonggwa, a refreshing cinnamon punch, and yaksik, a lovely sweetened rice with chestnuts, pine nuts and jujubes (a kind of red date).
The crispy, flaky fried cookies are dunked in a glossy jocheong, a not-too-sweet Korean brown rice syrup, which here is boiled with chunks of fresh ginger and a little honey.
In many ways, the frying is as easy as baking; your medium just happens to be a steady, simmering pool of oil, crowded with disks of dough. They puff ever so slightly to reveal their layers. Soaking crunchy cookie in gingery syrup requires patience, but that’s all right. The sweetest things in life take time.
Yakgwa comes in all shapes and sizes, depending on the mold, though the fluted flower shape may be the most common. In “The Korean Cookbook,” written by Park, the chef who sips honey like medicine, and researcher and chef Jungyoon Choi, there’s a recipe for a crispier, flakier variation of yakgwa in the form of rectangles. This style is emblematic of a rich food culture Park called a “hidden gem of Korean cuisine,” from the city of Kaesong in North Korea.
“Of course we cannot go there anymore,” he said. But that doesn’t mean there’s not a connection. “We share the culture, we share the language and we share the food as well.”
Despite its ancient roots, yakgwa is hardly a time capsule. Like the city of Seoul, it’s a living, breathing piece of tangible heritage. Iterating is what keeps it alive.

— Yakgwa (Honey Cookies)
By Eric Kim
These not-too-sweet Korean honey cookies, fried and then soaked in gingery syrup, are uniquely soft and chewy on the outside and flaky on the inside. Called yakgwa (yak meaning “medicine” and gwa meaning “confection”), these treats originally from the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392) are seeing a resurgence in popularity from Seoul to the world, thanks to social media. Traditionally served on Korean festival days like Chuseok and Seollal, birthdays and ancestral rites like jesa, the anniversary of a loved one’s passing, yakgwa are also an encapsulation of Korea’s dessert history. At a time when sugar was not a main sweetener, sweetness was achieved with ingredients like rice syrup and honey, paired with ginger and cinnamon. Enjoy these on their own with a cup of tea or try them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, which lends balance to the sticky sweetness. For a vegan option, the honey can be swapped with maple syrup for incredible results.
Yield: 20 (2-inch) cookies
Total time: About 27 hours
Ingredients:
For the cookies:
2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
5 tablespoons soju (see Tips), plus more if needed
About 1 quart canola or vegetable oil, for frying
Crystallized ginger, sesame seeds or pine nuts, for garnish (optional)
For the syrup:
1/2 cup jocheong (Korean brown rice syrup; see Tips)
2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
1 (2-inch) piece fresh (unpeeled) ginger, sliced
Preparation:
1. Make the cookie dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, ground ginger, cinnamon, 1 teaspoon salt and 3 grinds pepper. Add the sesame oil and whisk to distribute. Switching to a spoon, stir in the honey and soju until there’s no more loose flour and the mixture starts to form a craggy dough. If needed, you can add more soju, 1 teaspoon at a time, until the dough is hydrated. Press the dough together with your hands, cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator to rest for at least 1 hour and up to 2, during which it will continue to hydrate and cohere even more.
2. Meanwhile, make the syrup: In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the brown rice syrup, honey, ginger and 2 tablespoons water to a boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and set aside, covered, to infuse and cool slightly.
3. Roll out the cookies: Using a rolling pin or empty wine bottle, roll the dough into a rectangle that is roughly 1/4-inch-thick, then fold it in half, pressing the sides to create even edges and roll it out again. Fold and roll the dough out like this 4 more times.
4. Use a round, 2-inch cookie cutter (or the lip of a champagne flute) to cut out rounds. You will need to roll out the scraps a few more times to use up all of the dough, resulting in about 20 cookies. Using a fork, dock the top of each cookie twice, piercing all the way through.
5. Fry the cookies: Set a wire rack on a sheet pan. In a wide pot, heat about 1 inch of oil to 225 degrees over medium, then reduce the heat to low. Working in batches, add the cookies in a single layer and fry until deeply golden brown and slightly puffed, 25 to 30 minutes per batch. (Flip cookies occasionally for even browning and adjust the heat as needed so the oil bubbles gently and stays 225 degrees.) Transfer the cookies to the rack and cool fully, at least 30 minutes.
6. Soak the cookies: Remove the ginger from the syrup. Transfer the cookies to a wide resealable container, drizzle evenly with the syrup and toss to coat. Cover tightly and soak at room temperature overnight (or up to 24 hours), flipping occasionally to evenly soak.
7. Before serving, remove the cookies from the syrup, then garnish with crystallized ginger, sesame seeds or pine nuts, if desired. In a tightly sealed container, fresh yakgwa keep for up to 3 days at room temperature.
Tips:
Soju, Korea’s national beverage, is a clear and distilled grain alcohol that can be found in most liquor stores. It tends to come in 375-milliliter glass bottles with screw tops, making it ideal to keep on hand for cooking (or drinking). If you can’t find soju, vodka and sake work in a pinch.
Some yakgwa recipes call for replacing the not-too-sweet brown rice syrup, jocheong, with all honey or corn syrup, but those results might lean too sweet. A bottle of jocheong is not just a nuanced sweetener but also makes yakgwa glisten. It’s a valuable ingredient that can be found online and in Korean grocery stores.

U.S. Strikes Are Felt in U.K.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Many U.S. studios' blockbusters are filmed in Britain, so the walkouts by actors and screenwriters have caused thousands of U.K. film crews to lose work.
What do "Barbie," "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning" and "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" have in common? Besides being the summer's big-budget movies, they were made in Britain, filmed in part at some of the country's most esteemed studios.
Big Hollywood productions are a critical part of Britain's film and television industry. For years, they have brought in money, jobs and prestige, and helped make the sector a bright spot in Britain's economy. But now, that special relationship has brought difficulty.
The strikes by actors and screenwriters in the United States, which have ground much of Hollywood to a standstill, are also being strongly felt in Britain, where productions including "Deadpool 3," "Wicked" and Part 2 of "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning" stopped filming. Throughout the late summer months, when the industry would be at its busiest to take advantage of the long days, soundstages at Pinewood, Britain's largest studios, were instead nearly empty.
Film crews, like camera workers and costume designers, are out of work after productions abruptly stopped. Bectu, the British union for workers in behind-the-scenes roles in creative industries, surveyed nearly 4,000 of its film and TV members and 80 percent said their jobs had been affected, with three-quarters not working.
"Irrespective of whether you think the studios are right or whether the unions are right, there are people who are suffering in the U.K.," said Marcus Ryder, the incoming chief executive of the Film and TV Charity, which supports workers who are struggling financially.
In August, the charity received more than 320 applications for hardship grants, compared with 37 a year earlier.
Since the first "Star Wars" movie was filmed partly in a studio in England in the mid-1970s, British film studios have been a top destination for American productions, and that impetus gathered pace in the past decade thanks to generous tax incentives and moviemakers' demand for experienced crews. More recently, Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services have snapped up studio space so quickly they set off a boom in studio building.
These big-budget productions employ thousands of local workers, and pour billions into the economy. Last year, a record 6.3 billion pounds ( $ 7.8 billion) was spent on film and high-end TV productions in Britain, according to the British Film Institute. Nearly 90 percent came from American studios or other foreign productions.
The number of films or television shows delayed in Britain since mid-July, when Hollywood actors joined the writers' strike, is relatively small, maybe about a dozen, but they are the big productions that require lots of crew and support an ecosystem of visual effects companies, catering and other services.
Charlotte Sewell, an assistant costume designer living in London, was working on the "Mission: Impossible" movie when the strikes stopped production. For a few weeks, she was able to work one day a week, but now that has ended, too.
"Now my one-day week has gone, I'll be trying to find some something somewhere," she said. "I'm not sure where yet."
Ms. Sewell, who is also the chair of the Bectu committee for costume and wardrobe department workers, said she supported the strikes, and she was confident she would be able to return to "Mission: Impossible" when the disputes ended.
In the meantime, she's nervous about her finances, especially paying her next self-employment tax bill, which is due in January.
"Because I've been in the industry a long time, I suppose, mentally, I'm more equipped to deal with the downtime, but financially not," she said.
She started in the business in 1992. Back then, the film industry was in "dire straits" after a funding slump, Ms. Sewell said, but recent years have been "amazing." There has been a noticeable shift in her work toward big American productions.
"We depend so much on U.S. studio-based productions for our work," she said, because British productions have died down. "I used to work in independent film all the time. I haven't done it for years because it just isn't there."
The problems for British workers has been exacerbated by a slowdown in domestic production, said Philippa Childs, the head of Bectu. The BBC's funding from viewers, through a license fee, was frozen by the government for two years until April 2024, and other British broadcasters are struggling with a drop in advertising revenue, restricting their ability to commission new work, especially as production costs are high. At the same time, film workers have been facing a squeeze on their own budgets from stubbornly high inflation.
Bectu is supportive of SAG-AFTRA, the Hollywood union that represents actors, Ms. Childs said, in part because the issues that have provoked the U.S. walkout, like the use of artificial intelligence by studios, will "inevitably" have a big impact in Britain, too.
Most workers in the industry are freelancers, but unions say that does not mean the work is always precarious. After the pandemic lockdowns, demand for workers was high, and the industry was full of stories of people suddenly moving to other productions for better pay.
"We've gone from feast to famine," Ms. Childs said.
The ripple effects from the strikes are mostly on productions with stars who are SAG-AFTRA members -- who tend to be U.S.-based actors. But the impact is expected to grow, affecting more workers. Many parts of the British film industry are insulated from the strikes, however; domestic productions, with British actors or British union agreements, have gone on.
That could change. Equity, the British actors union, is closely watching the Hollywood negotiations ahead of contract renewals in Britain. A request for a 15 percent pay increase has been submitted to the production companies and will be followed by negotiations on working rights and conditions. Equity has a campaign called "Stop AI Stealing the Show," arguing that British law is failing to protect the rights of performers.
"We're obviously going to want what the Americans want," said Paul Fleming, the general secretary of Equity. "So we are facing the prospect of industrial unrest in the middle of next year."
For the past 13 years, Ian Ogden has worked as a grip, a crew member who moves and supports the camera. He was on reshoots for Disney's live-action remake of "Snow White" when strikes shut down filming in July.
"It's been pretty bleak ever since," he said.
Last month, Mr. Ogden said, he earned three-quarters of what he needed, and was using savings set aside for his two young children to pay for groceries. For weeks, he struggled to find new work as the productions still running tended to be smaller, not requiring as many cameras or grips, he said. Recently, he has found work on a British television production.
A member of Bectu who also holds a position in a charitable organization for grips, Mr. Ogden said, "I support the fight for rights." But he does not support the strike, he said, because it is hurting the offscreen workers who don't have the kind of financial support that Hollywood actors do.
"The people that it's affected in this country -- we're not millionaires," he said.

Full text: For brides who want to feel glamorous at every moment on their wedding day, ornate robes embellished with feathers, lace and sequins are a go-to option for pre-wedding looks.
A few months before her wedding, Veronica Ume-Ezeoke was scrolling through Pinterest when she stumbled upon an elaborate tulle, ruffled robe from Voir Bride, a Ukrainian brand. Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke already had a delicate lace robe to wear while getting ready for her July 2022 wedding, but she sent it to her sister anyway.
"I was like, 'Oh my gosh, could you imagine?"' Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke, 31, said. "My sister, a very facetious lady, was like, 'Hideous. Ugly. Totally not you.' And I was a little offended."
Turns out, Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke's sister could picture her wearing it and bought it for her as a surprise. Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke, a senior associate at a health care tech company, had three wedding ceremonies to celebrate her and her husband's different cultures -- Nigerian, Korean and American.
An ornate robe felt right for getting ready with her bridal party for the American wedding. "I wanted to have this one moment of collective feminine energy and to pop champagne and be sexy," Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke said. She's not alone in wanting to bask in the getting ready aspect of the day.
Getting ready photos have long been customary, but according to Chi-Chi Ari, a photographer in New York, a larger emphasis has been put on them recently. "When you see this big production of getting ready on social media, brides see that and feel like they have to incorporate that into their weddings," Ms. Ari said.
And they've become significantly more stylized, too, said Minh Cao, a Philadelphia-based photographer. "More thought goes into how that part of the day should be captured," Ms. Cao said. "I've definitely seen the getting ready portion of the day getting more complex."
When hunting for an outfit to get ready in for her June 2021 wedding, Danielle Tullo La Testa noticed that most brides wore white button-down shirts and simple pajamas, rather than "standout robes."
"You're getting ready for your wedding more than you're doing anything else on that day," said Mrs. Tullo La Testa, the founder of DLT Creative, a social media agency. "So with that idea, I wanted something unique and special, the same way my wedding dress was."
She commissioned a custom open-back robe with feathers, lace and a train from Lé Lauriér, a bridal designer in Brooklyn. Mrs. Tullo La Testa is also the founder and chief executive of Partier, a custom merchandising brand often used for wedding events, and she's recently noticed other brides leaning into similar attire for their own weddings. There are also more options available for brides who want more glamour. "I think I've seen them pop up everywhere," Mrs. Tullo La Testa, 29, said of the fancy robes. "I'm seeing them pop up in a smaller way on Etsy now, too."
Alisha Walt, 31, a legal coordinator for Gibson, a guitar company, chose a custom robe from Lé Lauriér over pajamas for her wedding last October. She didn't want it to be "an everyday kind of thing," she said. The robe "really took it to the next level for me, and it truly made me feel like it was my wedding."
Lauren Holovka, the designer behind Lé Lauriér, started her brand in 2018 and released her first collection of couture bridal robes, The Dress Before The Dress, shortly after. Ms. Holovka, 29, has noticed a significant boom in business in the last few years with more and more brides searching for couture getting-ready outfits. "Photographers tell me all the time, 'We literally had to put a time slot in just for your bridal robe,"' she said.
Ms. Holovka, who has a team of six to 10 people, estimates that she creates around 150 to 200 bespoke bridal robes each month during busy season for clients around the world, including celebrities like Heather Rae El Moussa from the reality TV show "Selling Sunset" on Netflix and Teresa Giudice of "The Real Housewives of New Jersey." Custom robes, which typically take about four to six months to make, range from $ 2,550 to $ 5,800, while ready-to-wear robes cost less than $ 1,000 and are not as elaborate.
Ms. Holovka doesn't expect brides to wear these robes while having their hair and makeup done and recommends a separate robe for that.
"For hair and makeup, I very much wanted to be in my element," said Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke, who wore a white button-up shirt while getting her hair and makeup done. "And then I stepped into that bridal robe to change the mood and signal, 'OK, it's time to party now."'
While some robes can be just as luxurious as some wedding gowns, robes offer a bit is more versatility and can easily be worn again in the future, making it a worthwhile investment. Mrs. Tullo La Testa calls hers a "modern heirloom" and hopes to pass it down to her newborn daughter, Juliette, when she's of age.
While Mrs. Ume-Ezeoke has offered her robe to friends who are planning weddings, so they have their "something borrowed," she also envisions giving it to a daughter or niece in the future. Many brides re-wear their robes for maternity shoots as well, Ms. Holovka said, and some even return to the designer to repurpose them as Christening gowns for babies.
"I wouldn't even care if I never wore it again," said Mrs. Walt, who did end up wearing it on her honeymoon in Italy. "It was so special for the day. It was one of the best things that I've done."

To Know Yourself, Consider Your Doppelgänger: [Op-Ed]

Author: Klein, Naomi

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This past July, Merriam-Webster announced on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that "'doppelgänger' is currently one of our top lookups."
The doppelgänger -- defined by Merriam-Webster as a "person who resembles someone else, or a ghostly counterpart of a living person" -- is suddenly unavoidable. Social media platforms are crowded with videos of that moment when a pair of uncanny look-alikes come face-to-face at a friend's wedding or in a Las Vegas swimming pool or on a plane. A Taylor Swift doppelgänger has collected 1.6 million followers on TikTok, and the real Ms. Swift performs multiple alter-ego versions of herself in the "Anti-Hero" video. Rachel Weisz doubles herself in the remake of "Dead Ringers," and Netflix's latest season of "Black Mirror" begins with an episode wherein computer-generated versions of celebrities impersonate ordinary people.
There has even been a burst of doppelgänger-on-doppelgänger violence. Last year, a woman in Germany was accused of murdering her glamorous beauty-blogger look-alike with the aim of using the body to fake her own death. And in February, a Russian-born New Yorker was convicted of attempted murder: She had fed poisoned cheesecake to her doppelgänger in hopes of stealing her identity.
Though doppelgängers reliably elicit feelings of vertigo, I find the sudden prevalence of doubles oddly comforting. For years I struggled privately with a problem I considered rather niche: being perennially confused and conflated with another writer and outspoken political analyst named Naomi, Naomi Wolf, even though I bear only a passing resemblance to her. (And I would see the same thing happening to her.) Once best known for best-selling feminist books like "The Beauty Myth" and for a controversial role advising Al Gore's presidential run, Ms. Wolf has more recently distinguished herself as an industrial-scale disseminator of vaccine-related medical misinformation, as well as a fixture on pro-Trump shows like the one hosted daily by Steve Bannon.
I sometimes wondered what I had done to deserve my doppelgänger woes. With popular culture feeling increasingly like a house of mirrors with duplicated and simulated and similar selves endlessly contorted, many more of us may soon be dealing with versions of doppelgänger confusion. What role is this proliferation of doubles, twins and clones playing? Doppelgängers, which combine the German words "doppel" (double) and "gänger" (goer), are often regarded as warnings or omens.
In an attempt to better understand the warnings carried by my doppelgänger experience, I spent many evenings immersing myself in the rich repertory of doppelgänger films. One that proved particularly helpful was Jordan Peele's "Us." This 2019 horror film imagines a society much like our own, only sitting on top of a shadowy underworld, inhabited by warped doubles of everyone living aboveground. Every move above is mirrored below in darkness and misery. Until the underground doppelgängers get tired of the arrangement and wreak havoc.
Who are these underground people? one terrified character asks.
"We're Americans," comes the gut punch of an answer.
The film has been interpreted as an allegory for capitalism's entanglements with racial and other forms of oppression, with the comforts of the few requiring the exploitation of a shadow world. That understanding landed particularly hard during the pandemic, when I watched the film. Those of us who were part of the lockdown class were able to shelter in place because we were being served by essential workers, many of whom did not have the ability to call in sick. Doubles often play this role, offering viewers and readers uncomfortable ways into their own story. By showing us a character facing her doppelgänger, we are exposed to parts of ourselves we can least bear to see, but at a slight angle and through a warped mirror.
Perhaps that's why representations of doubles seem to surge during moments of extreme violence and change. The first major piece of theoretical work on the subject was an essay, titled "Der Doppelgänger," by the Austrian psychoanalyst Otto Rank, then a protégé of Sigmund Freud. Postulating that doppelgängers were tools to express sublimated desires and terrors, it was written in 1914, just as World War I began. In a reissue of the essay in 1971, Rank's translator, Harry Tucker Jr., wondered, "Is there some relationship between extensive disruptions of society, with their concomitant unsettling effects upon the individual, and the interest of the literate public in descriptions of doubles imaginatively portrayed?"
Certainly, the rise of Nazism and the atrocities of the Holocaust inspired another such wave, as artists deployed doubles to grapple with the transformation of previously liberal and open societies. Children into soldiers. Colleagues into killers. Neighbors into mobs. As if a switch had been flipped. It's the intimacy and familiarity of these transformations that are so ominous -- and what is more intimate and familiar than a person's double?
We are, once again, at a historical juncture where our physical and political worlds are changing too quickly and too consequentially for our minds to easily comprehend. This is why I decided to start regarding my own doppelgänger as a narrow aperture through which to look at forces I consider dangerous and that can be hard to confront directly.
Rather than worry about people thinking that she and I were one and the same, I got interested in the ways she seems to have become a doppelgänger of her former self. Because I have been getting confused with Ms. Wolf for close to a decade and half, I knew that she had been dabbling in conspiracy culture for years. (I would periodically get harangued online for positions she had taken.)
Before the pandemic, her underlying values seemed somewhat stable: feminism, sexual freedom, democracy, basic liberalism. Then, rather suddenly, they appeared less so. In a matter of months, I watched her go from questioning masks in schools to questioning election results alongside Mr. Bannon. Next she was engaging in Jan. 6 revisionism, condoning the Supreme Court's assault on abortion rights, posting about her firearms and also warning that "war is being waged upon us."
This is a phenomenon far larger than Ms. Wolf, of course. A great many of us have witnessed it in people we know, once respected and even still love. We tell one another that they have disappeared down the rabbit hole, lost to conspiratorial fantasies, embracing apocalyptic language, seemingly unreachable by affection or reason.
These changes are redrawing political maps, shifting parts of the traditional liberal and New Age left over to the hard right. Trucker convoys in Canada in January 2022. A conspiracy-fueled coup attempt in Germany at the end of that year. The war my doppelgänger keeps warning about in the United States.
Which brings me to the form of doppelgänger that preoccupies me most: the fascist clown state that is the ever-present twin of liberal Western democracies, perpetually threatening to engulf us in its fires of selective belonging and ferocious despising. The figure of the doppelgänger has been used for centuries to warn us of shadow versions of our collective selves, of these monstrous possible futures.
Have our doppelgängers overtaken us? Not yet, not all of us, anyway. But the pandemic, layered on top of so many other long-repressed emergencies, has taken humanity somewhere we have not been before, a place close but different, a kind of doppelgänger world. This is what accounts for the strangeness so many of us have been trying to name -- everything so familiar and yet more than a little off. Uncanny people, upside-down politics, even, as artificial intelligence accelerates, a growing difficulty discerning who and what is real.
That feeling of disorientation -- of not understanding whom we can trust and what to believe -- that we tell one another about? Of friends and loved ones seeming like strangers? It's because our world has changed but, as if we're having a collective case of jet lag, most of us are still attuned to the rhythms and habits of the place and selves we left behind. It's past time to find our bearings.
Doppelgängers, by showing us the supremacist values and violent behaviors that pose the greatest threats to our societies, can spur us to more stable ground.

Cable TV Is on Life Support, But a New Bundle Is Coming Alive: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A funny thing happened in recent weeks, as the media industry wrung its hands over the long-anticipated death of the lucrative cable-TV bundle: Hundreds of thousands of people turned to a different bundle.
Take Christopher Antoniacci of Anna Maria, Fla. When the standoff between Disney and the cable giant Charter left him among nearly 15 million cable subscribers without ESPN and many other channels, he took matters into his own hands.
At Charter's suggestion, Mr. Antoniacci, 74, downloaded FuboTV, a streaming service that offers channels including ESPN. Nearly 500,000 people did the same over the last two weeks, according to Sensor Tower, an analytics firm.
"It has almost everything that I require," said Mr. Antoniacci, who signed up for a free trial. "It's a cable substitute, and it appears to be working," he added.
As cord cutting accelerates across the country, with millions of Americans dropping their traditional cable-TV packages each year, it threatens to upend the pay-TV bundle, a linchpin of the media industry for decades. That became clear when Charter, in its war of words with Disney, declared that parts of the cable bundle were "broken."
But the resolution between the two companies this week signaled that the bundle is probably not going anywhere. It's just adjusting for new viewing habits, with cable companies aiming to sell new packages that include streaming services.
As part of the deal, Disney+, a streaming service that includes many of Disney's biggest shows and movies, will now be offered to Charter's TV customers.
"We very much can look back at this Disney-Charter deal as an opening salvo of a broader re-bundling," MoffettNathanson, an influential research firm, said in a note on Monday.
For more than a half-century, the cable-TV bundle was one of the best businesses in the history of media. TV giants like Disney were paid twice: first by cable distributors, which shelled out billions every year to have channels like ESPN available for their subscribers, and then by advertisers, which opened their wallets to promote products alongside the hottest shows.
The bundle was also good for the cable providers, which steadily added subscribers: At the peak of traditional cable in 2012, more than 100 million Americans paid for the bundle.
That era is gone. Now, about five million people abandon cable TV every year -- leaving about 75 million Americans in the traditional TV ecosystem, according to analyst estimates.
Most analysts believe that 40 million to 60 million Americans will continue to subscribe to some form of traditional cable in the years to come. The sharp falloff, however, is shifting the ground under media companies and distributors alike.
Already, many cord-cutters are piecing together their own bundle, subscribing to a mix of services including Netflix, Max and Hulu. The deal between Disney and Charter has made it clear that cable providers -- which often provide broadband internet service -- are eager to put together streaming bundles for them.
William Rouhana, the chief executive of Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, which owns several ad-supported streaming services, said Disney's deal with Charter was proof that the traditional cable business was changing drastically.
"I think this could be the precursor to a very big shift in the industry," he said.
The winners and losers of the new game have yet to be determined. But in the short term, at least, the new bundling will probably not be as profitable as the traditional cable business, said Tom Freston, who was a member of MTV's founding team and a former chief executive of Viacom.
That spells trouble for the titans of the media industry, which are trying to milk the cash-rich cable business for as long as possible while they build streaming services to replace them, he said.
Mr. Freston noted that live sports and news programming, which have yet to be completely replicated by streaming services, remained vital to the pay-TV bundle. National Football League games, an entertainment mainstay for tens of millions of Americans, will remain on traditional television for years because of existing contracts, guaranteeing a lifeline for cable providers.
But streamers are starting to encroach on that territory, too. Amazon and YouTube are making inroads with N.F.L. fans by securing football rights, and Apple has begun to show Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer matches.
"It's hard to fight the convenience of improved technology," Mr. Freston said. "When sports and news inevitably move over to the streamers, that will be the end of the game. And what a game it was."
Still, Mr. Antoniacci, who had turned to FuboTV during the Charter-Disney face-off, said he wasn't willing to count pay TV out for good. He has been a cable subscriber for several decades, paying for television and internet access. He had been considering downgrading his cable subscription, keeping a slimmer package with access to his local news stations.
But for now, he's keeping what he had.
"This situation is making me reflect a lot on how I use these media providers," Mr. Antoniacci said.

Comedy
Aparna Nancherla
Sunday at 7:30 p.m. at the Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Brooklyn; thebellhouseny.com.
Turn on multiple streaming platforms and you can catch Aparna Nancherla adding her wit to the proceedings, from Netflix ("Space Force," "BoJack Horseman") to Peacock (NBC's "Lopez vs. Lopez") to Apple TV+ ("Central Park"), to name a few. And yet Nancherla still can feel like a bit of an outsider. Such that she's hosting a self-help interview podcast series beginning this week on Audible, "The Introvert's Survival Guide," with guests over the course of eight episodes including one of her former bosses, Seth Meyers. And next Tuesday, Viking Press will publish her book of personal essays, "Unreliable Narrator: Me, Myself, and Impostor Syndrome." Nancherla celebrates her book release with a reading and stand-up comedy performance this weekend. Tickets start at $ 20 via Eventbrite. For $ 38, your ticket includes a copy of the book. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Lauren Mayberry
Sept. 16-17 at Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn; musichallofwilliamsburg.com.
For as long as Lauren Mayberry has been in the public eye, she has shared the spotlight: For the past decade, she has performed with bandmates in the Scottish group Chvrches, lending her clarion voice to bright electro-pop. But this month, she's setting out on tour alone, and with only one song's worth of solo output to stand behind. It's an unusual move, the success of which hinges on the strength of Chvrches's fandom and Mayberry's magnetism as its frontwoman.
"Are You Awake?", Mayberry's single, is a misty piano ballad that hints at ambivalence toward success. At her tour dates so far, the song has featured in a tight setlist that includes more upbeat unreleased material and a Madonna cover. The pop upstart ggwendolyn will open Mayberry's shows at Music Hall of Williamsburg, starting at 9 p.m. on Saturday and 8 p.m. on Sunday. Saturday night is sold out, though resale tickets are available; tickets for Sunday are $ 35 on AXS. OLIVIA HORN
John Zorn and Jesse Harris: Love Songs
Sept. 16-17 at National Sawdust, 80 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn; nationalsawdust.org.
The downtown polymath John Zorn, the inexhaustible music- and scene-maker, continues his 70th birthday celebration in the Zorn-iest possible way: enlisting creative musicians for entirely unexpected projects and performances. This weekend finds Zorn, best known for his fearsome sax skronk, reuniting with Jesse Harris and Petra Haden to present a suite of honest-to-God love songs, written in the form a musical titled, yes, "Love Songs."
The songwriter and guitarist Harris, who penned book and lyrics, says that Zorn-heads may be surprised that some are written in "an old, classic style" of musical theater, while others are "are either atonal or in odd time signatures -- or both." As on the charming 2020 album "Songs for Petra," Haden sings the compositions accompanied by top-flight jazz players. Zorn will continue this creative abundance with the return of his breakneck, crowd-dazzling New Masada Quartet to the Village Vanguard the week of Sept. 26. Love Songs starts at 7:30 p.m. Saturday and 3 p.m. Sunday. Tickets are $ 44.48 to $ 49.48, including fees. ALAN SCHERSTUHL
Kids
Rosh Hashana Holiday in Prospect Park
Sept. 16-17, 10 a.m.-5 p.m., in Prospect Park, Brooklyn; prospectpark.org.
September is a good time to make new friends, including those that aren't typically met in the schoolyard.
On Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., the Prospect Park Audubon Center (near the Lincoln Road entrance) will host Nature Exploration, a program featuring the center's live-animal collection. From 11 a.m. to noon, children can see and touch an albino rat snake, an Eastern box turtle, stick bugs and a Chinese mantis. They can also observe aquatic species, like bluegill fish and an eastern river cooter turtle.
The skies promise other encounters -- the center will provide binoculars and guides for an hourlong family bird walk at noon -- while drop-in activities will investigate the bustling life below ground. Leaf Litter Discovery examines what's beneath fallen foliage, while the Decomposition Station stars an industrious group of worms.
Staying in the park all day? Nearby, the Lefferts Historic House is presenting the "J'Ouvert Genesis Immersive Experience," about West Indian carnival traditions, from noon to 4, and the park's carousel creatures will make their rounds from noon to 5.
All events are free; carousel tickets are $ 3, or $ 13 for a book of five. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
'Also Starring ... Diahann Carroll'
Sept. 15-Oct. 1 at Metrograph, 7 Ludlow Street, Manhattan; metrograph.com.
Metrograph's recurring "also starring ..." program, which focuses on actors' careers, turns to Diahann Carroll (1935-2019). She was perhaps better-known for her stage work (she won a Tony in 1962 for Richard Rodgers's musical "No Strings") and for her lead role on the sitcom "Julia" (1968-71), regarded as the first American TV series to center on the life of a Black professional woman, than for her movie appearances.
This retrospective, then, serves as a corrective. In "Paris Blues" (showing on Friday and Sunday), from 1961, Carroll plays Connie, who arrives in Paris for a vacation with a friend (Joanne Woodward) and falls for an American saxophonist (Sidney Poitier) who lives there. She thinks he is dodging the civil rights fight back home. The lineup also includes "Eve's Bayou" (on Friday and Sunday), from 1997, in which Carroll appears as a fortune teller, and "Claudine" (on Sept. 29 and Oct. 1), from 1974, in which Carroll gave an Oscar-nominated performance as a single mother in Harlem.

Alfredo Martinez, 56, Who Fused Art World And Underworld, Dies: [Biography]

Author: Traub, Alex

Publication info: Traub, Alex.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Alfredo Martinez lived on New York City's margins, a squatter who shook off one eviction after another. He was an artist who usually lacked a gallery and sometimes put on exhibits in a storage locker.
Yet Mr. Martinez was also a player in the world capital of culture and media.
He mastered a few artistic techniques. He had the chutzpah to break the rules. He saw that criminality could be a neighbor of fame. And he talked in the colorful manner that makes journalists listen.
Mr. Martinez synthesized those qualities into an idiosyncratic strategy as a bohemian provocateur: Use prison to supercharge an art career.
He did that in the early 2000s, after he pleaded guilty to art forgery. And with his guidance, Anna Sorokin transformed herself from a celebrity scammer being held in an immigration detention facility into an artist selling pencil and acrylic drawings for $ 10,000 a pop.
It was one of many ways Mr. Martinez brought together New York's art world and underworld.
He died on Aug. 21 at his home in Newark, where he had moved recently seeking space and stability, his brother, Javier, said. He was 56. Mr. Martinez had been treated for diabetes and an infection in his right leg that led to a series of amputations, beginning with his big toe and culminating above the knee.
Mr. Martinez's education in staging transgressive, carnivalesque art spectacles began when he was in his late 20s and 30s.
In 1999, the tech mogul Josh Harris offered dozens of arty acquaintances a month's room and board in a downtown Manhattan bunker in exchange for the right to film everything they did. There was sex, drugs, military-style interrogations and, surreally, a well-stocked arsenal of guns and a shooting range. Mr. Martinez, credited as the "artillery artist," set that up. (His role in the project was later recorded in "We Live in Public," a documentary by Ondi Timoner.)
Around the same time, Mr. Martinez was curating group art shows, generally drawing work from artists he knew and using ersatz galleries that did not outlive the shows themselves. In 2000, one exhibit, "Na'er Do Wells," featured some unusually valuable objects: a drawing and a painted chair back by Jean-Michel Basquiat.
Basquiat's art gave Mr. Martinez an idea.
"I just knew instinctively it was something I could forge," he told The Village Voice in 2007. "It was such an easy way to make a quick 20 grand."
Using the Basquiats that appeared in "Na'er Do Wells" and their authentication papers as models, Mr. Martinez began a forgery operation. He sold two fake Basquiats to the New York art dealer Lio Malca, Artnet reported, and he approached two other dealers with offers.
That led to his arrest. Mr. Martinez pleaded guilty to wire fraud, according to Artnet, and was sentenced to more than two years in prison.
He saw the punishment as an opportunity. "Jail," he was fond of telling journalists in the years to come, "was a publicity stunt."
During his trial and imprisonment, he became a figure on gossipy Page Six of The New York Post. In October 2003, The Post reported, Mr. Martinez "managed to smuggle his jailhouse art -- painted using coffee, Kool-Aid and fruit juice -- to a Chelsea gallery" called the Proposition Gallery. The listed price of his works was $ 150,000.
In January the next year, the writer and art critic Anthony Haden-Guest reported in New York magazine that Mr. Martinez's work had appeared in four shows, including solo exhibitions in New York and Paris.
His prison works included cartoonish but detailed drawings of guns and a portrait of himself on a hunger strike strapped to a gurney preparing to be force-fed.
Many years after his release, Mr. Martinez was still trading on the glamour of his crime, introducing himself to a journalist from Insider by saying, "I'm a notorious art forger."
By then, he had found a new opportunity for his art-crime hucksterism.
In May 2020, Anna Sorokin was in the midst of a 4-to-12-year prison sentence for financial crimes. She had been the subject of magazine profiles, tabloid gossip and news coverage for posing as a German heiress named Anna Delvey and swindling banks, hotels and associates out of about $ 200,000. Now she had begun doing something new: having her friends post on Instagram self-portraits that she had drawn in prison.
Julia Morrison, a friend of Mr. Martinez's and a fellow artist, showed him Ms. Sorokin's work, pointing out that, like Mr. Martinez, Ms. Sorokin was a con artist turned artist.
They tried reaching out to her.
"It was impossible to get ahold of her," Mr. Martinez told Insider, speaking of Ms. Sorokin. "So what I did was, I planted some story in Page Six to get her attention."
In March 2021, while Ms. Sorokin was on parole, Page Six announced that "noted artist and curator Alfredo Martinez" had "fallen in love" with Ms. Sorokin's drawings.
Now Ms. Sorokin replied to Ms. Morrison and Mr. Martinez. The group began planning an exhibit.
Days after the Post article came out, Immigration and Customs Enforcement took Ms. Sorokin into custody for overstaying her visa. She faced the same difficulty that Mr. Martinez once had in making art while incarcerated. He came up with a solution: printing out images of her works and copying them, using the same tracing method with which he had forged Basquiat.
On March 17 last year -- soon after the release of "Inventing Anna," a Netflix mini-series about Ms. Sorokin -- a crowd of skateboarders, party people, curiosity seekers, contemporary art fans and journalists gathered in a shuttered downtown Manhattan storefront. It was a classic Alfredo Martinez group show and art spectacle.
"Free Anna Delvey!" the crowd chanted.
Ms. Sorokin called Mr. Martinez. He put her on speaker and held his phone aloft. Ms. Morrison told the crowd to shut up and listen.
Mr. Martinez smiled. Once again, he had New York's attention.
Alfredo Martinez was born on April 15, 1967, in Brooklyn, to Alfredo and Sonia (Pereyra) Martinez. The family ran a junk store in Brooklyn, and they lived behind the store. Alfredo ran away from home as a teenager.
In addition to his brother, Mr. Martinez is survived by his father and two sisters, Sonia and Christine Martinez.
Some who followed Mr. Martinez's career called him a publicity hound. Curators asking around about him were advised to stay away. Even friends like Ms. Morrison often found themselves feeling exploited.
But it's not hard to find people eager to discuss not only Mr. Martinez's chicanery and showmanship, but also his artwork itself.
One of Mr. Martinez's preoccupations was making aluminum casts of pistols, revolvers and machine guns; it was among his techniques for using gun parts to create menacing yet toylike sculptures. In an interview, Mr. Haden-Guest called them "genuinely peculiar and unusual."
He added that Mr. Martinez might turn out to fit a familiar type: the troublemaker who posthumously gains renown as a serious artist.
"An artist with an unruly kind of life, a street life, who people find hard to accept in their lives -- bang, when they're dead, they're there," he said. "They're part of art history."

Full text: Shao took a novel approach to attracting an audience for its debut.
How far would you go to get attention for your work?
It is notoriously hard to be a young designer, or even an independent designer. It's no longer enough just to make good stuff or have an original idea. You need to break through the noise long enough to grab the focus of the fractured world so people (the ones who may wear your clothes, or buy them, or post about them on Instagram or TikTok) look long enough and closely enough to notice what is special.
Some designers, like Piotrek Panszczyk of Area, do it by being as blingtastically absurd as possible, attracting an audience willing to gussy themselves up in rhinestone bikinis and sheer body stockings in the light of day. What better look for taking selfies while applauding a meditation on the cave man nature of capitalism via Krystle Carrington puffers made to look like minks and crystal gowns with jutting femurs between the seams?
Others do it with noise, like LaQuan Smith, who doused his bass notes and bombast in light blue this season and added a wind machine but otherwise stuck to his usual bodylicious script.
But until this season no one has done it with the help of a notorious society grifter and fake German heiress currently under house arrest.
On Monday, Anna Delvey (real name Sorokin), who became famous for conning a swath of New York rich, was later immortalized by Julia Garner in a Netflix series and served almost four years in prison, was a co-host of the fashion show debut of Shao, a genderless suiting-meets-streetwear-meets-corsetry label founded by Shao Yang.
And she didn't just lend her (fake) name to the invitation: She lent her address too, co-hosting the event at her East Village walk-up. (Well, until her immigration case is resolved, Ms. Sorokin can't leave the building.) Actually, it was on the silver-painted tar-papered roof of her East Village walk-up. Her apartment is too small for a fashion show.
The show was the brainchild of Kelly Cutrone, a fashion publicist who was the subject of the 2010 Bravo reality show "Kell on Earth." Ms. Cutrone had invited Ms. Sorokin to team up on a "pop-up P.R. agency" they christened OutLaw (really), the better to exploit her brand equity for the benefit of someone else -- and, perhaps, start rehabbing her reputation at the same time. Ms. Sorokin does, after all, have a history in understanding the way fashion could be used to manipulate those around her.
"It's so hard for new designers to get any attention, and I can just get publicity -- bad publicity, any publicity, just for taking out garbage," Ms. Sorokin said before the show, sitting in her apartment, which was jammed with a film crew from Germany making a documentary on her life, the same way her fridge is jammed with LaCroix seltzers. Not that she is really shying away from the publicity. (She does still call herself Delvey.) "We're just trying to channel it into something positive," she said.
The fairly cynical theory: Sure, the fashion world would come for the novelty of gawking at the co-host, but at least they'd come. And if they came, they'd have to see the clothes.
The plan worked, to a certain extent. Olivier Zahm, the ever-white-jeaned editor of Purple magazine, was there, eyeing the scene from behind his trademark tinted aviators. So was the pop singer Slayyyter. So was Nicola Formichetti, Lady Gaga's collaborator, who had moved back to New York from Los Angeles just three days before. He said that even though he hadn't been to a fashion show for a while, he came for Anna because "I've been fascinated with her for so long and been waiting for what she's going to do next, like everyone else." He also said he thought the name of the pop-up agency was "genius." (Ms. Sorokin said she thought it was "funny.")
Mr. Formichetti, along with a motley gang of black-clad fashion people who had gathered outside the building on First Avenue, huffed up the six flights of stairs to the roof. There were about 100 guests, Ms. Cutrone said. The models, one of whom was toting a fuzzy little dog that had been dyed pink, arrived by party bus since there wasn't enough room in Ms. Sorokin's apartment for hair and makeup.
Once inside, they crammed into the narrow hallways waiting for their turn on the roof (they posed against the egress door). One of Ms. Sorokin's neighbors, who had apparently not been alerted about what was happening and was somewhat startled by the crowd when she arrived home with her groceries, asked everyone to please be quiet so as not to scare her dog. Then Guns N' Roses started to blast from the speakers set up on the roof.
"It's a bit intrusive," Ms. Sorokin admitted, having all these strangers in her building. "But I've also been to jail, and it's really intrusive there too. We'll clean it up." Anyway, her lease was about to be up, she said, and she was going to have to move. Ms. Sorokin was wearing a Shao black tuxedo with legs long enough to hide her ankle monitor and shoulders encrusted with rhinestones. She materialized briefly on the roof to welcome everyone and pose for photos before going back inside. The tux was something of a preview of the collection, which had a Gaultier-meets-Off-White vibe in black and white and highlighter yellow. Ms. Yang, whose family emigrated from Taiwan when she was 5, graduated from Parsons and has spent the last nine years running the Tailory, a custom suit company. She knows what she is doing.
"Not everyone would be cool with it -- with us, probably, getting more attention than their work," Ms. Sorokin acknowledged. Some might also not be cool with knowing that the first thing most people know about their work is an association with a famous scammer.
Others, however, might say it's exactly the place fashion, an industry with famously fungible morals that tends to the Warholian and finds it impossible to resist the siren call of social media, has been heading.
"There are no more rules," Ms. Cutrone said. "All bets are off now."

‘Wrestlers’ Is Greg Whiteley’s Latest Underdog Tale

When Greg Whiteley was 19 he ventured from his hometown, Bellevue, Washington, to spread the word of the Mormon church on Navajo reservations in the Southwest. At first he would come in hot, as the kids say, eager to knock on doors and proselytize.
“Frequently the thing I’d ask was, ‘Do you have time to hear a message about Jesus Christ today?’” he recalled during a video interview earlier this month from his Southern California home. “And the answer 99 times out of 100 was, ‘No, I do not have time for that.’ I think I spent the first months of my mission talking at people, and it was a very discouraging experience.”
Gradually, however, he learned to shut up and listen. “I was amazed at how quickly people would disclose the most vulnerable things at a doorstep within 90 seconds of meeting them,” Whiteley said. He didn’t realize it at the time, but he was preparing himself for a successful career as a documentary filmmaker.
Today, Whiteley, 53, is best known for creating, producing and directing immersive, off-the-beaten-path underdog sports docuseries for Netflix, including “Last Chance U,” “Cheer” and his latest, “Wrestlers,” which premiered Wednesday. All are notable for what they are not: manipulative, sensationalist, opportunistic.
Whiteley finds subjects that offer maximum access and editorial control. “It’s really hard to get that from the New England Patriots,” he said. In other words, this isn’t “Hard Knocks,” the HBO series that purports to offer revealing behind-the-scenes stories from NFL training camps. For “Last Chance U,” which premiered in 2016, Whiteley focuses on individual community college football and basketball teams. In “Cheer,” the subject is a Texas community college cheerleading squad that happens to be a national dynasty. And for “Wrestlers,” Whiteley and his 20-person crew descended upon Ohio Valley Wrestling, a scrappy, underfunded professional wrestling company, with a passionate, blue-collar fan base, based in Louisville, Kentucky. Famous OVW alumni include John Cena and Paul Wight (who wrestled as Big Show), but the company has maintained an authentic little-guy personality.
“Wrestlers” is vintage Whiteley. He identified a few dynamic lead characters, including Al Snow, the fiercely dedicated, disarmingly thoughtful former WWF (later the WWE) wrestler and current minority owner and day-to-day manager of OVW, who sees wrestling as a means of telling great stories preferably for television; Matt Jones, the aggressively opinionated OVW co-owner and sports radio personality, focused on touring and keeping the company afloat financially; and HollyHood Haley J, a rebellious (and often irresponsible) young wrestler who is one of OVW’s most popular performers and drives Snow mad with her propensity to smoke weed on the gym premises.
Whiteley and his crew settled in and familiarized themselves with the rhythms of the operation. Perhaps most important, he quickly established that he wasn’t trying to burn anyone or manufacture the gotcha moments that fuel reality TV, which those on both sides of the camera are adamant that “Wrestlers” is not.
“There was a great deal of trust,” Snow said in a video interview from his home office. “Professional wrestling as a whole has always been a very closed, very secular business, never open, especially not to the general public and especially not in this manner. It was a tough decision for me to let this happen and be involved in it. But meeting Greg I really got the idea and the impression that he was going to treat it with respect and he was going to be honest.”
The trust is largely a byproduct of Whiteley’s patience. He doesn’t push things, preferring instead to burrow in and hang out and get to know his subjects; “Wrestlers” was shot over a period of 3 1/2 months. His ideal is to disappear, or at least create the illusion that he has. He wants his three camera teams constantly rolling film — unless his subjects tell them to stop, in which case they generally do. This, in turn, reinforces the trust level. He tells stories by spending countless hours with his characters, not by asking hot-take questions about drug abuse and romantic problems (both of which are present in “Wrestlers”).
Snow, who in the series likens himself to Kermit the Frog presiding over “The Muppet Show,” emerges as a sort of tormented showbiz impresario. He’s like a Broadway director in an old Hollywood musical, agonizing until the final curtain goes down, at which point he starts agonizing anew. The primary tension in “Wrestlers” simmers between Snow, the professional wrestling purist, and Jones, the entrepreneur focused on the bottom line. It doesn’t seem like the most obvious angle, but Whiteley has a gift for finding gold in the unobvious, in this case a conflict outside the ring that turns into a battle for the soul of OVW.
“Credit to Greg, he sniffed that out,” said Adam Leibowitz, a producer who has been working with Whiteley since “Mitt” (2014), Whiteley’s documentary portrait of Mitt Romney’s unsuccessful bids for president in 2008 and 2012.
“When you’re presented with a project like this, you think it’s going to be about funny wrestlers and their crazy costumes and their personalities,” Leibowitz continued. “Yes that’s great, and that’s a part of it. But for all of us, it was the tension between Al and Matt that really made this show super interesting, to have this almost Shakespearean battle between these two completely different personalities over this little gym.”
Whiteley traces his patient approach not just to his missionary work, but also to a lesson absorbed from an old-school master of cinéma vérité. He first encountered the work of Frederick Wiseman as a film student at Brigham Young University. Then, when Whiteley was making “New York Doll,” his 2005 documentary about New York Dolls bassist Arthur “Killer” Kane, he saw Wiseman’s “Public Housing,” an epic look at a Chicago housing project. He was struck by how Wiseman would wait a few beats after a question was answered, a process that often yielded some of the film’s most unguarded moments. Whiteley tried the approach with Kane, at one point asking if he was nervous about an upcoming reunion concert. No, Kane insisted, of course not. Then he stared straight ahead saying nothing, looking very nervous.
“I’ve never quite had Wiseman’s courage to let situations breathe for as long as they’ll breathe,” Whiteley said. “But I do know I let them breathe longer than I would have had I not seen ‘Public Housing.’ And some of my favorite moments that we have ever filmed have occurred because we’re not cutting yet. Just stay on this moment.”
He also likes to zoom in on characters who don’t seem to be trying out for the camera. For instance, he was fascinated by the swagger and authenticity of HollyHood Haley J, whose real name is Haley Marie James and who wrestles with and against her mother, Amazing Maria (Tina Marie Evans James). Haley, for her part, didn’t seem to care much about the project, even blowing off scheduled interviews.
“I had an attitude at times, and Greg handled me very well,” Haley said in a video interview from her home in Louisville. “It was all new to me, especially them following me around. I’d try to run and hide and get away from everyone. And then here comes Greg with the camera.”
Whiteley is always after what is real, which in this case sets up a rich irony: a painstakingly authentic look at an endeavor often derided for being fake. But for all of their veracity, Whiteley’s projects also make for fine drama, generating high real-life stakes, off the field as much as on, that go well beyond famous athletes winning big games and matches. None of the wrestlers in “Wrestlers” are getting rich. The kids in the various iterations of “Last Chance U” are just hoping to catch on with a four-year college, or merely graduate and get a decent job. These are very human stories about people just trying to get by.
Whitely wouldn’t have it any other way.
“We really only have one gear as a company,” he said. “Let’s just tell the true story.”

Representing in the Office Can Be an Absolute Horror: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Two new series about young culture-industry workers, "The Other Black Girl" and "Dreaming Whilst Black," explore how representation can be a challenge -- or even a horror story.
Early in Hulu's "The Other Black Girl," Nella (Sinclair Daniel), an editorial assistant at the august and very white publishing company Wagner Books, is delighted to meet Hazel (Ashleigh Murray), the new hire to whom the title refers. Her enthusiasm won't last -- more on that later -- but she's happy, not just at the prospect of a new friend but also at no longer being looked on in the office as the sole voice and manifestation of an entire race.
"It's like Wagner realized we're in 2023 and there can no longer just be one of us," she says.
She's talking publishing, but she could be talking TV as well. When a series is the sole depiction of a certain demographic of character in a certain setting, it can become a prisoner of representation, taken to depict "the [insert group here] experience" rather than representing simply an experience, distinct and personal.
So it's fitting that "The Other Black Girl" isn't alone. It's one of two ambitious new series about young Black culture workers, in different countries and with different goals, dealing with the tension between representing one's people and representing one's self.
The British import "Dreaming Whilst Black," on Showtime, follows the aspiring filmmaker Kwabena (Adjani Salmon, who cocreated the series and the web comedy it is adapted from). He has written a feature script, a romance based on his grandparents' experience as Jamaican immigrants, but he is stuck in an office job while his film school friends get into, or at least closer to, the movie business.
Though it is about a struggling artist, "Dreaming" is not an avant-garde production but rather a deft combination of young-adult rom-com and workplace cringe comedy. Kwabena's white co-worker asks him to recommend "Black films" for a Netflix-and-chill date with a Black woman; his friend Amy (Dani Moseley) works in a production office where her white colleagues see her as "our voice of the African community." Amy's office dynamics, in particular, recall the foot-in-mouth workplace microaggressions in Issa Rae's "Insecure."
"Dreaming" leaves Kwabena's films largely offscreen. It's less a story about moviemaking than about movie-pitching -- selling your ideas and yourself to people with preconceptions about both -- and this social aspect of the film business makes for both better comedy and better commentary.
Salmon is a charismatic anchor for the series, which sends the easygoing but hapless Kwabena through a gantlet of "pitchfests," film showcases and one-off video gigs, while building out his small circle of family and friends. If anything, "Dreaming" can be too conventional a comedy, relying on conventions like its abundant fantasy sequences.
But it gets weirder and more distinctive over the season's six episodes, as Kwabena struggles to hold on to his vision in an industry that has set ideas of what "Black film" looks like. "I don't want to be another director making hood films," he tells a colleague, who answers, "If you want to be a filmmaker, you need to be making films."
Like Kwabena, "Dreaming Whilst Black" takes its purpose seriously but carries it lightly. It finds multiple angles on its central question: Can you represent a people while also representing yourself individually -- and without betraying either? It has no pat answers, ending its first season on an unresolved note that had me eager to see a second.
"The Other Black Girl," based on a novel by Zakiya Dalila Harris, is likewise a mash-up but of different components. It's part literary-world dramedy, part conspiracy thriller and part horror tale. Much of its appeal comes in watching the protagonist work out exactly what kind of story she's living in.
A centerpiece of Nella's office is the "hall of white people," lined with portraits of past editors, which includes a single Black face, an industry legend who shepherded a literary classic by her childhood friend to publication, then disappeared in the late 1980s.
Nella imagines taking her place on that wall, but her job involves navigating awkward co-workers (like an anxious try-hard "ally" who seems to have reread "White Fragility" a few dozen too many times) and salving the ego of a big-shot author (Brian Baumgartner) whose latest manuscript focuses on a stereotyped Black drug addict named "Shartricia."
Nella's excitement at meeting Hazel -- hip, outgoing, someone she can bond with over college experiences -- curdles when Nella raises concerns over the offensive manuscript and Hazel throws her under the bus. Maybe Hazel is reacting out of nerves. Maybe she is out to take Nella's place. Maybe, as suggested by Hazel's odd behavior and mysterious background, there are bigger, more sinister -- even supernatural? -- forces at work.
"The Other Black Girl" is open about its screen influences, referencing Shonda Rhimes and Jordan Peele. But its foundation is a smart, brisk satire of the supposedly progressive office of the Black Lives Matter era, as well a subtler comedy of intraracial dynamics and frenemyship. Daniel is vibrant as Nella, who is just cynical enough to suspect everything and everyone, just idealistic enough to be vulnerable in office politics.
Hazel, meanwhile, is as much a thought-provoking mystery as she is an intriguing character. In the early episodes, she is as plausible a friend for Nella as she is an enemy. She says all the right things about sisterhood. She's cool and savvy, quickly embraced by the white staff whom Nella has never been entirely comfortable with. You (and Nella) have to wonder, Is Hazel the real villain here? Or is it the institution that puts them in a "Highlander"-style competition in which, 2023 or not, there can only be one?
After a few episodes, "The Other Black Girl" starts working toward an answer, and a tart office dramedy morphs into -- well, here is where things get both spoilery and bananas. With the help of her friend Malaika (Brittany Adebumola) and boyfriend, Owen (Hunter Parrish), Nella delves into Hazel's secrets as well as the twisty history of the company and its founder (Eric McCormack, who doesn't quite manage the smarmy scariness the role calls for), which reach back decades.
The mounting shockers begin to evoke Rhimes's "Scandal," whose Bellamy Young appears as Nella's boss. But "The Other Black Girl" is grounded in real-world conflicts: Whether it's possible to change institutions from within, whether success requires so much compromise that it becomes another form of failure.
I haven't read the novel the series is based on -- I'm a believer that a good adaptation needs to stand on its own, as this one mostly does -- but it is worth noting that Hulu intends it to be a continuing series. Where a limited-series version of the story might have ended on a note of productive ambiguity, it's hard to see how "Black Girl" can continue the story without leaning even harder into its corkboard-and-string elements.
As TV, "The Other Black Girl" ends up being an entertaining, sometimes jarring mix of realist satire and over-the-top thriller. It's both the thing itself -- a story about representation, compromise and the way in which members of a minority group are pitted against one another -- and a fantastical, sometimes out-of-control allegory for that thing.
Maybe it's inevitable that the down-to-earth aspects of the series are not only more successful but also scarier. Sometimes reality is all the horror story you need.

That Feeling of Emptiness Remains Untreated: [Style Desk]

Full text: As a married gay man and an emergency pediatrician, I continue to wrestle with expectations of having a 'traditional' family life.
A few years ago, while I was completing my pediatrics residency, I spent a month working in the newborn nursery. Each day, our team gathered in a narrow corridor on the fourth floor of the county hospital and looked through a tall pane of glass into a room full of babies. Nurses would clean and change them, and then we would do our exams and write our notes.
When the babies cried, we would hold them until they quieted. The room filled and emptied, babies coming in and out all day, their wheeled bassinets arranged in haphazard rows like shopping carts left out in an empty parking lot.
One day, on a slow morning with only one laboring mother on the board, we did our rounds with the attending pediatrician, decided who would do circumcisions, who was too jaundiced and needed to start phototherapy. A nurse gave me a baby to hold, and I balanced him in one hand while checking off vitals with the other.
There were a few newborn exams to do, notes to write. I ate lunch in the cafeteria and then did some discharges, watching young parents beaming (yet terrified) at the small bundle in their arms as they disappeared down the hall and through the elevator doors. My attending let me go home early, so I left.
I breezed through the early afternoon traffic. At home I ate a snack and watched Netflix on my computer until my husband arrived. He asked me how my day was, and I said it was fine. Then I walked up to him for a hug, fell into his arms, and cried.
Part of me hadn't left the nursery, and it broke me, to be close and yet so far from parenthood. Although I was holding my husband, my arms still held the weight of the baby I was carrying just hours before, forcing me to consider a life I had never let myself feel I deserved.
One of the reasons I didn't come out as gay until I was 27 was that I didn't want to give up the idea of having a wife. At 33, I have learned to let that go, the faceless woman I've carried around in my mind for so long. I recognize her now as an embodiment of everything I was at risk of losing if I ever let my secret slip: a traditional marriage and family, including the notion of fatherhood, or at least how I was taught to perceive it -- schoolyard logic that's been seared into my mind in which there can't exist a father without a mother, or a mother without a father, or a child without either of them.
"There are other ways," my husband told me one day.
We talk about children sporadically, during commercial breaks of "RuPaul's Drag Race" or between bites of food while we're eating dinner. He doesn't mean to be cryptic, but, regardless, I know what he's saying -- we're fortunate to have options. But it's hard for me to seriously consider them. It's so easy to get overwhelmed. The money, the ethics, the lawyers.
I imagine interviewing surrogates and egg donors -- more faceless women haunting my mind -- trying to glean an entire genome from a conversation, appraising traits as I would the ingredients of a cake, balancing a family history of diabetes or glaucoma with blue or brown eyes, light or dark hair, left-handedness, autism, height, a penchant for math.
Sometimes I'm envious of the way parenthood seems to have been passed around among everyone I know, pervasive as a cold, and how, for many, the formula for having children could be something so simple as the product of sex over time.
My father tells me whenever he meets a gay couple who have children -- a gentle prod from the grandfather in him -- and there's a certain heaviness I'm left with when he's done, a reminder of how I'm different, of all the things I grew up believing that no longer pertain to me.
He noticed that heaviness once when we were on the phone, after he had told me about a couple who had recently gone through the adoption process and were still, a full year later, waiting for their son to arrive. After he explained it all to me, he paused for a moment, then said, "You know, it seems like one of the most unromantic things in the world."
Before starting my residency, I asked my therapist if it was OK for me to be gay and a pediatrician. He looked pained at my question, and I immediately regretted having asked it. I was on the cusp of coming out and unsure of so many things, interpreting shame as perversion, attraction as fetish.
I used to volunteer to teach Sunday school at my church, and one time I noticed the pastor staring at me from the doorway while I carried a boy to the top of a plastic slide. I tried to acknowledge him, but he didn't say anything. He just continued staring, his lips pressed together as if he were trying to decide something.
I knew that look. I had seen it before and have seen it since, always amid an uneasy silence, as if there might be something on me, something ugly and despicable, that somehow everybody but me can see.
I get fewer of those looks now that I'm a pediatrician, which is perhaps why I studied medicine in the first place, my interactions with others scaffolded within the confines of the doctor-patient relationship. I've always been good with roles, the affirmation of a job well done providing the validation I never felt I deserved. And children often see roles more than people -- father, mother, stranger, friend -- which is maybe why I feel so comfortable around them.
At times, I feel like I'm a better clinician for my ability to focus on my role more than myself, to see the child as a patient, their tears and screaming symptoms of an illness rather than emotions of distress. But there are other times, usually small moments in a quiet day, when it hits me, the emptiness from having ignored myself for so long, times when I recognize the life before me, a newborn baby small enough to fit in my hands, and I imagine a future where something so precious and so loved could possibly feel at home with someone like me.
It has been harder for me to want to have children since becoming a pediatrician. Admittedly, my perspective is skewed. I have been trained to expect bronchiolitis at every corner, pneumonia and sepsis a constant threat. I have seen skin broken too many times for chest tubes, burr holes, wound packing and nerve blocks, pudgy arms and legs poked for blood draws, fluids and antibiotics.
My niece and nephew are toddlers, both unstoppable, and it's always an adjustment when I see them, how little they need me, how capable they are, how fragile they aren't.
Especially after starting my fellowship in pediatric emergency medicine, experience has taught me to anticipate disaster. There's a running joke among my colleagues that takes the form of a growing list of all the things we'll never let our children do: eating uncut grapes or hot dogs, riding ATVs and visiting a trampoline park.
It's a joke because we take it to an unfathomable extreme, each item laughable only when it is far enough removed from the tragedy it came from, the lesson learned too late that nothing -- no one -- is ever truly ours.
I have my own list that I share in these moments, despite my ambivalence about parenthood. It's a way of having children without having children, a way of blending in, which is something I have become expert at. A part of me tells myself that this should be enough, these brief glimpses I get into the lives of my patients, as if, held end to end, they constitute something real to cherish.
But that voice is just an echo of the ones I have heard whispered behind my back many times before, an accompaniment to the puzzling stares telling me that the world hasn't decided quite yet if I'm able to be trusted.
A few months ago, I met with a boy who had come to the emergency room for painful urination. He was 16, and when I explained to him and his parents that I would have to examine his genitals, he balked.
"He's a doctor; he's just doing his job," his father said. And then, as if to reassure his son further, he added, "It's not like he's gay or anything."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Whenever I take my young researchers on celebrity interviews, I give them the Warning: No matter how well you hit it off, don't feel bad if you ever run into the stars again and they act as though they don't know you. That's usually how it goes. Think of them as elusive, shimmering creatures from another planet.
One of the few exceptions to this rule was Jimmy Buffett.
I don't think I ever met anyone as warm. He had no airs. One night, Carl Hulse, our chief Washington correspondent, and I were out at dinner with him here -- he loved to pump us for the latest info -- and an inebriated woman interrupted him and declared, "You're not Jimmy Buffett!" With that euphoric smile that could light up an arena, he pulled out his driver's license for her.
Maybe he liked reporters because he started as a journalist, writing for Billboard magazine. He thought of himself as a writer -- not only of songs but also of best-selling books; he was one of just a few to scale both the fiction and nonfiction lists at The Times. It was more than that, though. He was blessed with an irresistible Southern, devil-may-care charm. Usually, joie de vivre is a sign you're not paying attention. But with Jimmy, it was ensorcelling. I went with him to Walter Reed medical center when he sang for wounded Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. He was able to transport them to a beach with no cares. During the Covid years, he did "cabin fever Zooms" with health care workers from across the country who were Parrotheads.
We both loved pirates, mermaids, jukeboxes and the glamorous era of Pan Am flight attendants, and we built a friendship on those mythical objects. When I asked him when his birthday was, so I could send him a Pan Am sweatshirt I'd found, he replied: "I'll give you a hint. Same day as the baby in the manger, but I was not born in a manger. I was born in Pascagoula." As he was dying, said his brother-in-law, the writer Tom McGuane, he was talking about going home to Pascagoula, Miss.
His druggie past was not something to emulate, although he said he had no regrets. As he sang in "He Went to Paris," "Some of it's magic, some of it's tragic, but I had a good life all the way." But in one sense at least, he was a model for how to live: Build your life around what you love. When he was a young scalawag, he found the Life Aquatic and conjured his art from it, making Key West the capital of Margaritaville. He didn't waste away there; he spun a billion-dollar empire out of a shaker of salt. What could be more American than that?
In the end, having packed a thousand lifetimes into one, he was a model for how to die.
"Well, I have learned one thing from my latest in a series of the ever-appearing speed bumps of life -- 75 is NOT the new 50," he emailed me. "Thinking younger doesn't quite do it. You still have to do the hard work of, as the Toby Keith song says, 'Don't let the old man in.' And that is my job now, the way I see it."
Some stars are such natural performers, they don't look as though they're working very hard. Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe never won Oscars. Jimmy was not garlanded with awards. He sent me his thoughts on that last April, on the occasion of "Margaritaville" being enshrined as "culturally significant" in the Library of Congress, sharing what he had told Howard Cohen, a Miami Herald reporter.
Jimmy loved the Library of Congress and visited it often back in the days when he was working on a musical, "Don't Stop the Carnival," with Herman Wouk, holed up at Wouk's house in Georgetown. (The musical had a brief run in Miami in 1997.)
"I have always loved books, reading and libraries, a gift from my mother," Jimmy said. "The Library of Congress is a monumental treasure you don't have to dig up; you just walk in the door of American history. 'Margaritaville' in the Library of Congress. I just have to giggle, but with pride. I haven't received many awards in my profession, but I am OK with that. I think the best reward for a performer is to please the audience."
He offered the story of how he came to write his biggest hit: "I started writing it on a napkin in a Mexican restaurant in Austin, Texas, with a friend who was driving me to the airport, to fly home to Key West. On the drive down the Keys, there was a fender bender on the Seven Mile Bridge, west of Marathon, and I was stuck, overlooking Pigeon Key. I sat on the bridge for about an hour and finished the song there. That night, I played it for the first time at my job at Crazy Ophelia's on Duval Street. The small crowd in the bar asked me to play it again. And I did. So, I guess it is a pretty good three-minute song that has stood the test of time."
He was well-read but unpretentious. When I told him I was getting my master's in English at Columbia University, he dryly asked, "Did 'y'all' ever make it into the English books?" One of his favorite signoffs was "Let's ketchup soon." I wrote to tell him about a course at Columbia on grammar and syntax called The Comma Sutra. "I need it, and maybe one on semicolons," he replied. "Would that then be semicolonography? JB."
A passionate Democrat -- I met him through Caroline Kennedy -- Jimmy despised Donald Trump but made sure his shows were "an oasis" for fans of any political stripe.
Privately, he referred to the Trump era as "the Big Cheeto Follies" and told me he hoped I was "having fun sticking pins into the Trump voodoo doll." Watching "My Octopus Teacher" on Netflix during the pandemic, Jimmy noted -- with an octopus emoji -- that the inquisitive cephalopod in the film was "way smarter than Trump."
Jimmy asked if the Trump impeachment for demanding a quid pro quo from Ukraine would be "the rotten piece of bait that finally hooks this sleazy bottom feeder? I hope so. Smart people seem to learn from their mistakes and move on. Something the bottom feeder never got."
When Trump trundled back into the arena in 2022, Jimmy recoiled: "He never figured out that no show lasts forever, and it looks like this will be the last season, thank God." Always the optimist.
He wrote happily about "Uncle Joe": "Looks like I am welcome back at this White House. I have known Joe a long time, and his favorite song is 'Come Monday.' I am honored. OK, sun's up, and the wind is down. Off to surf. JB."
His texts and emails came from many locales in paradise -- St. Barth's, Sag Harbor, Palm Beach, Paris and Cojímar, a small fishing village in Cuba.
But in the last couple of years, he often wrote from less exotic places, Boston and Houston, where he was being treated for an aggressive form of skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma. (Was there a price for trademarking the sun? Even so, I bet he wouldn't have changed a thing.) He stayed upbeat on the "juice," as he called his infusions to treat the cancer, and spoke proudly about his "all-female doctor team dedicated to keeping the old man out" on the road. He would say he had to "go into the pits for some adjustments" and reassure me that he was getting "weller." He called it an irritation, a Southern fingernail on an English chalkboard.
He said he was burrowing in at his Sag Harbor house with his wife, Janie, and his kids and dogs. His younger sister, Laurie, who also was battling cancer, came around. He loved having his band members over to play music, calling it "therapeutic to me." He talked about binging on "The White Lotus" and sent the titles of new songs he was working on that were so Jimmy: "Conch Fritters and Red Wine," "Fish Porn" and "My Gummy Just Kicked In," which featured a turn by his Hamptons pal Paul McCartney.
Jimmy urged me to keep after the bad guys. "Keep trolling out there; as a longtime fisherman, I can say with some authority, you never know what is going to wind up on the end of your rod. Fins up and see you soon."

Kering's Chief Strikes Deal For the Talent Agency CAA: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The deal for Creative Artists Agency by François-Henri Pinault's family office reflects the growing convergence of celebrities and fashion.
In a deal that shows the ever-growing convergence of fashion and fame, François-Henri Pinault, the French billionaire and chief executive of the luxury goods company Kering, said on Thursday that his family office had bought a majority stake in one of Hollywood's biggest talent agencies, Creative Artists Agency.
Mr. Pinault's family office, Artémis, already has investments that include the auction house Christie's and a stake in Puma. Like them, CAA will be managed separately from Kering, which owns such brands as Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga.
Talent -- actors, singers, filmmakers -- has become a uniquely powerful tool in selling products. Celebrities, be they actors, athletes or social media stars, give a brand direct access to legions of followers and are handsomely paid for that access. Fashion brands are increasingly racing to lock in relationships with the next big name.
"There's no separation between fashion and entertainment anymore," said Robert Burke, the eponymous founder of a luxury consultancy, calling the deal a "natural, if unprecedented, evolution."
CAA's clients include some of the biggest celebrities: Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and Zendaya -- as well as Mr. Pinault's wife, the actress Salma Hayek Pinault, who is often next to her husband in the front row of fashion shows, and who often wears Gucci and Balenciaga gowns on the red carpet.
The deal offers Artémis "increased diversity, both in terms of geographical footprint and business activities, to our other assets," Mr. Pinault said in a statement. "CAA's exceptional insight, relationships and access across key sectors, combined with their widely regarded level of collaboration and innovation, gives the company a formidable role in driving global opportunities."
CAA has been led by the powerhouse team of Bryan Lourd, Kevin Huvane and Richard Lovett, and they will remain as chairmen, according to a news release about the deal. Mr. Lourd will be named chief executive when the deal closes.
Along with the appointment of the music producer Pharrell Williams as creative director of Louis Vuitton men's wear, the CAA acquisition reflects just how important access to celebrity has become to the fashion world -- and how important fashion is to celebrities. Especially during the actors' strike, as commercial work with brands remains one of the few avenues of income and profile-raising that the union, SAG-AFTRA, approves.
In 2010, the private equity firm TPG took a 35 percent stake in CAA, then broadened its hold on the talent agency to 53 percent four years later. Artémis is acquiring that majority stake, according to the news release, though it did not specify the price.
The agency's rivals, meanwhile, have raced to scale up to strengthen their negotiating power with streaming powerhouses like Amazon, Netflix and Apple.
United Talent Agency, which represents celebrities like Chris Pratt, Bad Bunny and Lizzo, bought the literary agency Fletcher & Company in January after acquiring the London-based Curtis Brown agency last year. The Endeavor Group, a CAA rival, acquired full control of the wrestling business Ultimate Fighting Championship in 2021 ahead of Endeavor's initial public offering. This year, Endeavor struck a deal to merge UFC with World Wide Wrestling as part of a new company.
As these talent agencies grow -- and further intertwine themselves with fashion -- new questions may emerge about the nature of these relationships. Even if the new CAA is separate from Kering, for example, would LVMH, the world's dominant luxury group, want to pay millions to celebrities to represent its brands when it knows that a percentage of that payment will enrich a company with a relationship to its competitor?
After all, "even if it's managed separately, this offers enormous access to talent," Mr. Burke said.
The CAA acquisition is the latest in a series of moves from Mr. Pinault. This year, Kering bought a 30 percent stake in Valentino, the Roman fashion brand and red carpet staple, with an option to acquire the whole thing by 2028. That deal followed the Kering purchase of Creed, the high-end fragrance brand, for $ 3.83 billion.
And Kering itself has also ventured into film. Saint Laurent became the first luxury fashion brand with a movie subsidiary when it introduced Saint Laurent Productions in April; its debut short, directed by Pedro Almodóvar, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May. (Kering became an official partner of the film festival in 2015.)
As to whether other luxury moguls might follow Mr. Pinault's lead and look to acquire their own talent agency, Mr. Burke added, "I'm never surprised by anyone in fashion following someone else's smart idea."

This Filmmaker Was Going for 'Dorky': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Movies are full of glamorous hit men. For "The Killer," the director put his star in a bucket hat: "The $ 3,000 suit seems like it's played out."
It's been 24 years since David Fincher brought one of his movies to the Venice Film Festival, and the last time, things didn't go so well.
"I came here with a little film called 'Fight Club"' in 1999, he told me during an interview on the Lido this week. "We were fairly run out of town for being fascists." Even before the premiere of that controversial Brad Pitt flick, the director could sense trouble. "I looked down and the youngest person in our row was Giorgio Armani," Fincher said. "I was like, 'I'm not sure the guest list is the right guest list for this."'
So what makes lofty Venice the right place to premiere "The Killer," Fincher's new thriller and his first film since the Oscar-winning Hollywood drama "Mank"?
"Nothing," cracked Fincher. "Venice seems like it's very highbrow -- important movies about important subjects -- and then there's our skeevy little movie."
Still, Fincher has always enjoyed toying with people's expectations. He does it even within the world of "The Killer," which premiered in Venice on Sunday and stars Fassbender as a hired gun who has to improvise after a fatal assignment goes awry.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Based on a French graphic novel and adapted by Andrew Kevin Walker ("Seven"), the film at first feels like a high-end take on the usual genre tropes: There's the assassin with no name, the innocent woman in the way and the methodical list of revenge targets to be pursued. But then our protagonist's constant patter of narration starts to show cracks, as the Killer often thinks one thing and does another. By the end, you'll wonder if we know this guy at all, or whether he's ever really known himself.
And then there's what he's wearing. Though Hollywood would have us believe that assassins always look impossibly chic and well-tailored, Fincher puts his protagonist in Skechers, a zip-up fleece and a bucket hat.
"He's totally dorky!" the director said. "We were never intending for it to look glamorous."
Inspiration struck when Fincher flipped through reference photos and landed on a German tourist snapped wearing those nondescript items on the streets of Paris. "I was like, 'All of this stuff could be purchased in an airport,"' said Fincher, who sent the photo to his costume designer, Cate Adams. "I said, 'This is what he needs to be, a guy who can get off a plane and buy a whole wardrobe on his way from the gate to the rental car."'
Fincher found no complaints from his leading man, who wasn't in Venice because of the SAG-AFTRA strike: "Michael's cool. He was not freaked out about having to look a little dorky." And that aesthetic extends even to the Killer's escape from a botched job, which takes place not via high-speed car chase but with a zippy little motor scooter, though Fincher considered taking that sequence in an even dweebier direction. "At one point, we even debated the Razor scooter," he said, nixing that only because it wouldn't perform well during a stair stunt.
So though the Killer remains a mystery to himself, at least one thing can be said for sure of this indifferently dressed man: He ain't exactly John Wick.
"The $ 3,000 suit seems like it's played out," Fincher said. Still, he was surprised to find someone wearing his protagonist's silly headwear in another recent assassin movie: "It's funny because when Pitt told me he had selected a bucket hat for 'Bullet Train,' I was like, 'OK, dude, you're stepping into our sandbox."'
Though Fincher has a skill for image-making that extends back to the music videos he directed for the likes of Madonna, with "The Killer," he was more interested in dismantling that sort of cinematic iconography. Instead of a glamorous lair, Fassbender's character keeps his weapons in a mundane storage locker, and instead of using high-tech gadgets to break into targets' homes, he orders key-duplication tools off Amazon.
"I was like, 'I want James Bond by way of Home Depot,"' Fincher said. "By the end of this, you should be like, who's the guy in the rental car line with you, and why is he wearing that outdated hat? You ignore the German tourist at your peril."
And while the movies would have us believe that the world is full of clever, high-flying assassins, Fincher sought to ground his character's tunnel vision in a more mundane reality. "I love the idea of a Charles Bronson character who's maybe misdiagnosed adult autistic," he said. "And before 2023, I'm not sure anybody would have gone, 'Oh, that makes sense."'
So if the Killer's fashion choices or inner motivations sometimes stump you, just know that's by design.
"He seems to have a hard time reading the room," Fincher said. "And any room that he goes into, eventually, he's the only guy in it."

Nathan Louis Jackson, Incisive Writer for Theater and TV, Dies at 44: [Biography]

Full text: He wrote plays that tackled big issues like the death penalty and gun violence. He also wrote for series including the superhero saga "Luke Cage."
Nathan Louis Jackson, an acclaimed playwright who grappled with serious issues like the death penalty, homophobia and gun violence -- and who was also known for his work on television shows like "Luke Cage," a Netflix series about a Black superhero -- died on Aug. 22 at his home in Lenexa, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City. He was 44.
His wife, Megan Mascorro-Jackson, confirmed the death. She did not know the cause, she said, but added that Mr. Jackson had had cardiac problems in the past few years, including an aortic dissection and an aortic aneurysm.
Mr. Jackson was still attending the Juilliard School when his play "Broke-ology" premiered in 2008 at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts. The story of a Black family in a poor neighborhood of Kansas City, Kan., where Mr. Jackson grew up, it focuses on a confrontation between two brothers over the care of their father, William (played by Wendell Pierce), who has a debilitating case of multiple sclerosis -- a disease that Mr. Jackson's father, who died in 2001, also had.
Reviewing the play in The Boston Globe, Louise Kennedy wrote that "what makes Jackson's writing feel true and fresh -- aside from its great humor"-- was the way he portrayed the brothers. Malcolm, she noted, "isn't just a selfish striver," nor is Ennis "just a resigned martyr" -- and William "isn't just a passive victim."
A year later, after Mr. Jackson received his artist diploma in playwriting from Juilliard, "Broke-ology" opened Off Broadway at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center.
"'Broke-ology' is a decidedly imperfect work," Robert Feldberg wrote in The Record of Hackensack, N.J., "but it's a very promising debut in the big time for a playwright with a rare quality: heart."
Mr. Jackson's next play, "When I Come to Die," explored the emotional turmoil of a death row inmate whose execution goes awry -- the drug cocktail that was supposed to kill him managed only to stop his heart temporarily -- forcing him to wonder what to do with an unexpected extension of his life, and if he will face another execution.
"I started thinking about people in weird time positions, and these cats know exactly how much time they have left on this earth," Mr. Jackson said of death row inmates in an interview with The New York Times in 2011, when the play was running Off Broadway at the Duke Theater, a production of Lincoln Center Theater's program for emerging playwrights. "But what happens if you get more of it?"
Although Mr. Jackson established an early place for his work in New York City, he remained close to his Midwestern roots. In addition to living in Kansas, he was the playwright in residence at the Kansas City Repertory Theater, in Missouri, from 2013 to 2019.
That theater staged productions of "When I Come to Die" and "Broke-ology" as well as the world premieres of two more of his plays: "Sticky Traps," about a woman's response to protests by a homophobic preacher at the funeral of her gay son, who had killed himself; and "Brother Toad," about the reactions in the Kansas City community to the shooting of two Black teenagers.
"The beautiful thing about his writing is that he never told the audience what to think," Angela Gieras, the executive director of the Kansas City Rep, said in a phone interview. "He'd share a story that was compelling and truthful and let the people have their own conversations."
Nathan Louis Jackson was born on Dec. 4, 1978, in Lawrence, Kan. His father, Cary, was a heating and cooling service technician. His mother, Bessie (Brownlee) Jackson, was a preschool teacher.
Nathan Jackson said he had not been a good student in high school, studying as little as he could.
"Ironically, I failed English," he told Informed Decisions, a Kansas State University blog, in 2017. "I didn't want to read Shakespeare."
He graduated from Kansas City Kansas Community College with an associate degree in 1999. At Kansas State, where he majored in theater, he made his first attempt at playwriting by creating monologues for forensics competitions, staged to develop debating and advocacy skills in students.
"I'm there in the Midwest, and there ain't no other Black folks doing this, so I'd just end up doing August Wilson every time," he told The Times. "I wanted to do a piece that speaks for me, so I said, 'I'll just write my own stuff."'
Mr. Jackson wrote two plays in college that were recognized by the Kennedy Center after his graduation. He won the Lorraine Hansberry Playwriting Award twice, for "The Last Black Play" and for "The Mancherios," which he adapted into "Broke-ology," and the Mark Twain Comedy Playwriting Award, also for "The Last Black Play."
After graduating with a bachelor's degree in 2003, Mr. Jackson acted in a children's theater, took graduate courses in environmental science and writing, and worked as the manager of a barbecue restaurant.
He moved to New York City to attend Juilliard in 2007. He and his wife lived in a diverse neighborhood there, and he remembered seeing people from all over the world on the subway.
But at the theater, "I did not see that," he said in an interview with KCUR-FM, a public radio station in Kansas City, Mo., in 2016, "What I saw was predominantly white, older and with a little money in their pockets."
He strove to write plays featuring "people marginalized by poverty, incarceration or gun violence," Ms. Mascarro-Jackson said in an interview.
"Lots of times they were Black characters," she added, "because that's what he knew."
In addition to his wife, Mr. Jackson is survived by his mother; a daughter, Amaya; a son, Savion; a sister, Ebony Maddox; and a brother, Wardell.
Over the last decade, while continuing to work in the theater, Mr. Jackson also wrote episodes of several TV series, including "13 Reasons Why," "Resurrection," "S.W.A.T.," "Southland," "Shameless" and "Luke Cage," for which he was an executive story editor. He spent a lot of time in Los Angeles, where he underwent the aortic dissection in 2019.
"The series makes a bigger, grander statement about African American men and how we view them," he told The Kansas City Star in 2016, referring to "Luke Cage," a Marvel show whose title character is a former convict (played by Mike Colter) with superhuman strength and unbreakable skin who solves crimes in Harlem.
He added: "It is undoubtedly a Black show. But at the same time, it's just a superhero show. We deal with something all the other superheroes deal with. We just do it from a different standpoint."

Tiafoe Electrifies His Sport but Tries To Stay Grounded: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Returning to the U.S. Open after last year's electric run and crushing defeat, the boundary-busting American thinks he can win it all -- and make tennis cool.
One year ago, Frances Tiafoe headed to the U.S. Open, beloved within the tennis world but a relative unknown outside it. He emerged as the first American man to reach the U.S. Open semifinals since 2006, and the first Black American man since Arthur Ashe.
Tiafoe did it by upsetting the great Rafael Nadal in an emotional, magnetic match in, as a colleague put it at the time, "a stadium packed to the rafters with the sound bellowing off the roof after nearly every point." When he eventually lost in the semis to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set banger, Michelle Obama asked to see him afterward, to thank him and console him. And the national media rushed to tell his story -- an unusual one in a predominantly white, wealthy sport.
Heading into this year's Open, Tiafoe is the world No. 10. No longer the underdog, he is now contending with the burden and blessing of expectations and the distractions of sports celebrity. I sat down with him one week before the Open, at the Rock Creek Tennis Center in Washington, D.C., not far from where he grew up. We talked about whether his story really represents "the American dream," if he's looking forward to Novak Djokovic's retirement, and ... pickleball. This interview has been condensed and edited for length and clarity.
I am wondering what it's like at this moment in your career. You're being profiled in magazines. I just saw you in Vanity Fair . You've got N.B.A. stars in your box. It's got to be pretty wild.
Yeah, I talk about it all the time. That saying that your life can change overnight is 100 percent true. After I beat Rafa Nadal at last year's Open, I felt like I was looked at totally different. You don't realize what you're doing, how crazy it is, while you're doing it because you're doing it. I think afterward, going home and buying little things at CVS and ladies are like, "Oh my god, I can't believe this is you." It's been crazy. It's definitely not meant for everybody. It's definitely a life shift.
Can you tell me a little bit about that? I mean, very few people will have that experience.
You need to really have solid people around you. Everybody says that but don't really live by it. A lot of people are going to want to take your time. All of a sudden, everyone wants to be your best friend. The famous guy wants to hang out, and he can do it at that time, but you maybe need to not do that. And I think the biggest thing for me is learning to say no. I still need to do a much better job of that. I've seen it eat a lot of people up. It gets to people's heads.
What have you said no to that you wanted to do?
Even little things, like an appearance with one of my new brand partners that would have been a cool sit-down with Matt Damon, who I'm a big fan of. But I can't do it, can't go. I got to play a tournament. And it's like, ahhh.
You know, like, going on "The Shop" with LeBron -- stuff that I've wanted to do, but scheduling just hasn't quite worked out. And then obviously parties. You'll get invited, but you probably should play a tournament. The reason people know you? You should probably stay on that.
When you say you've seen other people get pulled off their path --
People who are so hot for a second and then you just don't hear about. And I think that's the difference between one-hit wonders and people with longevity. It's just that they're so obsessed with what they're doing and what got them to a certain place.
I want to talk a little about your back story. You're the son of immigrants from Sierra Leone. When you were little, your father literally helped build an elite tennis center in College Park, Md., as a construction worker. And then he got a job there as its custodian. And you actually lived there part time with your dad and your twin brother. And you started training there at the age of 5, which is incredible.
These details of your life are the headline of most articles about you. Does it feel like people get your story right? Are there things that you feel like people don't understand when they talk about the way you came up?
I feel like people do and don't. People hear it, they know about it, but I don't think they realize how crazy it actually is. I mean, I really was a big long shot, a huge long shot. And it just goes to show that being great at something is just having a level of obsession, and that's what I had. I just hope it inspires a lot of people, honestly.
You talked about how extraordinary your story is. And I guess there's a couple of ways that you can think about it. Version one is that this is the American dream, that a family can come to this country, and within a generation their son can be one of the top 10 tennis players in the whole world. But I think there's another version, which is that without an incredible amount of luck, you could have been just as talented, you could have been just as driven as you are, and yet never have become a professional tennis player.
How do you think about the balance between those two versions -- that your story shows both the incredible opportunities in America, but also that there are these inequalities that mean that it's much harder for someone like you to be able to get to where you are?
Ironically, I look at it more as the second version.
Really? So then what does your story say about why there aren't more Tiafoes?
Well, it's the lack of access, right? The biggest thing with the game of tennis is that it's so hard to just start to play. Like very, very tough for people in low-income areas to just play the game of tennis. Shoes, rackets, clothes, stringing, court time. If it's cold and you play inside, you pay for the court. You pay for coaching. I mean, if I'm a young kid, why wouldn't I just go and play basketball, where I need three other guys to play two-on-two and a hoop? It's a no-brainer.
I think that's the crazy thing. I imagine if I wasn't, as you said, wasn't in that situation --
That your dad got the job at this place that allowed you to have the opportunity to be seen and to play.
Think about how many people, if they were in my situation, could be doing what I'm doing. People that come from similar backgrounds as me, could do something special. That's what I think about. Why aren't more people lucky enough to be in that position?
There have barely been any elite Black American male tennis players. How do you diagnose that problem?
That's why I look at my story that way. I mean, 50 years until an African American male made a semifinal of the U.S. Open? Fifty years. You're telling me in 50 years a Black male can't be in the semifinal of the U.S. Open?
Granted, it was a great accomplishment for me! But I don't want to wait another 50.
I want to ask you about a separate issue, or maybe you think it's connected. But there's a real question about why American male players in general have struggled so much in the past two decades. An American man hasn't won a Grand Slam since 2003. And until your run last year, there really haven't been any U.S. stars on the men's side in the way there were before. Agassi and Sampras, McEnroe, Connors. Why do you think American men in general have had such a hard time?
That's always a funny question. I've been dealing with it for a long time.
I think it is a bit of a separate issue from what we were just speaking about. My rebuttal to it is always: It doesn't really matter where your flag is from. Essentially it was four guys winning Grand Slams for a decade. One of the guys is still going at it, however old he is. He doesn't seem like he's stopping.
He's 36. Djokovic.
Exactly. So I don't think that's really a flag issue. I think that's just an era issue. I mean, the best decade of tennis ever.
But we're at this changing-of-the-guard moment. Roger Federer retired last year. Nadal, who you beat last year at the U.S. Open, is having a tough season with injuries. He's also talked about retiring. Djokovic is still very much in the mix, but he is indeed 36 years old. Are you secretly glad these guys are winding down?
Yes and no. My goal when I was younger, I wanted to beat one of those guys in the highest-level event. You want to be the best, so you've got to beat the best. So I'm not like, Oh, man, I can't wait for these guys to stop. I think that's a bad mentality. I think it's I've got to get better. I've got to beat these guys.
I mean, I'm playing Rafa last year. I should have more legs than he has. Should! And it motivates me. Because even if Novak retires, you have new guys. Carlos Alcaraz is very good. There's always going to be someone who you're going to have to beat.
So, um, nah.
I was watching this conversation you had with Chris Eubanks and Ben Shelton, two other young Black American players. And you said, "We're going to be the reason why the game changes." What did you mean by that?
I just think diversity in sports, right? You bring a whole different demographic to the game. It's history, and you're watching it live. It's the reason why Chris Eubanks's run at Wimbledon was so big. It's iconic stuff in a predominantly white sport. So I think we have a bit of a different impact. You start seeing more people of color in the stadium, paying that hard-earned money to come watch because it's history, it's different.
How does that make you feel, that more people are using their hard-earned money to come to the stands? People of color that you're bringing into the sport?
It means everything to me. It means everything to me, but at the same time it's like, damn, you feel the responsibility to perform, to be your best self for them.
It's interesting. You've just discussed this tension, which is feeling really great to be able to inspire people, but also feeling like it's a burden. And I think most people of color who are successful would say that it's really difficult to be the first and the only. Because there is this tension. Do you feel like it pushes you farther, or do you feel like it sometimes can weigh you down?
It's a great question. First off, yeah, as you achieve it, you definitely think about that. I don't want to be the first and only, as I said earlier. But I think it inspires me, man. It really does. It makes me want to have longevity with this thing at a high level. Because you think about Serena and Venus. That's why you create a Sloane Stephens winning a Grand Slam. That's why you create a Coco Gauff, Naomi Osaka. And that's the position I want to be in, right?
But the job doesn't end until you do the ultimate goal, and that's to win a Grand Slam.
That's your goal right now? That's the thing?
That's the only thing that matters, to be fair. If I win a Grand Slam, there's nothing anyone could say or ask of me after that.
So you've been pretty vocal about how you think tennis should modernize and bring in new fans. You've said you'd like to see the sport borrow from basketball and be more relaxed when it comes to fan behavior. Why do you think that would be a good thing?
People are like, oh, that's not this game, that's not tennis. Well, the question was how do we bring in younger fans? If you go to a soccer game, you go to a football game, a baseball game, you're not quiet, are you?
No.
It's entertainment. Obviously with tennis you need a little bit more structure. But for example, in between games, when people are standing on top of the stadium and ask the usher, "Well, when can I come down? I'm paying for tickets and I can't even come and go as I please?"
I don't want to change the whole way of it, but within reason. I think a lot more young people would be like, OK, this is cool. You know, music playing more constantly, maybe in between points or in high-pressure moments.
You think about the U.S. Open atmosphere, and they're doing it anyway. Like, I'm playing in that stadium, it's rockin'. People are drunk out of their minds, they're just screaming whenever they want. You can't control the environment anyway, so you might as well let it rock.
But, hey, man, I don't make the rules.
OK, I have a question for you. What do you think of pickleball?
[Laughs] I think it's a sport I should invest in. I don't think it's a sport that I like. I don't think it's a great sport. But from the business side, I love it.
I don't think it takes very much skill. I go to Florida and I see a lot of older people playing and joking with the kids and having fun, but as far as creating all these leagues and tournaments and pro events, I just feel like tennis players who couldn't quite do it out here are trying to make something out there.
And they're closing down tennis courts in order to make pickleball courts.
For that sport to have an effect on the game of tennis, it's ridiculous to me.
Thank you for indulging me. To get back to your generation: There's a lot of buzz around Carlos Alcaraz. He's 20, he's won two Slams, and it looks like he's just getting started. Are you worried he's a player who's becoming the guy to beat?
No, it's good! It's good. He's good. He's good for the game. Hell of a player. He is going to be special. He's going to be a guy that's going to push me to always want more and be at my best, because if I want to achieve anything special, I got to go through him. Once Novak leaves, he's the guy to beat.
That brings me to where you are right now. You're world No. 10. You've won a couple of tournaments this year, but you've also been knocked out early in others, including a heartbreaker at Wimbledon . How do you evaluate your overall performance this year?
I think I've had a good year. I've won 30-something matches. I've won a couple titles. I'm probably the most consistent I've been this year as far as week to week. But I'd much rather take more L's, more losses, with a deeper run in a Slam. So we got one more shot. And obviously I want to go deep and put myself in title contention.
How are you preparing for that?
I know what I want to do. I know I want to win the event. It's a matter of beating the guys you're supposed to beat. But it is what it is. I'm 25. It doesn't have to be right now.
I want to ask you a little bit about the specifics of your game. You changed coaches. You reworked your technique, particularly your forehand. I watched the Netflix "Break Point" episode -- that's the documentary series about the tennis tour -- and there was a lot of talk about your focus, about trying to up your consistency. So when you think about how your game has changed, do you think the shift has been more mental or more physical?
The physical side has played a part. I've gotten much more fit, much more lean in the last couple years. But I think the mental side is the biggest thing. I've just made a choice. I made a choice that I'm committing to the game. I made a choice that I'm going to be more professional. I made a choice that I'm going to sacrifice a bit more of my outside tennis activities. Pick your moments of whatever pleasure -- trying to just put tennis as the No. 1 priority.
So saying no to LeBron.
[Laughs] Yes.
Was there a moment when you made that choice?
Yes. Going into the pandemic, I was not in a good place. Playing horribly. I was just enjoying life and got really complacent and it showed in my game a lot. It was the first time I really went through adversity as it pertains to the game of tennis. Losing a lot of matches and I didn't really know how to handle it. So that was very tough.
And then, just having a conversation with my boys, looking at the rankings, I'm like, dude, these guys ahead of me, they're not better than me. Like, this is not reality. This can't be my reality. And then from that point, I hired coaches. A lot of my team is new. My fitness coach travels with me much more. I started just slowly making choices. Being coachable. Stop trying to act like I know everything. Just slowly break old habits, which is very tough. It's been a long process, but it's been good. These last three years have been good. I've changed a lot.
I want to take you back to last year's U.S. Open. Because, you know, losing is terrible for everyone, but it feels like it hits you particularly hard. In your postmatch interview after you lost in the semifinals, even though it was this incredible moment, you said, and I'm quoting here, "I feel like I let you guys down." Who did you feel like you let down?
The country.
The country?
The country. I've never felt that much weight. Never felt that much energy. I checked into my hotel three weeks prior to that match. It was kind of like, whatever, nobody was really bothering me. Then at the end, I have security outside my door, people are going crazy, I'm all over New York, can't go anywhere, everyone's coming to the match.
And I really believed I could do it. After I beat Rafa, after I backed up that win and I gave everything I had. You know, it just wasn't good enough. And at that particular moment, I genuinely felt that way. I felt like I let those guys down. I wasn't feeling sorry for myself, but I was letting them know that I want to come back and finish the job. It was an emotional moment. It was very tough. No competitor wants to feel like they fell short.
And now on the cusp of this year's Open --
I feel like I'm in a pretty good place. Going in, momentum-wise, it hasn't been a great couple of weeks. But honestly, no matter how I've played going in, I always feel like I can do something special in New York. That crowd behind me. There's something about people getting behind you and wanting it more than you almost do. You feel like you don't have a choice but to give everything.

Disruptive Power of Weight Loss Drugs Is Rippling Through Other Industries: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Retailers, the makers of foods marketed for weight loss, and other types of companies could see knock-on effects from the rise of diabetes and weight loss drugs like Ozempic.
As they do every summer, publicly traded companies posted their second-quarter results while Americans were baring their bodies on the beach. But this year, the timing was apt. On several earnings calls in August, chief executives reassured investors that the Ozempic revolution had not left them in the dust, and that they could somehow share in the blazing success of new diabetes and weight loss drugs.
"It puts us in a good position to be a solution for those who are on the drugs," said Dan R. Chard, the chief executive of Medifast, which makes diet products like shakes and protein bars, adding: "They're looking for guidance." He told analysts this even while explaining that new-generation drugs had helped pummel earnings, down 34.7 percent year on year.
"We will continue to study this," Michael Johnson, the chief executive of the nutritional supplement maker Herbalife, told investors. "And when we see an opportunity to capitalize on it, we will."
In theory, that opportunity -- both for making profits and for losing fortunes -- could be vast not only for the companies behind these drugs but also for some in completely different industries.
Known as GLP-1 drugs, the medications are already driving big profits. Novo Nordisk makes both Ozempic, which has been approved only for Type 2 diabetes, and its close relative Wegovy, which has been approved for weight loss. They mimic a glucagon-like peptide that regulates appetite in the brain, leaving people feeling sated for hours. Together, they helped send Novo's earnings rocketing up 32 percent in the first half of this year, and Novo's market value is now larger than the entire Danish economy. Eli Lilly's sales surged 28 percent in the second quarter, thanks to another diabetes drug, Mounjaro, which the Food and Drug Administration may approve for weight loss this year.
And the full potential isn't even clear yet. The market for weight loss drugs is huge: There are roughly 750 million obese people worldwide, including about 42 percent of adults in the United States, where obesity-related illnesses incur billions of dollars in health care costs each year. But Novo says GLP-1 drugs could eventually have other uses, like helping prevent cardiovascular disease among obese adults. There are signs they could treat addiction and even Alzheimer's, too.
"The market potential is very, very significant," Novo's chief financial officer, Karsten Knudsen, told me when I visited the company in June. "We're operating in kind of unusual territory."
Diet companies are bracing for disruption. For decades, weight loss companies have relied on branded, prepackaged meals and lifestyle programs. Some, like WeightWatchers and Noom, have raced to sell GLP-1 drugs themselves, while others still hope their products can survive the Ozempic era. Jenny Craig shut its weight loss centers in May after 40 years. And Simply Good Foods, which distributes Atkins diet products like frozen meals and cookies, will market Atkins as "a perfect complement to people thinking about using the drugs," the company's chief executive at the time, Joe Scalzo, told analysts in June.
The ripple effects are widening. Retailers like Walmart, Kroger and Rite Aid say GLP-1 prescriptions are bringing more people into stores, where they make other purchases. Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, told analysts in August that its executives "expect consumables, and health and wellness, primarily due to the popularity of some GLP-1 drugs, to grow as a percent of total."
Medtronic's chief executive, Geoff Martha, said the company had seen a "modest" dip in bariatric surgery, presumably as people opted for weight loss drugs instead. And some analysts believe the drugs could disrupt the American diet.
"If you're eating fast food every day, you'll probably continue to eat fast food every day," James van Geelen of Citrinas Capital Management said on Bloomberg's "Odd Lots" podcast. "You will just eat a lot less of it."
Still, there is room for other approaches to fighting obesity. "These drugs are game changers, but with an asterisk," said David Ludwig, an obesity specialist and pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School. (The drugs come with a long list of side effects.) "Even if you can reduce weight across the population with drugs, it's not going to eliminate the risks of a poor diet."
Flush with cash, Novo agrees. "We need to be looking at what's the next thing," its executive vice president for commercial strategy Camilla Sylvest, told me. In June, the company launched an obesity prevention unit near Copenhagen, to research how to stop the disease before people need to take drugs to lose weight. -- Vivienne Walt
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
The U.S. labor market begins to look like its old self. Employers added 187,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department reported Friday, and unemployment rose to 3.8 percent as the economy continued to lose momentum built up after pandemic lockdowns.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo visits China. She had the tricky task of promoting trade between the two superpowers while holding firm on technology export limits imposed in the name of American national security. The two countries agreed to create new dialogues, including a working group for commercial issues.
The White House names the first drugs set for Medicare price negotiations. The long-awaited list of 10 medicines will be subject to a landmark new program meant to reduce costs for Medicare. Drugmakers have pushed back against the plan, including in court, and Republicans have criticized the initiative as government overreach.
UBS reports a $ 29 billion quarterly profit, with an asterisk. The huge gain -- the biggest in banking history -- stems from the bank's acquisition of its rival Credit Suisse this spring for about $ 3.2 billion, a steep discount that is skewing UBS's results. But it belies the challenges that UBS faces as it moves to complete the largest takeover of a bank since the 2008 financial crisis.
The last girl boss
When Emily Weiss stepped down last year as the chief executive of Glossier, the skin care and beauty brand she founded in 2014, some called it the end of the "girlboss." That archetype -- of media-savvy female founders with venture-darling, millennial-focused start-ups -- had been propelled by "#Girlboss," the Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso's 2014 memoir.
Glossier, with its direct-to-consumer model and voice-y website, changed the way women buy makeup, eventually passing a $ 1 billion valuation. But the brand stumbled as it struggled to move into brick-and-mortar retail; faced criticism from retail employees who alleged a toxic, racist working environment; and shelved projects like a makeup line that departed from its dewy, barely-there look.
DealBook spoke to Marisa Meltzer, author of the upcoming book "Glossy: Ambition, Beauty, and the Inside Story of Emily Weiss's Glossier," about what lessons we might glean from Weiss and the #Girlboss movement.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Can you contextualize the #Girlboss movement?
It was pretty offensive and diminutive. No one except for Sophia was calling themselves out as a girlboss. But it was also something that benefited them because it attracted interest. It was a way for them to get press about their businesses that wasn't the typical things that female founders and C.E.O.s sometimes had to do, like a fashion spread.
There was a big debate at the time over whether the press would have covered the scandals at companies like Outdoor Voices, Man Repeller and Glossier differently if they had men at the helm. What do you think?
I think there was a bit of a thirst for blood. These women had been propped up in a way that was kind of annoying -- I'm sure it was annoying to them, too.
Some of those companies had real problems, like being sued over firing pregnant employees. And other companies had, like Glossier, an accusation of having a workplace, largely for their retail employees, that wasn't ideal. That's different than criminal behavior.
The reality is these companies weren't the same. The women at their helms were not all the same. And they weren't making the same mistakes. And they also didn't have the same level of success.
What happens to Glossier now?
Glossier seems to have taken the time since Emily stepped down to re-evaluate. They decided to really belatedly go into retail. They launched in Sephora last February. The larger task that they're trying to do is make the company in better shape for an exit.
Who might buy them?
A company like Estée Lauder that owns a lot of boutique brands would make sense. There's also Kering, the fashion house that owns Gucci, which has been making some visible plays to get more into the beauty market.
On our radar: The story of Carlos Ghosn
In 2019, while facing criminal charges of financial wrongdoing, the former Nissan executive Carlos Ghosn skipped bail and fled Japan in an elaborate plot that involved a private jet and a trunk with breathing holes drilled into it. At the time, DealBook called it "a movie-level caper," and two projects -- one by the BBC and another by Netflix -- were quick to portray it on video. But neither did so as well as a four-part Apple TV+ documentary series that was released last week.
"Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn" is produced by The Wall Street Journal and is based on a book by two of its reporters. With Ghosn's participation, it tells the thriller-like drama of one of the most memorable business stories this decade while exploring its nuances.
"The series explicitly poses the question of Carlos Ghosn: victim or villain?" The Guardian's Adrian Horton writes. "With blurred lines, overlapping narratives and convoluted paper trails, it doesn't land on a simple answer."

Full text: As Netflix pours more of its resources into original content, Amazon Prime Video is picking up the slack, adding new movies for its subscribers each month. Its catalog has grown so impressive, in fact, that it's a bit overwhelming. Here are some of our favorites you can stream right now.
'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' (2003) / 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' (2004)
Paying loving tribute to the exploitation movies of multiple eras and cultures, this double-feature dabbles in kung fu, anime, spaghetti western and Blaxploitation, its writer and director, Quentin Tarantino, deliriously hopping styles like a movie-crazy kid swapping out VHS tapes. But in all the pyrotechnics, Tarantino maintains his gift for quotable dialogue and charismatic characters, ending his blood-soaked saga on a surprisingly warm note. Our critics praised the "odd, feverish integrity" of "Vol. 1," and called "Vol. 2" "the most voluptuous comic-book movie ever made."
'Sorry to Bother You' (2018)
The musician and activist Boots Riley makes his feature directing debut with this wildly funny, frequently bizarre mixture of Marxist dogma and Marx Brothers-style silliness. LaKeith Stanfield (later an Oscar nominee for "Judas and the Black Messiah") stars as Cassius Green, a telemarketer who discovers the secret to success and must determine how nakedly to exploit it. That sounds like a fairly straightforward setup, but Riley approaches the material with the surrealistic eye of an experimental filmmaker, and ends up taking Cassius on a journey into the dark heart of extreme wealth and depravity. You may love it or you may hate it, but you've certainly never seen anything quite like it.
'When Harry Met Sally' (1989)
The director Rob Reiner and the screenwriter Nora Ephron all but defined the contemporary romantic comedy with this sparkling, charming and uproariously funny story of Sally (Meg Ryan) and Harry (Billy Crystal), who test their theories about if men and women can be friends. Stretching from their post-grad years to their early 30s, Harry and Sally's story is filled with quotable dialogue, colorful characters and one of the great punchlines in modern comedy ("I'll have what she's having"). But it's also a thoughtful exploration of gender roles and romantic expectations, and by the time Reiner and Ephron arrive at their lush Year's Eve wrap-up, they've earned the extravagance. (Crystal also shines in "City Slickers.")
'The Girl With All the Gifts' (2017)
This adaptation of the 2014 sci-fi novel by M.R. Carey dwells in the realm of British postapocalyptic zombie horror familiar to fans of "28 Days Later" and "28 Weeks Later," but uses its genre trappings as a vehicle for a thoughtful character study and knotty morality play. At its center is the remarkable Sennia Nanua in the title role, a young student who has learned how to stifle her hunger for human flesh but finds her self-discipline challenged amid a zombie uprising. Gemma Arterton, Paddy Considine and Glenn Close provide ample support as the teachers who may be her key to survival (and vice versa). Creepy and efficient, it's a slick thriller with a classy pedigree that nonetheless raises plenty of goose flesh.
'Tár' (2022)
Cate Blanchett is Lydia Tár, an acclaimed orchestral conductor, composer and instructor whose precariously balanced life and career begin to collapse around her in this "cruelly elegant, elegantly cruel" character study from the writer and director Todd Field ("In the Bedroom"). Blanchett was nominated for best actress at last year's Oscars for her electrifying turn as a woman whose genius has long excused her considerable flaws; Nina Hoss is terrific as the longtime partner who can no longer look the other way. Field directs the story of Lydia's fall from grace with chilly, riveting precision and welcome psychological nuance. (Hoss is also excellent in "A Most Wanted Man.")
'Top Gun: Maverick' (2022)
Tom Cruise's long-awaited sequel to his 1986 smash was a shockingly successful attempt to have it both ways. The filmmakers updated its events and characters for contemporary audiences, but it's not an outright subversion, either. "Maverick" checks the boxes of the original -- there's thrilling action, sunglasses and leather jackets aplenty, and Cruise at his coolest -- and its audience-pleasing conclusion feels like an honest-to-God throwback. (For more '80s-style adventure, check out "The Lost City" on Prime.)
'99 Homes' (2015)
The acclaimed writer and director Ramin Bahrani's early independent films ("Man Push Cart," "Chop Shop") examined life at the margins of the American dream. He continues this inquisition with a thoughtful and compelling examination of the desperation and exploitation that ensued after the subprime mortgage crisis. An affecting Andrew Garfield stars as Dennis, a suddenly unemployed construction hand who loses his home and is determined to get it back. Michael Shannon is blisteringly good as the broker who puts him to much-needed work by preying on other overextended middle-class victims. The question at the heart of this pointed morality play is ultimately not whether you'll sell your soul, but how much it's really worth.

On 1,000 Planets, High Expectations: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Starfield almost immediately nudges its players to the edges of the cosmos. In the opening hours of the role-playing video game, it's possible to land your spaceship on Earth's moon or zip 16 light-years from a remote outpost to Alpha Centauri. When you open your map and zoom out from a planet, you can behold its surrounding solar system; zoom out again, and you're scrolling past luminous stars and the mysterious worlds that orbit them.
That sprawling celestial journey within Starfield, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, reveals both the tremendous potential and the monumental challenge of an open-world space adventure. Bethesda has hyped an expansive single-player campaign with 1,000 explorable planets. And expectations around the game, officially releasing on Sept. 6 after a 10-month delay, are nearly as vast.
It's the first new universe in 25 years for Bethesda, known for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series. It's also a high-stakes moment for Microsoft, which makes the Xbox and has long faced criticism that it produces fewer hit games than its console rivals, Sony and Nintendo. To compete, Microsoft went on a spending spree, acquiring Bethesda's parent company in 2020 and agreeing to purchase Activision Blizzard in 2022, a $ 69 billion bet that is being challenged by regulators.
Now Bethesda must deliver. Known for letting players navigate competing factions and undertake eccentric quests, the studio hopes Starfield will dazzle those clamoring for engaging encounters with alien life-forms or space mercenaries as well as a sense of boundless exploration.
But creating a game the size of a galaxy is extraordinarily time-consuming and expensive, and several past attempts that shot for the stars failed to stick the landing.
"The biggest challenge you face when building any sci-fi game is the almost limitless imagination as players we have about space and about the universe," said Aaryn Flynn, the chief executive of Inflexion Games and a former general manager of BioWare, which makes the sci-fi Mass Effect series. "Players want that captured in the experience."
Todd Howard, the executive producer of Bethesda, was well aware that Starfield, which is being released for Windows computers and the Xbox Series X and S, would have to be expansive to reflect the allure of space travel.
"All of us, I think, at some point look to the sky and say, 'Man, I wonder what it would be like to blast off and land on the moon?' or 'I wonder what would be beyond that?' or 'What's in that star?' or 'Is there life out there?"' Howard said in an interview, adding: "We needed the scale to have that feeling. We could have made a game where there are four cities and four planets. But that would not have the same feeling of being this explorer."
So Starfield has promised 1,000 searchable planets, about 10 percent of which contain life in addition to quests and valuable raw materials. That scale has caused some concern that the studio responsible for glitchy releases like Skyrim and Fallout 76 is in over its head -- and that some aspects of space will be a black hole of fun.
The game's developers say they are confident they have struck the right balance by using a mix of scientific data and artificial intelligence to generate realistic planets, and then fine-tuning those worlds with human programmers who also craft the quests and the enemies that players will encounter.
"We have artists who hand-built the rocks, partly from scanning real rocks in our world and changing them," Howard said. "And then we have algorithms that create the landscape of a planet and put the rocks and the trees in all the right places."
When players land on a new planet in Starfield, they may encounter a tangle of atlas weed or discover that giant crabs can viciously attack. Those who enjoy hoarding can pick up items as innocuous as a jar of sealant in an abandoned laboratory.
But exactly how the game unfolds will differ for each player. Howard acknowledged that Starfield posed "an incredibly difficult design challenge" -- one his team tried to solve by building a planet content manager that allows certain quests to be placed as players reach the surface. One player might run into a derelict outpost; someone else might hear another spaceship's engine as she wanders. Developers have also tried to ensure that very little will happen in some cases, so that players "get some periods of loneliness," Howard said.
Despite the technological advancements that have made it possible to generate countless planets with ease, more than a dozen gaming executives, analysts and developers said in interviews that studios must be wary of overpromising what they can deliver.
No Man's Sky drew incredible hype when its developers at Hello Games spoke of a procedurally generated universe of no fewer than 18 quintillion planets. But when the game made its debut in 2016, players found its worlds uninteresting and its alien dinosaurs crude. The criticism was so harsh that one of the company's founders said he received death threats; the independent studio was investigated for false advertising and eventually cleared.
"Procedural generation can generate new maps but not compelling gameplay," said Elena Bertozzi, a professor of game design and development at Quinnipiac University. "No Man's Sky had a lot of planets with nothing interesting going on."
A spokesman for Hello Games declined to comment, referring to public remarks that one of its founders, Sean Murray, made in 2019. By then, the game had improved and was being praised for its successful postrelease updates.
"Innovation is in such short supply in the industry, and we need it so badly," Murray said at the time. "We need to encourage it, we need to foster it. We need to ask people to shoot for the moon. And if they fail on their first attempt, we need to be there to support them."
The team behind Mass Effect: Andromeda, the fourth installment in the role-playing series, also planned to leverage procedural generation, said Mac Walters, who worked for BioWare for almost two decades as a writer, producer and director and joined the Andromeda project partway through.
"There was this vision that we were going to have a thousand planets," Walters said, confirming some details of an investigation into what the gaming news site Kotaku called a "turbulent and troubled" development. When Andromeda was released in 2017, there were about a half-dozen planets to explore.
BioWare did not respond to a request for comment. Flynn, the studio's former general manager, said the team was hamstrung by decisions such as the choice to use the Frostbite game engine, which was not intended for content-heavy role-playing games. He said the team had hoped to have enough sophistication in its algorithms to make the procedurally generated worlds "indistinguishable" from what developers were making, so that they could focus on building a transporting narrative.
"We didn't get there," he said. "And so our developers still had to come over and work on the procedural content a fair bit."
When players finally got their hands on the game, many were shocked by its lack of polish. The characters' facial animations were so clumsy, they became fodder for internet memes. Critics assailed what they described as cheesy dialogue, subpar voice acting and major plot problems.
Avoiding similar pitfalls with Starfield is paramount for Microsoft, which desperately needs a new blockbuster game as its flagship franchise, Halo, fades in relevance. Some time after Bethesda announced an open-world space game in 2018, Microsoft executives learned that Sony was considering a deal to make it available exclusively on PlayStation consoles.
"When we heard that Starfield was going to potentially end up skipping Xbox -- we can't be in a position as a third-place console where we fall further behind on console ownership," Phil Spencer, the chief executive of Microsoft Gaming, testified during a court hearing in June that focused on the Activision acquisition. "We had to secure content to remain viable."
Microsoft shelled out $ 7.5 billion for ZeniMax Media, the parent company of a swath of game studios that included Bethesda, but is still looking for a return on investment. Redfall, the most prominent Xbox game resulting from the deal so far, flopped when it was released in May.
Xbox owners have also been denied a seat at this year's feast of role-playing games, including Final Fantasy XVI, which is currently available only on the PlayStation 5, and Tears of the Kingdom, a Zelda game for the Switch. Baldur's Gate 3, which has been rapturously received by computer gamers, hits the PlayStation 5 on Wednesday; an Xbox version is due later this year.
Microsoft has pioneered a shift in gaming away from $ 60 or $ 70 retail purchases and toward a Netflix-style subscription service that offers hundreds of games for between $ 10 and $ 17 per month. That service, Game Pass, had more than 25 million subscribers last year but needs a steady supply of marquee games to make it a can't-miss subscription.
If Starfield wins over players, "it becomes a crowning jewel in that portfolio," said Yung Kim, the head of partnerships at the gaming data firm Aldora and a former analyst for Piper Sandler.
Spencer said he would measure Starfield's success simply by how many people play it, regardless of how they do so. "Everything comes from that. How many people are playing across devices?" he wrote in an email. "I want Starfield to be Bethesda Game Studios' most played game ever."
Starfield draws inspiration from movies and television shows like "Interstellar," "Battlestar Galactica" and "The Martian," Howard said, but also from real organizations like NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX. The game's main story focuses on collecting mysterious alien artifacts and can be completed in about 30 hours. But players can spend hundreds more customizing spaceships, harvesting resources, exploring planets and fighting bloodthirsty pirates.
Focusing on realism helped ground the project, Bethesda executives said. Engineers toured NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which Ashley Cheng, Bethesda's managing director, said helped inspire Starfield's realistic simulation of the galaxy -- down to how quickly a planet rotates around its axis. The trip also helped set parameters on Starfield's procedural generation of planets to ensure that their geography was realistic.
All of the names, locations and characteristics of Starfield planets are the same for every player. Some are temperate, made of rock and filled with fauna and flora. Others are gas giants in a deep freeze that cannot be landed on. Still others have chemical water, low gravity or a surface so hot it emits scalding vapor fog. (Earth, in 2330, is essentially a desert filled with corrosive gas.)
"They all have different biomes," Angela Browder, Bethesda's studio director, said. "We all have this idea of what space is supposed to be like. Whatever you thought it was going to look like, we probably have a planet that matches up."
Browder said developers also had to weigh realism against enjoyment. Survival in space needed to be challenging, but not too burdensome. The team ditched the idea of making players refuel their spaceships, and tried to make the controls for piloting them accessible.
Their desire for accuracy also kept expectations in check. Cheng said part of the balance was making sure there was enough to do without jam-packing all 1,000 planets with content. Not every location, he said, "is supposed to be Disney World."
"The point of the vastness of space is you should feel small. It should feel overwhelming," Cheng said. "Everyone's concerned that empty planets are going to be boring. But when the astronauts went to the moon, there was nothing there. They certainly weren't bored."

Yiddish Is Having a Moment: [Op-Ed]

Author: Stavans, Ilan

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For a language without a physical address that has come frighteningly close to extinction, Yiddish's will to live seems inexhaustible. The lesson is simple and straightforward: Survival is an act of stubbornness.
Yiddish has been experiencing something of a revival. Online courses mean that anyone from Buenos Aires to Melbourne might learn to speak it. There are new translations of long-forgotten works and literary classics. A Broadway staging of "Fiddler on the Roof" was performed in Yiddish. And streaming platforms like Netflix have released series, including "Shtisel," "Unorthodox" and "Rough Diamonds," fully or partially in Yiddish.
Before World War II, approximately 13 million Jews, both secular and religious, spoke Yiddish. Today it is estimated that there are about a quarter of a million speakers in the United States, about the same number in Israel and roughly another 100,000 in the rest of the world. Nowadays the vast majority of those who speak the language are ultra-Orthodox. They aren't multilingual, as secular Yiddish speakers always were.
I was born and raised in Mexico City, speaking Yiddish and Spanish. Whereas the part of my extended family who fled to New York and Chicago lost Yiddish along the way, Mexican Jews remained more in the community, continuing to use the language even as they remained secular.
It's worth noting that Yiddish has been maligned by gentiles and Jews alike. Antisemites considered it the parlance of vermin, while the rabbinical elite deemed it unworthy of serious Talmudic discussion. As the saying goes, better an honest slap in the face than an insincere kiss. I like to think that animosity has helped the language to be nimble, clearheaded and improvisational.
Yiddish came to life at least a millennium ago. The earliest historical documents we have date back to the 12th century in the Rhineland in western Germany as a code-switching form of communication -- called loshn ashkenaz, the language of Ashkenaz -- juxtaposing High German and Hebrew. There is a scholarly theory that posits that the combination was actually High German and Aramaic, which was used by Middle Eastern Jews. At any rate, Yiddish was the tongue of women, children and the illiterate.
By the time the Italian poet Dante Alighieri composed "The Divine Comedy," the "jargon," as it was derided, had attained political, economic and cultural power, giving Eastern European Jews a sense of interconnectedness. While it is true that Shakespeare didn't imagine Shylock to be a Yiddish speaker, it's likely that Jewish merchants like him would at least have heard about di mame loshn, the mother tongue.
During the Enlightenment, secularists, called Maskilim, depicted Yiddish as a contorted language, incapable of "civilized" thought. In their view, to be a full-fledged European citizen one needed to speak the languages of Goethe, Locke and Voltaire. On the other hand, Hasidism, a religious movement that at the beginning was against the rabbinical establishment, thrived in Yiddish.
The superb stories of its founder, the Baal Shem Tov, and his descendants, including Rabbi Nakhman of Bratslev, his great-grandson, were, for the most part, disseminated in Yiddish. Rabbi Nakhman is considered a forerunner of Franz Kafka's worldview on fate as being shaped by obscure, mysterious, perhaps divine drive. Fittingly, Kafka studied the language and in 1912 even delivered a speech in Yiddish.
The embrace of secularism is best represented by the Yiddish literary output of the 19th century, including the most beloved of Yiddish writers, Sholom Aleichem, the author of "Tevye the Dairyman," a story about a shtetl dweller whose life is redefined by secularization, politics, antisemitism and immigration. As in the case of Tevye, Yiddish was the lingua franca of Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian and other Jews, allowing them to have a neutral meeting ground while inhabiting the same stateless culture.
My paternal grandmother, originally from Brodno, a neighborhood in Warsaw, spoke Yiddish with her family and Polish and Russian with the gentiles. That universality has served Yiddish. Eliezer Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto and a native Yiddish speaker, modeled his constructed language as an "auxiliary," or a second language, an approach that would allow people to put away their differences without losing their individuality. Yiddish was already doing that for Ashkenazi Jews.
Another enemy of Yiddish was Zionism. In the late 19th century, as the hope for a Jewish state found its ground, it was portrayed as jargon spoken by the diaspora -- the language of homelessness, without a true national voice. To combat this deficit, Hebrew needed to be revived. Soon the myth sprung of the Hebrew pioneer, in sharp contrast with the large-nosed, hunchbacked Jew that Zionists themselves vilified.
Hebrew, which officially became the national language of the state of Israel in 1948, is spoken by about nine million people around the world. For some, the language symbolizes far-right Israeli militarism.
In contrast, Yiddish represents exile -- a longing for home. It was the backbone of the Jewish labor movement in the United States, and the feminist Emma Goldman championed women's equality and free love in Yiddish. Abraham Cahan, the feisty, commanding editor in chief of Forverts -- The Forward, the left-leaning Yiddish daily in New York at the turn of the century -- saw the language as a tool for educating Jewish immigrants about their rights.
Given everything Yiddish has gone through -- how it was a tool of cross-border continuity, how it was pushed to the crematories by the Nazis, how after the Shoah it thrived in some diasporas but was pushed aside in others -- its sheer endurance is nothing short of miraculous.
Yet nostalgia alone cannot push a revival beyond its narrow means. It continues to be a language without a homeland, without an army, a flag, a post office or a central bank, the language of a small, dispersed people. Its speakers may be few, but as my maternal grandmother used to say, words should be weighted, not counted.

Cable TV Model Broken, A Giant of Cable TV Says: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Charter Communications told investors Friday that its fraught negotiation with Disney was a sign of a larger problem with the traditional cable-TV business model.
One of the biggest cable companies in the United States has a message for media companies, its major partners in a decades-old business: The traditional cable-TV model is broken, and it needs to be fixed or abandoned.
Cable TV has become too expensive for consumers and providers, Charter Communications said in an 11-page presentation to investors on Friday, adding that cord-cutters and rising fees are contributing to a "vicious video cycle."
The presentation comes amid negotiations between Charter and the Walt Disney Company, owner of popular cable channels including ESPN and FX, which will not be available to Charter's nearly 15 million pay-TV subscribers until both sides agree on how much Charter will pay Disney to carry its channels. Subscribers to Charter's Spectrum TV service will be without access to the U.S. Open tennis tournament and college football games during a holiday weekend.
These so-called carriage fights are commonplace in the media industry, with channels going dark for days or weeks on cable systems while the two sides -- cable providers and content creators -- haggle over how much the channels are worth and how to bundle them. But Charter's suggestion that parts of its own business model are in disrepair adds a new wrinkle to the crisis facing the cable-TV business.
The fight comes at a time of declining subscriptions: More than five million Americans end their cable-TV subscriptions annually, according to research from SVB MoffettNathanson.
Almost every traditional media company is trying to hold on to its cash-rich cable partnerships while building streaming businesses that will eventually replace those alliances. But investors in traditional media companies have also grown impatient with attempts to build new streaming businesses, saying they are not as profitable as cable TV used to be.
The pressure is forcing traditional media companies to wring cash from their businesses in other ways, including teaming up with competitors to bundle their streaming services.
Adding to the challenges, tech companies like Apple and Amazon are willing to pay top dollar to acquire live sports rights, further driving up programming costs. Cable companies, for their part, have weaned themselves off depending wholly on traditional TV revenue, by offering services like wireless internet.
But in trying to negotiate with Disney for a better deal, Charter's presentation goes a step further, delivering a scathing indictment of the cable television industry, which has generated billions of dollars for companies like itself and Disney for decades. It's a notable acknowledgment from Charter, one of the companies that propelled much of that growth.
"Customers are leaving the traditional video ecosystem, and losses have accelerated," according to Charter's presentation.
"Has the traditional TV ecosystem reached its proverbial tipping point?" said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst for LightShed Partners. "If ESPN is permanently gone from Charter, there will be a massive snowball effect that is catastrophic for traditional TV companies."
Disney fired back at Charter on Friday, saying that the cable giant had rejected a deal that reflected "market-based terms" and that Disney had proposed creative ways to make its streaming apps available to Charter's cable subscribers. Disney said its offer to Charter had included its "most favorable terms" on rates, distribution, packaging and advertising.
"Charter's actions are a disservice to consumers ahead of the kickoff for the college football season on ABC and ESPN's networks," Disney said in its statement.
At issue are the rates Charter will pay for Disney's programming and how those movies and shows will be distributed to Charter's customers in bundles. Charter has said it does not want to pay a premium for channels its customers do not watch, adding that rate increases are pushing customers to cut the cable cord.
Christopher Winfrey, the chief executive of Charter, said on an investor call Friday that he was "disappointed" with the stalemate with Disney. He said the company had proposed an alternative model that Disney would not accept.
"We're either moving forward with a new collaborative video model, or we're moving on," Mr. Winfrey said.
Charter's news conference prompted a sell-off of traditional media stocks, affecting the broader entertainment industry. Shares of Disney were down nearly 3 percent on Friday, Paramount declined more than 9 percent, and Warner Bros. Discovery fell 12 percent. Charter shares were down more than 3 percent.
As viewers abandon cable television for streaming services like Netflix, cable providers like Charter and Comcast have grown frustrated with paying a premium for content that fewer people are watching through traditional means.
Content providers like Disney are making adjustments of their own. The media giant has said it plans to offer a streaming version of ESPN, one of its most valuable TV channels, which has long been a linchpin of the traditional cable bundle. Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive, has said he is exploring options for ESPN, including finding a new partner for distribution or content.
On Friday, Charter said it had proposed a subscription package that included both traditional television and streaming apps, but Disney rejected its terms, said Rich DiGeronimo, president of product and technology. Charter said it was prepared to walk away from Disney's channels, instead adopting "alternate video solutions" that included services offered by Apple and Roku.
Charter has explored splitting off some sports programming, including regional sports networks, into a higher-cost package called Spectrum Select Plus. Mr. Winfrey said Friday that it had not pushed Disney to agree to put ESPN into that package.

Full text: Todd Barry, Tracy Morgan, Sasheer Zamata, Chris Fleming and Jared Freid riff on weird characters, middle age, lost histories and more.
Todd Barry, 'Domestic Shorthair'
Stream it on YouTube
Todd Barry speaks fluent sarcasm. After decades of refinement, honing his low-key deadpan into something flexible and distinctive, he can turn a sentence inside-out with the mildest shift in intonation, instantly divorcing what he says from what he means. The pivots in his jokes are subtle but crisp. Ever since David Letterman retired from late night, sarcasm has no better champion. Barry starts waving its flag as soon as the applause settles down on his very funny new special. "That is the type of forced fraudulent crowd response that will propel this whole show," he says, enough of a hint of a smile to soften the blow.
Barry is a taut joke teller more than a yarn-spinner. But his punchlines emerge from anecdotes filled with details about curious characters he's met, tales that have the quirkiness and surprise of what you find in a sensitively observed short story. There's the Uber drive who apologizes for not talking during the ride, the waiter who warns against the Italian dressing in a whisper and the cabinet salesman who says he loves his job because it allows him to eat with his customers. He filters the slightest interactions with them through his arch responses, mocking but not mean. His real adversaries are not people but hyperbole, nonsense or any pointless excess of emotion. And some of his most unexpected laughs are in his own mixing up of mountains and molehills. "My printer broke recently," he said, gently shifting gears to a parody of concern. "Sorry to bum you out."
Tracy Morgan, 'Takin' It Too Far'
Stream it on Max
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It's been a rough couple of years for Tracy Morgan, the veteran comic, "30 Rock" scene stealer and all-time great talk-show guest. He almost died after being hit by a Walmart truck, then during the pandemic, his marriage fell apart. In his baggy new special, he says his wife "took that social distancing too far."
If you were looking for a bracing and introspective hour on his troubles, you came to the wrong place. Morgan just brings up his problems to crack wise about them. There is little attempt at timeliness (the expiration date on jokes about the slap at the Oscars has passed) or ambitious set pieces with tight jokes snapping into place. This is a comic coasting on charisma, which he can do as well as anyone. His main subject is middle age. He's out to prove you don't need to be mature in your 50s. Instead, he doubles down on sex and fart jokes, yanking his shirt up, rubbing his belly, finishing with a dozen or so minutes on what it's like to sleep with older women. Ultimately, there's no escaping the fact that aging changes you. Morgan confesses he pushed a lap dance away at a strip club, shouting: 'You know my sciatica flared up!"
Sasheer Zamata, 'The First Woman'
Stream it on YouTube
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Why does everyone know Amelia Earhart but not Jerrie Mock, the first woman to fly solo around the world? According to the comic Sasheer Zamata, whose second stand-up special is full of hidden histories, it boils down to marketing. Mock kept to herself, saying, "The kind of person who enjoys being alone in a plane is not the kind who enjoys being continuously around other people." Zamata says she doesn't "like going places or doing things," so perhaps she can relate. Earhart married her publicist, and Zamata calls her the "original Kim Kardashian."
Her digression, filled with punchlines, is just one example of how this special unpacks lost or taboo stories. The political centerpiece of the set is about how we should talk more about female sexuality, especially for girls. She relates a story about masturbating for the first time with a lint roller, then opens the topic to the audience, resulting in some colorful crowd work. Zamata, a former "Saturday Night Live" cast member, turns jokes into carefully crafted vignettes, often hinging on a twist that leads her to widen her eyes for a long pause. She's a poised performer, effortlessly moving from crowd work to dating tales to political gibes. Her description of being hit by a car becomes a peg for how people (including doctors) ignore Black women when describing pain but pay attention to them on the question of what is cool. Her solution? Black women should champion illness ("Sickle cell is sick as hell!"), and disease will be "gentrified out of our bodies."
Chris Fleming, 'Hell'
Stream it on Peacock
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Whenever a new Chris Fleming video appears on my feed, I stop and pay attention. In a scroll of sameness, he's thrillingly unexpected, a shaggy-haired Los Angeles absurdist who often begins with an offhand and narrow idea (sitting in his car, considering the appeal of Adam Driver, say), then riffs on it with a gusto and flamboyance that accumulates its own comic momentum. His is a pointedly niche sensibility but responsible for some of the biggest laughs I have had on social media. His debut, a scattershot affair that mixes a performance at a theater with sketches, has some very funny oddball ideas, like his celebration of the Nissan Cube as the "one true asexual icon in American culture."
His precise dissection of basic families who think they're really eccentric is a characteristic hobby horse. But these bursts of lunacy don't build on one another. In the translation to long form, the pacing gets a little slack. Part of the problem might be editing (you must kill your darlings, especially when they involve sketches that go on too long) and an undercooked overall conceit. Fleming can't seem to entirely decide if his aesthetic is going to be polished or ragged, his material revealing or purely absurd. He's smart enough to commit to the personal and the weird, but absurdity requires its own rigor.
Jared Freid, '37 & Single'
Stream it on Netflix
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the crowded field of dating jokes, Jared Freid, an amusingly hyperventilating self-deprecator exploring red flags, online profiles and tensions between millennials and Generation Z, distinguishes himself in a couple of ways. In his very strong act-outs, he does an inspired impression of fake laughing that projects real discomfort. It gooses a familiar bit about married people talking to singles about the perils of matrimony into something spiky and layered. Secondarily, not since Leslie Jones has a comic done more with bulging eyes. While dead eyes can kill an act, expressive ones can illuminate it.

Struggling to Understand TV Dialogue: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Huh? What? There Are Ways to Improve the Sound on Your TV?" (Business, Aug. 18):
As an American expat, I got a good chuckle out of Brian X. Chen's article about poor dialogue sound quality in streaming. The premise, that using subtitles is a terrible inconvenience that diminishes one's enjoyment of video entertainment, is one of those peculiarly American complaints that seem bizarre to many people overseas.
In Chinese-speaking areas and other parts of East Asia, the wide variety of languages, accents and usages can make it tough to comprehend dialogue regardless of sound quality, so video nearly always comes with subtitles, whether it's on TV, in a movie theater or online. Nobody here seems to mind.
Indeed, the people in Malaysia who build the Sonos equipment that Mr. Chen praised must be thrilled that Americans will spend $ 900 on soundbars to avoid those irritating subtitles.
Michael P. Clarke
Taoyuan City, Taiwan
To the Editor:
We do not have to bring speakers to a movie theater to watch a movie and we should not have to put speakers on our TV sets to enjoy a television show. Modern television sets should come with high-resolution pictures and high-quality, audible sound. The quality of the sound is as important as the quality of the picture. We should not have to buy soundbars.
Bill Chastain
New York
To the Editor:
I've used closed captioning for a while now, not only because the sound quality on streaming services is far from as good as it should be but also because programs produced in England -- many of the shows on PBS, which I like -- use a lot of slang and hard-to-understand dialects.
But a major problem is that some of the streaming services, like Netflix, have closed captions that are far from helpful. They come on well before or well after the spoken words, and too often they flash on so fast that it is impossible to read the entire line of dialogue.
Michael Spielman
Wellfleet, Mass.
To the Editor:
Brian X. Chen suggests that we can hear the dialogue in movies and television shows better by installing new equipment. Along with the attempts at improvements made by directors and sound mixers, producers might insist upon better diction from the actors.
I've noticed this slurring and breathy quality in stage performers, too. Perhaps Broadway shows need closed captioning?

Airbrushing Older Models
To the Editor:
Re "Do Supermodels Age, or Get Airbrushed Instead?" (Sunday Styles, Aug. 20):
The timing couldn't be more prescient. Just as Greta Gerwig's irreverent blockbuster "Barbie" is sweeping theaters around the world, Vogue has released its iconic September issue featuring the likes of America's supermodels -- Linda Evangelista, 58, Cindy Crawford, 57, Christy Turlington, 54, and Naomi Campbell, 53 -- on its cover.
As Vanessa Friedman aptly remarks, they are "paragons of mature beauty whose years have seemingly been smoothed from their faces," which "look so retouched that they seem more like A.I.-generated bots than actual people." A Vogue spokeswoman claimed there was only "minimal retouching." We know better.
Although we can surely applaud Vogue's decision to feature 50-something models on its cover, "retouching" them is perpetuating a big lie. It is, in effect, "Barbiefying" them. Barbie was the icon that fed upon young girls' feelings of inadequacy. Now older women can gaze at Vogue's cover and feel inadequate too. Thank you, Vogue.
If Vogue, "the fashion Bible," had elected not to retouch these mature beauties, it would have been a truly groundbreaking event. Certainly a missed opportunity.
Thank you, Vanessa Friedman, for speaking truth to Vogue. As Ms. Gerwig's Barbie comes to realize, "It's time to change the Constitution."
Elizabeth Langer
New York
The writer is a co-founder of the Women's Rights Law Reporter, the first U.S. journal devoted to women and the law.
To the Editor:
I laughed this morning reading Vanessa Friedman's column at the silliness of an article criticizing the airbrushing of aging models. The fashion industry runs on unrealistic representations of beauty. Why should those standards be different for older models?
I've attended fashion shoots where young models had terrible acne that was ultimately airbrushed out. It seems that, no matter how young or beautiful a model is, there's almost always flattering lighting and image manipulation. The industry runs on fantasy.
So, whether or not older models have their wrinkles airbrushed seems irrelevant if everything is unrealistic. This is commerce. They aren't profiling women curing cancer. At least now they're democratizing fashion to allow older women to put their best selves forward, too.
I hope they can continue to do that without being criticized for tricks of the trade. I think focusing on airbrushing undermines how great it is that Vogue is keeping women over 50 relevant.

Haley's Raised Hand
To the Editor:
Re "Nikki Haley Is the Best Alternative to Trump," by David Brooks (column, Aug. 25):
Last week's Republican debate persuaded Mr. Brooks that Nikki Haley is the best alternative to Donald Trump. Yet while Mr. Brooks makes a convincing case that Ms. Haley is a preferable candidate to Mike Pence, Ron DeSantis and especially Vivek Ramaswamy, he fails to address the fact that Ms. Haley, along with every other candidate on the stage except Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson, raised her hand when asked if she would support Mr. Trump if he is convicted of one or more felonies and is the Republican nominee.
I would ask Mr. Brooks how Ms. Haley's raised hand shows that she is "one of the few candidates who understands that to run against Trump you have to run against Trump." And should that not, by itself, render her unfit to become the next president of the United States?

Sea Life in Captivity
To the Editor:
Re "Lolita the Orca, Mainstay of Miami Seaquarium for 50 Years, Dies," by Jesus Jiménez (news article, nytimes.com, Aug. 18):
I know I am not alone in grieving the tragedy of the kidnapping of this orca, also known as Tokitae, her decades spent in captivity, and her untimely death just when freedom and the possibility of being reunited with her family in the Salish Sea were close enough to touch. Her sorrowful life story hurts all the more because our human collective doesn't seem to have learned a thing from it.
Orcas remain endangered and continue to struggle to hear each other and catch dwindling salmon in polluted waters that are choking with boat noise from unceasing human commercial and recreational activity. Worse, the captive industry carries on, including in Seattle, which is intent upon building a shiny new shark tank to imprison even more animals.
My hope is that Tokitae's death will galvanize support against the captivity industry locally and beyond, and serve as a beacon of hope for other beings languishing in tanks simply so that they can be ogled by humans. Let's honor Tokitae and her bereaved family by ensuring that nobody else has to suffer similarly.

Criminal Stories From Beyond These Borders: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Four picks across television, film and podcast that will take American viewers and listeners to places with vastly different systems and understandings of justice.
The true crime genre can often feel very America-centric: Crimes that take place in the United States, with American perpetrators, victims and investigators. So the systems at play -- political, legal, cultural, press -- are all anchored to a similar playbook, and the failures and successes of these systems can feel repetitive.
But lately, more documentaries and podcasts take audiences far from American shores and immerse them in societies with very different customs and expectations -- and little in common with how crimes are approached, understood, pursued and solved in the United States. Here are four picks that will transport American viewers and listeners.
"Wanted: The Escape of Carlos Ghosn"
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This four-part docuseries on Apple TV+ takes viewers on a well-paced ride between Japan, France and Lebanon that involves an escape almost too fantastical for Hollywood. At its center is Carlos Ghosn, a Lebanese chief executive, born in Brazil and raised in Lebanon and France, with a Midas touch when it came to automakers. Among other feats, he brought Nissan back from the brink of failure about 25 years ago. By doing so, he became a glitzy and beloved figure in Japan, until he was arrested there for alleged financial wrongdoings.
Along the way -- through interviews with journalists, Ghosn's wife, his associates (business and otherwise) and Ghosn himself -- the stark differences in how executive compensation, justice, surveillance and criminal investigations are thought of and handled in these various countries are on display.
"Missing: The Lucie Blackman Case"
The police processes of Japan are explored from another angle in this Netflix documentary, which tells the story of Lucie Blackman, a 21-year-old British woman who was living and working in Tokyo when she went missing in 2000. Immediately after, her distraught family, led by her unyielding father, traveled there and -- after proving that they would not be dismissed or diminished -- spurred a massive search for her.
Cultural clashes frustrate the family and complicate the effort, and you may finish this documentary with as many questions as when you started (though they will be very different questions). Unlike many true-crime stories, there is closure to the case, and the outcome is shocking.
"Notes on a Scandal"
In this podcast, one of Pakistan's first in the true crime realm, we travel to Karachi in the late 1960s and early '70s, when the city's lust-fueled nightlife and high-society scandals would rival the most sensational eras of Hollywood or New York.
This story has it all: the mysterious death of a tortured poet, Mustafa Zaidi, whose body was found next to his unconscious muse and lover, the socialite Shahnaz Gul, renown for her beauty; a rumored suicide pact; an exhumation; a murder trial; breathless media coverage; and even revenge porn, which was not digital as we understand it today, but printed on thousands of fliers.
The show's hosts, Tooba Masood and Saba Imtiaz, Pakistan-based journalists, have been researching the circumstances surrounding Zaidi's death for years. Over two seasons, they share their findings in great detail, attempt to apply logic to the gossip of that time and debate the legitimacy of the possible scenarios. This is an independent podcast, and some might find the format -- a conversation between the hosts, with a couple of notable guests in Season 2 -- simplistic, but there is nothing simple or boring about the tale they've resurfaced.
"Rough Translation: Love Commandos"
In India, arranged marriage, as its known in the West, is simply known as marriage -- but marrying for love, which still accounts for only a small fraction of marriage there, is an anomaly called "love marriage." As we learn in "Love Commandos," the final season of NPR's "Rough Translation" podcast, love marriage can be a dangerous, even deadly, proposition for the young couples who follow their hearts instead of their parents' wishes.
In this five-episode podcast -- hosted by Gregory Warner, guest-hosted by Mansi Choksi and drawing on years of reporting by the NPR correspondent Lauren Frayer -- listeners are taken to modern-day India, where a mysterious Delhi-based group called Love Commandos has for about a decade offered shelter and safety to those who marry for love. Now, its leader, Sanjoy Sachdev, is facing allegations of extortion. As Warner puts it, "Escape is far from the same thing as freedom."
Over five episodes, we hear from couples who've lived at the Love Commandos compound and from Sachdev himself. But the possible crimes perpetrated by Sachdev in many ways take a back seat to some of the painful details that illustrate the prevalence and normalization of fear, harassment, abuse and human rights violations seemingly inherent to love marriages -- details that abound in nearly every story told.

Full text: A cinema chain in Britain is welcoming dogs to select screenings. They don't need their own tickets, and they don't need to turn off their cellphones.
Kab, a 2-year-old Doberman wearing a blue bandanna, is noticeably anxious.
Sometimes called "cupcake," he is roughly the size and weight of a teenage boy and has the energy to match. At the moment, he is being led around the courtyard of a cinema in East London by one of his owners, Luisa Fulcher, to walk off his jitters and allow for one last bathroom break before he and a handful of other dogs settle in for something unusual: their first moviegoing experience.
Last weekend, Curzon Cinemas, a chain with 16 locations in Britain, began allowing dogs to attend select movie screenings with their owners, starting with "Strays," an expletive-laden, live-action comedy that follows a group of dogs (voiced by actors including Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx) that unite to seek revenge on an owner.
London is a paradise for pooches, which are regularly found at the feet of their owners at restaurants, pubs, on trains and in many other public places. Movie theaters may be next to welcome dogs, thanks in part to the pandemic.
In Britain, which has a population of about 67 million people, there are an estimated 11 million pet dogs, according to a report this year by the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, a veterinary charity. Pet ownership surged during the pandemic, and now that workers are being encouraged to return to the office, some pets and their owners are struggling with the transition.
"A lot of people got dogs during the pandemic, and they want to come and see a film with their dog," said Jake Garriock, the head of publicity at Curzon. He said the new screenings were part of a larger program designed to let customers watch films in ways that best suit them, such as screenings for infants that feature reduced volume and increased lighting.
For now, Curzon is allowing dogs of any breed at only one screening a week, at only one of the chain's London locations, said Mr. Garriock. (And no, separate tickets are not required for dogs.) They're not allowed on the seats, and their owners must clean up any accidents.
Curzon is not alone in welcoming dogs. Picturehouse Cinemas, another British chain, has offered pup-friendly screenings since 2015, and there are numerous independent movie theaters in Britain that do so. (Most cinemas, however, allow only service dogs.)
Back outside the theater, Ms. Fulcher said she had brought a bone for Kab, who was now whimpering for attention and playfully jumping on this reporter.
"I think that it's a great idea because nowadays pets are part of the family," she said of the theater's new screenings. "They are not just pets anymore. It's like your little baby."
For other dog owners, the screenings provide a new freedom. Ziad Dajani said he and his partner had not been to the movies together in four years because of Tarçin, their 8-year-old Australian Labradoodle, who suffers from separation anxiety. "We're his hostages, basically," Mr. Dajani said. "So we can't leave him alone for a minute. Someone has to be with him all the time."
Standing in line to purchase snacks for the screening were a few other dog owners, including Rebecca Minty and her daughter. With them was Lottie, who was lying on the floor and not particularly bothered by anything or anyone. Ms. Minty said Lottie, a 7-year-old working cocker spaniel who does not work, was taken on a long run before coming to the theater in an effort to keep her calm.
Inside, the screening was like any other, except for the rustling of collars and the occasional bark. The movie's sound level was also dialed back.
"It's vital that cinemas reduce the sound at dog-friendly screenings, otherwise the volume could cause them distress and even pain," Dr. Katherine Polak, a veterinarian and a vice president at Humane Society International, said in a statement. "In principle, it's similar to cinemas that offer baby-friendly screenings that also reduce sound and accept that some level of disruption is likely."
Paget Fulcher, Kab's other owner, said after the screening that Kab had behaved well despite the challenges. "Most of the time, he was laying down on the ground, playing with a toy that we brought for him," he said. "It was all good. Nothing bad happened. I think we're very happy with how it went."
A dog's behavior at home offers clues as to how the animal might handle a movie screening, according to Graeme Hall, a British dog trainer known as "The Dogfather" who hosts the Netflix show "Dogs Behaving (Very) Badly."
"Some dogs seem to like watching the television, and some dogs don't notice," said Mr. Hall, who advised monitoring a dog for signs of stress, including making sounds, yawning, licking their lips and pinning back their ears.
He also said dogs take their cues from their owners. "We know for a fact that dogs are constantly looking at our facial expressions and body language, the little sounds we make, even our breathing patterns," he said. "If you're having a good time, there's a very good chance that your dog will pick up on that."
Mr. Garriock acknowledged that not everyone might enjoy going to a movie with dogs in the audience.
"Obviously, there's plenty of screenings where they won't be interrupted by dogs," he said. "If you like cats, then you can head to one of the other screenings."

LONDON — Kab, a 2-year-old Doberman wearing a blue bandanna, is noticeably anxious.

In Pursuit of Something Beyond Perfection: [Style Desk]

Full text: For years Elise Loehnen peddled wellness for Gwyneth Paltrow. Her new book explores "the price women pay to be good."
Last month, the author and podcast host Elise Loehnen joined Taryn Toomey, founder of the mind-body workout the Class, at a "Women's Intuition" workshop in TriBeCa. Ms. Loehnen spoke about her best-selling book, "On Our Best Behavior: The Seven Deadly Sins and the Price Women Pay to Be Good," which argues that women have long been culturally programmed to fear being "bad" and to suppress their emotions, their needs and their voices.
"The premise of today's workshop is to reconnect to that voice," she said. "To deepen it, to channel it, to find everything we've been taught to repress in our bodies and bring it to the surface."
As Ms. Loehnen read aloud a series of prompts (channel a fear of gluttony into a celebration of appetite, for instance), Ms. Toomey led the class through a series of exercises and spontaneous vocalizations. Afterward, each participant went home with a copy of Ms. Loehnen's book.
A couple of weeks later at her home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, Ms. Loehnen, 43, flashed a grin as she talked about how it felt to yell things like "Ha!" in front of a group of super-fit women in New York City. "I know Taryn, and I love the Class," she said. "But I have trouble making the sounds."
It is a new experience for Ms. Loehnen to speak with her own voice. She has ghostwritten or co-written a dozen other books, and for almost seven years worked at Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's wellness and lifestyle company, overseeing its blog, newsletter, book imprint and podcast as well as its Netflix documentary series, "The Goop Lab."
She chatted in the kitchen of her house, a small, airy and cunning design by the architect A. Quincy Jones. With her cropped dark hair and almost preternaturally glowing skin, she looked like a tomboy version of Snow White. Her husband and their two young sons were out.
The idea for the book, she said, came from a conversation with the celebrity therapist Lori Gottlieb on the Goop podcast. Pay attention to envy, Ms. Gottlieb told her: It can show you what you want. Ms. Loehnen began to consider envy's six unruly siblings-in-sin: lust, anger, greed, gluttony, sloth and pride.
In the book, Ms. Loehnen writes that the patriarchal structure of society has saddled women with damaging assumptions about goodness, leaving them exhausted, anxious, unable to express their true feelings and perpetually striving for an impossible-to-attain ideal. While she argues that men are also victims of the patriarchy, her message has especially resonated with women. On "The View," Sara Haines called the book "a deep dive into my own psyche of questioning everything."
John Evans, the co-owner of Diesel, a bookstore in Brentwood, said that the book's particular framing of "how women are trained to feel guilty about everything they do, and men are trained not to show their feelings" had struck a nerve with his customers.
"On Our Best Behavior" draws on history, sociology, philosophy, psychology, religion and science as well as personal experience. Ms. Loehnen caters to a broad constituency, an audience open to "woo-woo" theories as much as scientific ones.
In the book, she quotes in the same paragraph the biologist E.O. Wilson and the Jesus-channeling psychic medium Carissa Schumacher, whom she calls "one of my great spiritual teachers." On her podcast, "Pulling the Thread," her guests encompass a range of experts and thinkers: the NPR host Ari Shapiro; Dre Bendewald, a practitioner of "circling," in which women gather in circles to share their experiences; and Susan Olesek, a backer of the Enneagram, a model that sorts personality types.
Ms. Loehnen said that this reflected her curiosity and openness to ideas.
"We all contain multitudes, and I have always been quite democratic about where I get information," she said.
Ms. Loehnen grew up in Missoula, Mont., graduated from Yale in 2002 and began her career at Lucky magazine. She met Ms. Paltrow through the celebrity fitness instructor Tracy Anderson, with whom she had worked on a book project. She was hired as Goop's editorial director and later promoted to chief content officer.
Goop is many things: an aspirational lifestyle manifesto and a guide to expensive and sometimes wacky products; a source of anxiety, FOMO and, yes, envy. Many of these mixed feelings are directed at Ms. Paltrow, who presents herself as an everywoman of sorts while projecting an air of rarefied perfection. In interviews, several people who have worked there -- none of whom agreed to be quoted on the record -- described it as a workplace full of clashing ideas and employees immersed in competitive self-betterment while being hyperaware of each other's status in the company.
As much as Ms. Loehnen has tried to move past Goop, she can't liberate herself from its impact on how she is perceived. In an Instagram post last year, she explained that after leaving the company, "I felt like I was not in a healthy relationship with my body, where I was always trying to punish it and bring it under control." She then vowed "never to do another cleanse again," she said.
But, she went on, she realized that her new policy -- "two years of eating whatever my young kids want" -- was not healthy either. The result was a compromise: a "five-day reset of broths, smoothies and lattes" that allowed for eating extra food. "I refuse to punish myself with food, or hold myself under the weight my body seems to want to be anymore," she added. "Hopefully I've broken that cycle for good."
This single post started a media furor. Had Ms. Loehnen just attacked her former boss by implying that Goop's cleanses and detoxes -- it promotes a new one every year -- sent an unhealthy message about body image? Was she dissing Ms. Paltrow? No, Ms. Loehnen said, that's not what she meant at all. "People turned it into me being anti," she said, "but it wasn't an indictment of my last place of employment."
She chose her words carefully. You're not going to get her to say "Goop" or "Gwyneth," let alone criticize them. (Also, the company has an alert team of lawyers and an enthusiasm for NDAs.) Rumors still swirl that Ms. Loehnen's departure was less a conscious uncoupling than a forced march out the door. But Ms. Loehnen said that her departure was "pretty fast and mutual," and Ms. Paltrow issued a laudatory statement at the time.
Still. Was Ms. Paltrow angry about the Instagram post? "I don't know," Ms. Loehnen said; the two are no longer in touch.
As for her departure, Ms. Loehnen will say only that it was time to move on, and that the direction the company was going in -- selling more wellness products -- had become less interesting to her.
"My interests were moving out of this idea of self-optimization," she said. "I think what happens in the wellness world is this desire for control and certainty."
Ms. Loehnen said that she had a bit of a reset after leaving Goop. After being afflicted by an anxiety disorder that manifests as hyperventilation, she has found some equilibrium in giving up her quest for perfection.
"I don't think the answers are deep inside myself," she said. "If anything, the answers are in the collective, in recontextualizing ourselves and realigning ourselves with other women."
Case in point: She hasn't weighed herself since 2020, the year she left Goop.
"I had this experience when I was working on the book and looking at old photos, and I was like, 'God, I had a slamming body,"' she said. "And all I did back then was judge myself."

Full text: Inhospitable ghosts, a kid werewolf and Japanese zombies make up this month's scary picks.
'Bad Things'
Stream it on Shudder.
The writer-director Stewart Thorndike wrestles with ghosts in her new slow-burn haunted hotel film.
Ghosts as in spectral humans, like a little girl with disintegrating fingers, who spook the Red Roof-style motel that Ruthie (Gayle Rankin) inherits from her grandmother. Ghosts as in the emotional traumas that haunt Ruthie and the guests -- her partner, Cal (Hari Nef), their friend Maddie (Rad Pereira) and Maddie's guest, Fran (Annabelle Dexter-Jones) -- who join Ruthie at the motel to determine its fate. Then there's the phantom of "The Shining," a film Thorndike aspires to summon, down to the creepy joggers who might as well be Kubrick's menacing girls in grown-up athleisure wear.
Together, these spirits join forces in an unsettling and moving film about motherhood and bad memories, one that won't so much grab you by the throat as squeeze your hand. Thorndike sustains an eerie mood throughout, but wanders off course as the stakes become fuzzy in the final stretch, when a hospitality expert (Molly Ringwald, wonderful) appears to Ruthie, and a chain saw roars to life.
The film gets big assists from Jason Falkner's minimalist score and Grant Greenberg's cinematography that washes the Ithaca, N.Y., hotel where the film was shot in despairing hues.
'Enys Men'
Stream it on Hulu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mark Jenkin's unnerving folk horror fable joins "Skinamarink" and "The Outwaters" in this year's thrilling class of experimental horror films that give fear a form. Enigmatic and nightmarish, the film is about a woman known only as the Volunteer (Mary Woodvine), who spends her days alone on an isolated island off the British coast where she's charged with tending a terrain that seems to be overtaking her emotionally and physically. Did I say alone? The strange figures who haunt the landscape suggest otherwise.
Jenkin shot on a gloriously textural 16 millimeter, and uses many of the hallmarks of experimentalist cinema, like repetitive cuts and a warped score, to unsettle a sense of place and time. Figuring out what it adds up to -- a purging of personal traumas? a feminist response to misogynist evils? both? -- is the fun of watching this singular and lush but demanding movie that may test some horror fans' patience and desire for plot, so if it's a clearer and cleaner scare you want, look elsewhere.
'New Religion'
Stream it on Screambox.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In this penetrating Japanese film about loss, grief and self-forgiveness, the director Keishi Kondo paints a tortured picture of Miyabi (Kaho Seto), a divorced woman who at night works as a call girl, even as she mourns her young daughter who one minute was tending to plants on the family's apartment balcony and in a flash, disappears.
Miyabi has a new boyfriend (Ryuseigun Saionji), but their spark is flickering, which is why she's drawn to the attention showered on her by one of her clients, Oka (Satoshi Oka), a mysterious photographer. Miyabi agrees to let Oka take photos of her, and their sessions become a therapeutic way for her to process grief. But as Miyabi's grasp on reality loosens with each portrait, their macabre photo shoots take her on a darkly supernatural trajectory.
Kondo is both a precisionist and a full-throttle abstractionist; one minute he fills the screen with emotionally chilly drama and the next with expressionistic images of cocoons and bubbling landscapes. Moth motifs get heavy-handed as Miyabi's sorrow transforms into psychosis, but all is forgiven when the film so seamlessly blends a sensory visual experience with a moving study of a mother's anguish.
'Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead'

Akira (Eiji Akaso) hates his job, so the zombie apocalypse that hits Tokyo could not be better timed. "I don't have to go to work anymore!" he exclaims on a rooftop as a band of the hungry undead grab for him from behind a gate. That charmingly irreverent set up is what fuels Yusuke Ishida's zombie comedy, a live action adaptation of the eponymous manga.
The film's subtitle refers to Akira's list of "100 Things I Want to Do Before Becoming a Zombie," which includes riding a motorcycle (check!) and putting things in a shopping cart "without caring about price," a cinch considering his supermarket is empty save for the zombies that the eager-beaver Akira, who played American football in college, easily outmaneuvers.
The silliness that made the film so charming in the beginning becomes tiresome as the story moves away from Akira, a delightful protagonist, and instead relies on extended cat-and-mouse scenes that add little more than new characters. By the end of two, too-long hours, the walking monster shark (long story) and a heavy-handed message about individuality -- which may delight teen fans -- I was worn out.

If there's a common denominator in horror, it's the word don't. Don't go into the basement. Don't enter the woods. And don't mess with mothers, and that goes double for moms of monsters.
In Jacques Molitor's werewolf drama, the monster is Martin (Victor Dieu), one angry little boy. After he bites another kid, Martin's mother, Elaine (Louise Manteau), takes him to his dead father's Luxembourg estate where the boy's grandparents don't know she or Martin exist. The grandparents waste no time folding Martin into what his grandpa calls "a very old hunting family," one that makes Elaine feel like an outsider, especially when she's shocked to watch her son transform into a wolf. From there, the film stumbles as Molitor tries to figure out where to go next, and I wish the answer hadn't been to blow the whole thing up.
Werewolf movies have been queering horror since Lon Chaney Jr. got hairy in "The Wolf Man" in 1941, and this is a small effective addition. Any parent who has ever loved a child who's different will appreciate the story of a mama-bear protector and her young boy's monstrous coming-out.

Journey to the Top of 'Top Chef': [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: One day last week, a vase spilling over with white lilies and roses arrived in Kristen Kish's dressing room in Milwaukee, where "Top Chef" is shooting its 21st season.
Padma Lakshmi, the model and author who became a household name during the 17 years she hosted the cooking-competition show, had sent them, along with a note: "Break a leg. I'm so proud of you kiddo!"
For Ms. Kish, who was so nervous her first day on the set as Ms. Lakshmi's replacement that she thought she might throw up, the flowers were a balm.
"I know my job is to simply be me," Ms. Kish said, "but I feel like I am not going to be impressive enough to hold my own space and follow in Padma's footsteps."
Truth is, the aging "Top Chef" franchise, which has had its share of stumbles in an increasingly crowded constellation of food shows, needs her as much as she needs it. At 39, Ms. Kish represents a third wave of chef celebrity, far removed from pioneers like Emeril Lagasse and Bobby Flay, and the generation of tattooed, mostly white kitchen bros who followed.
Ms. Kish is a gay Korean adoptee and a proud product of the Midwest. She hits the notes sung by culinary stars before her: She co-wrote a cookbook, opened a restaurant and makes much of her living on camera, a skill she polished on several other shows before landing the "Top Chef" job in July. On social media, she toggles seamlessly between charming brand promotions, food tips and sincere declarations -- about love, self-care and even self-doubt -- that can border on oversharing.
Under all her casual confidence, she says, is a foundation of crushing insecurity.
"I have severe social anxiety and I'm on television, which is wild," she said. "I know I'm a walking contradiction."
That's hard to buy when you see her stride onto the set with the command of a model (which she once was). The show's stylist selected heeled boots and wide pants for her tall, lean body as a way to project authority. She broke into a goofy dance one moment, then hit her mark perfectly the next. The first time she uttered, "Please pack your knives and go" -- the chilling phrase Ms. Lakshmi delivered when a contestant was eliminated -- the crew applauded.
"Kristen is a megawatt," said Dana Cowin, the former editor in chief of Food & Wine and a "Top Chef" judge for seven seasons. She recently watched Ms. Kish confess her personal fears as she demonstrated how to make Korean-style corn dogs for a rapt audience at the Food & Wine Classic in Aspen, Colo. "She was just so vulnerable and open."
If Ms. Kish had a brand, it might be wrapped in millennial pink and laced with the ideals of a generation that values earnestness, diversity and being nice.
"She's been on a huge journey defining how we can be a chef in the post-celebrity-chef era and how we can think about our global community in a bigger way," said her friend Gregory Gourdet, the Portland, Ore., chef who was both a judge on the show and a finalist.
The Heir Apparent
It all started when Ms. Kish won "Top Chef" in 2013.
"She is completely a creature of the franchise," said Francis Lam, a frequent guest host and the vice president and editor in chief of Clarkson Potter, which published "Kristen Kish Cooking: Recipes and Techniques" in 2017. "On some level she can be a little bit of a cipher. People can put a lot on her based on their assumptions."
When Ms. Lakshmi announced that she would not renew her contract as the show's host and executive producer, Ms. Kish was the clear choice, said Casey Kriley, a chief executive of Magical Elves, the unscripted-production company that created the show. Executives at NBCUniversal, which owns Bravo, the network it airs on, never interviewed anyone else, said Ryan Flynn, a senior vice president.
"She checks all the boxes," he said.
Ms. Kish got word that "Top Chef" wanted her while flying back to the East Coast with her wife, Bianca Dusic, after doing promotional work for a hotel in Thailand.
"I was shocked," she said. "I really wasn't pushing for this because I never thought it was actually a possibility."
Ms. Lakshmi was the first person she called. "I hope I've been a sounding board for her over the last decade," Ms. Lakshmi wrote in an email. "I've made it my mission to mentor young women like her because I didn't have that coming up."
Ms. Lakshmi, a victim of sexual assault, often spoke out about sexual harassment in the restaurant industry, including accusations against a "Top Chef" winner, and pushed to make the show less Eurocentric.
Ms. Kish said that although she will have no problem being blunt if she has to, she intends to focus on the work, not the politics.
"TV is populated by people who love to hear their own voice," said Hugh Acheson, a chef who made his name with restaurants in Georgia and was a judge on the show for six seasons. "And that isn't Kristen at all."
Tom Colicchio, the chef who serves as the show's head judge, said he was excited to have someone new in the mix, especially an experienced chef. "She knows what she's doing," he said.
Gail Simmons, the show's other judge and a close friend of Ms. Kish, didn't think she needed much advice: "The only concern I had was her own self-doubt."
Under Control
A precise and focused cook with French and Italian influences, Ms. Kish has long relied on organization to counter her anxiety. Growing up in a suburb of Grand Rapids, Mich., she kept a whiteboard in her room to keep track of her schoolwork, piano lessons and sports. Her older brother, Jonathan, an automotive engineer, gave her a cordless vacuum as a housewarming present when she recently moved to Connecticut with the Australian-born Ms. Dusic. She uses it every day she's home.
Ms. Kish is much looser about what she eats and wears. She prefers hoodies and a ball cap turned backward. Her favorite cosmetic is Carmex. She'd just as soon eat chicken tenders, sour candy and squares of presliced Colby-Jack cheese on a saltine.
The Hamburger Helper that brought her joy as a child inspired a pasta dish of curly edged mafaldine tossed with mushrooms and pearl onions that is popular at her Austin restaurant, Arlo Grey.
This baffles her mother, Judy Kish. "I truly did not use Hamburger Helper very often," she said during a recent family interview on Zoom. "I really don't understand why it's so vivid in her memory, to tell you the truth."
The elder Ms. Kish was a high school teacher, and her husband, Michael, was an engineer at a company that made corrugated cardboard boxes. In 1984, the couple adopted the four-month-old Kristen, who had been abandoned shortly after birth at a clinic outside Seoul.
They strove to keep her connected to her birth country, making sure she tasted kimchi, introducing her to a Korean exchange student and reading her "The Korean Cinderella" by Shirley Climo. (Ms. Kish had the story spray-painted on the restroom walls of her restaurant. Speakers softly play a recording of a woman reading it in Korean.)
For a long time, Ms. Kish tried not to think about her Korean roots. "I put it aside because I was scared that I was going to find out something that I didn't want to find out about where I actually came from," she said.
Still, in her 20s, she had her Korean name and adoption case number inked on her wrist -- the first of many tattoos marking important moments in her life.
After she won "Top Chef," she vowed to use some of the $ 125,000 prize money to visit South Korea, but couldn't go through with it. Nine years later, Netflix sent her to Seoul on a five-day promotional trip tied to her work as a host on "Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend." She didn't search out orphanages, as some adoptees do. Instead, she focused on learning about the food.
Can someone who didn't grow up in a Korean family legitimately cook the cuisine? It's a question she grapples with.
"I'm trying to own that side of me so it doesn't feel like I'm appropriating a culture that doesn't belong to me," she said. "I clearly can have a point of view about Korean American food. There is a connection. I'm allowed to explore it. But for a long time I felt guilty about it."
An Education in Fame
Despite her shyness as a child, she had a lot of friends. By high school she was firmly ensconced with the preps.
"We had Abercrombie clothes, and I had purple contacts," she said. "I was trying to be everything except me. I wanted to hide."
Especially, she said, her budding attraction to women.
Her grades weren't good enough to get into Michigan State University, where her brother and both her parents graduated. She spent a year at Grand Valley State University, but didn't go back. Her parents, who said she always had a creative streak with food, sent her to Chicago to attend Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts. She loved it and graduated, but also discovered cocaine and the bars.
"A lot of it was trying to mask and self-medicate my social anxiety and my sexuality," she said. Ms. Kish convinced herself that being successful couldn't include being gay.
She kept partying, turning down jobs she thought were beneath her. Finally, her parents stopped paying for her nice apartment. She moved back home, depressed and defeated.
They gave her one more chance. They knew of a room for rent in Boston, and offered to help pay for it if she found a job within three weeks.
She did, cooking in a series of kitchens that led to a job at Stir, a cookbook store and demonstration kitchen owned by the chef and restaurateur Barbara Lynch. Ms. Lynch became a mentor, passing her name to producers who had called looking for new "Top Chef" contestants.
Ms. Lynch wrote a letter that Ms. Kish had in her back pocket when she won. "So very proud of you," it read. "Breathe and most of all enjoy the experience!!"
Ms. Kish doesn't have much to say about recent reports that Ms. Lynch verbally and physically harassed workers at her restaurants.
"I had been removed from her company for 10 years, so I don't know," Ms. Kish said. "What I do know is that if she never said, 'Kristen, you can win Top Chef,' none of this would be happening. And that's a fact."
Over a cheeseburger at Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan last month, Ms. Kish pondered how to navigate her fast-rising fame. She guards the name of the town where she lives, and is careful what she says when she's out somewhere, because people eavesdrop. She is trying to get better at responding to the strangers who approach her in places like the supermarket.
"When I get insecure and uncomfortable and socially anxious, I kind of become, for lack of a better term, a bitch," Ms. Kish said. Ms. Dusic prompts her to snap out of it with a code phrase: "Nasty Nancy's here."
The two met when Ms. Dusic was the corporate executive assigned to help Ms. Kish open her Austin restaurant in the LINE Hotel in 2018. After six months of intense work side by side, they shared a high-five that lasted a little longer than they expected.
They were married in their backyard in April 2021. As with their engagement, Ms. Kish announced it on Instagram.
Ms. Dusic, 44, left the restaurant industry when the stress of working during the Covid shutdowns and grief over her father's death from cancer made her sick. Now she is a "mind-set and transformation coach" who offers breath work and other therapies, which she uses to help Ms. Kish. She also has persuaded Ms. Kish to stop ordering so much takeout.
Ms. Dusic frequently accompanies Ms. Kish when she works. At home, they putter in the garden, drink tea and are in bed by 10 p.m. It's all about managing a life that just keeps getting bigger.
"This was never the plan," Ms. Kish said. "The plan would have been for me to just work in a little restaurant, making ends meet, doing my life and just keep trucking along."

How Does Kristen Kish Feel at the Top of ‘Top Chef’? It’s Complicated.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Here You Come Again" and "On Cedar Street" are very different new musicals about people who are unmoored and seek companionship to make it through.
There is little to be gained from getting overly attached to source material. When a story told first in one form is adapted into another, it becomes a different creature -- in the details and sometimes the broad outlines, too. So it goes with art; so has it ever gone.
And yet I ask for a special dispensation in the case of the new musical, "On Cedar Street," onstage through Sept. 2 at the Berkshire Theater Group's Unicorn Theater in Stockbridge, Mass. The show is inspired by Kent Haruf's slender final novel from 2015, "Our Souls at Night," about how two widowed, small-town neighbors, Addie and Louis, gingerly find their way into each other's lives after she proposes a remedy for their loneliness: that they start sleeping together platonically, for conversation and companionship.
The book is a quiet, gentle thing, and it takes its time, layering in the details of Addie and Louis's pasts and presents. Each has been lonely since long before their spouses died: his marriage marred by a scandalous affair, hers numbed by the death of a child. When Addie's young grandson, Jamie, comes to stay with her, he's lonely at first, too, and scared of the dark.
But the novel's forlorn heart is nowhere to be found in "On Cedar Street," which has a book by Emily Mann; music by Lucy Simon ("The Secret Garden"), who died last October, and Carmel Dean; and lyrics by Susan Birkenhead. Directed by Susan H. Schulman, who staged "The Secret Garden" on Broadway, the musical presents Addie (Lauren Ward, in excellent form) and Louis (Stephen Bogardus, not quite disappearing into the role) as essentially fine with being alone, despite Addie's comic difficulty with sleeping solo, which we witness in her toss-and-turn opening number.
"I prefer the single life," Addie and Louis sing early on, and though they're skittish about getting romantically involved, they recognize that that's exactly what they're doing. Addie didn't pick her one hot widowed neighbor for nothing. Like the middling Netflix film adaptation of the novel, starring Jane Fonda and Robert Redford, this production is definitely a beautiful-people incarnation of the tale.
The ache of aloneness is gone, though, and with it the sense of two people cautiously choosing each other, trying not to unduly disturb their respective ghosts. And despite a physical design that's all patchwork and wood, evoking a kind of sun-dappled Middle America, "On Cedar Street" has mostly discarded the straitening social pressure that Addie and Louis, in the novel, are rebelling against -- taunting the local gossips by choosing happiness. (The set is by Reid Thompson, projections by Shawn Edward Boyle.)
"On Cedar Street" skitters along, too busy for depth. At 105 minutes, it feels both scant and overcrowded, with narrative context pared away to make space for inorganic plot lines that seem like bids for timely social resonance: one involving a dangerous drought and another a left-winger-vs.-right-winger battle between Addie's friend Ruth (Lana Gordon) and her neighbor Lloyd (Lenny Wolpe).
Ruth serves one laudable new purpose in the musical, though: urging Addie to stand up to her grown son, Gene (Ben Roseberry), who treats her abominably and gets away with it because he blames himself for the accidental death of his sister when they were children. With his pain approximately one cell beneath the surface of his skin, he is forever ready to burst into emotionally lucid song.
But Jamie (Hayden Hoffman), Gene's 8-year-old son, is missing the tender vulnerability that the story needs from the child. That isn't the fault of the actor; a high school student, he is simply too old for the role. Jamie's dog, Charley, is played by a sandy-furred stage veteran named Addison. (Animal direction and training are by William Berloni; Rochelle Scudder is the dog handler.)
The score, which includes additional music by Deborah Abramson, is a mixed bag stylistically. Much of the music is lovely, but almost no songs get the affective underpinning from the show that would make them land with any impact. The closest it gets to poignant is "The Girl We Were," with strings underneath Addie's remembrance of the passionate soul she used to be. (Music direction is by Kristin Stowell.)
It's Charley, ultimately, who elicits a moment of genuine emotion toward the finish of "On Cedar Street" -- an overly neat ending (albeit an improvement on the novel's) orchestrated by way of the drought plot line. A forest fire is involved, which might seem terribly of the moment, but then again so is loneliness.
This spring, the U.S. Surgeon General released a report titled Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation, warning of the need for social connection and the dire harm that its absence can bring. Addie, Louis and Jamie are prime examples -- first of the ailment, then of the cure -- if only "On Cedar Street" would let them be.
Loneliness is far more top of mind in the hallucinatory new jukebox comedy "Here You Come Again," running through Aug. 27 at Goodspeed Musicals' Terris Theater in Chester, Conn. The mind in question is barely hanging on.
Kevin (Matthew Risch), an aspiring comic, has left New York for Texas in the early, planet-on-pause days of the pandemic. In May 2020, he is isolating in the attic of his childhood home. (The set is by Anna Louizos.) Pictures of his idol, Dolly Parton, hang on the wooden walls; downstairs, his parents watch Fox News. On the verge of being officially dumped by his hedge-fund-guy boyfriend back in Manhattan, Kevin is feeling fragile.
But when he wakes to find Dolly (Tricia Paoluccio) in the room with him, he is less comforted than confused.
"Hey, little buddy," she says, with the beneficence of a Tennessee guardian angel making a surprise appearance. "I've been keeping my eye on everyone during the pandemic, and I could feel your need for some extra help."
This phantasmic Dolly is a charmer, and in her sparkles and stilettos and butterfly sleeves, she makes sense as the hero of a pandemic musical. (Costumes are by Bobby Pearce.) The real Parton spent the spring of 2020 donating to coronavirus research and reading bedtime stories to children online. The Dolly here is similarly generous, singing more than a dozen numbers: "Love Is Like a Butterfly," "Jolene," "I Will Always Love You" and other hits. (The music director is Eugene Gwozdz.)
Paoluccio, who wrote the musical's book with Bruce Vilanch and the show's director-choreographer, Gabriel Barre, is a fun, fluid Dolly, bubbly and confiding. Because this Dolly exists in Kevin's imagination, she doesn't have to match the real one precisely, but she is close enough. One caveat: Paoluccio goes distractingly hard on Dolly's sometime tendency to pronounce "s" like "sh."
It is Kevin's story, though, and its telling needs more balancing and tightening. Unmoored from the life he'd been living and the home he'd made before the world abruptly got small, he is awash in self-pity -- an unappealing quality when humor isn't there to buoy it. The show also needs grounding in a reality outside the attic, to give it the emotional gravity it wants; the offstage voice of Kevin's mother (Risch) could provide that if she were played straight rather than as a caricature.
In its current state, "Here You Come Again" is unpolished, but Parton's music makes it an easy good time. That, and Dolly's company -- even if we're imagining her, too.

Horrifying Options As Summer Fades: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: On the big screen, under the stars or in your living room, there are plenty of frights to catch up with before fall's serious season arrives.
No matter if you're a horror die-hard or an occasional toe-dipper, here's an end-of-summer guide to slashers, thrillers, creature features, kid comedies and other scary movies.
Grab a Seat
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The buzzy new horror movie in theaters is "Talk to Me," an Australian demon-possession film by the brothers Danny and Michael Philippou. Despite some messy storytelling -- does anybody work at the local hospital? -- it's a propulsive movie about trauma, parenthood and the afterlife that manages to be both harrowing and tender.
New York's repertory theaters are always offering opportunities to discover or revisit horror's past. The Alamo Drafthouse has two very different creepy films on tap: "Psycho," the groundbreaking and still terrifying 1960 proto-slasher (Aug. 18, 20 and 22 at the exhibitor's Staten Island location), and "Killer Workout" (Aug. 22, Brooklyn), a 1987 schlocky slasher about an aerobics studio under siege from a maniac.
Take a time machine to grindhouse-era sleaze at the Nighthawk in Williamsburg, which is showing "The Honeymoon Killers" (Aug. 23), a 1970 thriller based on the lives of Martha Beck and Ray Fernandez, otherwise known as the Lonely Hearts Killers.
Laptop, schmaptop: See it big in "See It Big," a series dedicated to 70-millimeter films now at the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. The disaster film is a horror-adjacent genre that warms my fear-seeking heart, so I'd go with a progenitor: "Airport," (Aug. 25-26), the 1970 camp-as-heck drama with a starry cast that includes Burt Lancaster, Dean Martin and Jacqueline Bisset.
Brooklyn's Spectacle Theater is known for its out-in-left-field repertory programming. Its Dark Side of Summer series hits a Gen X home run with "Cutting Class" (Aug. 19 and 24), a wacky 1989 high school slasher-comedy starring a baby-faced Brad Pitt and a sourpussed Roddy McDowall.
"What better way to cool down in the sweltering August heat than by watching two chilling black-and-white gay serial killer flicks?" That's how Anthology Film Archives bills its experimental double feature on Aug. 18, part of the Narrow Rooms series of subversive queer cinema. On tap are "Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men" (1989), a wordless cinematic adaptation of a theater piece about the serial killer Dennis Nilsen, and "Pig" (1998), a short film about a ritual murder.
Make a Night of It
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
If it's too hot to open the front door, I say turn the lights out, crank up the AC and stream some of the year's most popular horror movies, including "Scream VI" (Paramount+), "M3gan" (Amazon Prime Video), "Evil Dead Rise" (Max), "Infinity Pool" (Hulu) and "Knock at the Cabin" (Peacock).
For new international horror, head to Netflix. Two recent standouts include "The Strays," a dark drama about secret traumas that haunt a family in suburban England, and "Troll," a teen-friendly, folk-horror creature feature about a towering moss-covered monster that ravages Norway.
Tubi, the ad-supported streaming service, has a terrific roster of classic horror, including "Ringu" (1998) and "Last House on the Left" (1972). But for a Friday night at home with friends and pasta -- manicotti, to be exact -- you can't get funnier than the new adults-only gross-out animated comedy "Pastacolypse," about a chef named Alfredo Manicotti who turns into a maniacal noodle monster out to corrupt a gluten-free world.
Two of the year's most experimental and renegade horror movies are streaming, too. "Skinamarink," now on Hulu, is a starkly minimalist and macabre mood piece about children and the night terror they encounter inside their home. "The Outwaters," on Screambox, is a brutal and gory film -- an experience, really -- about an entity that assaults a group of friends in the Mojave Desert. Consider yourself warned.
Get Out
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A sweeping view of Times Square is a perk of the Rooftop Cinema Club, which shows films atop the Embassy Suites Hotel on West 37th Street in Manhattan. Horror movies on the calendar include the comedy "Scary Movie" (Aug. 20) slasher classic and the family-friendly comedy "The Addams Family" (Sept. 1). But my must-see pick is "Jennifer's Body" (Sept. 3), a deeply unsettling feminist fable from 2009 about the aftermath of a woman's traumatic sexual assault.
Some of my favorite childhood memories are watching scary (but not too scary) movies by moonlight. The 2022 animated sci-fi adventure "Strange World" (Aug. 26) is showing for free at Police Officer Nicholas Demutiis Park in Queens as part of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation's Movies Under the Stars series.
Take a Ride
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Creepy costumes and a hunger for nostalgia are encouraged at the Rosendale Theater in Rosendale, N.Y., an Ulster County cinema about a two-hour drive from New York City. The theater has a robust calendar of genre movies all year, but I'm a fan of its Saturday Creature Features series. The theater is showing a gem, "Them!" (Aug. 19), the gonzo 1954 B-movie about larger-than-life monster ants who tear up Los Angeles.
Over Labor Day weekend, the Mahoning Drive-in in Lehighton, Pa., about a 90-minute drive from New York, is hosting "Camp Blood," a 35-millimeter camping-themed horror movie extravaganza. The schedule is heavy on slashers, including "The Burning," a 1981 revenge slice-and-dicer with Jason Alexander and Holly Hunter (to be followed by an actual campfire); "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter," the of-course-not-final film in the slasher franchise, from 1984; and "Sleepaway Camp," the queer but controversial vengeance fantasy that turns 40 this year.
The weekend includes raffles, live music and games, including an eyeball toss and the Crystal Lake Morgue Body Bag Race. I recommend visiting hungry: The concessions, including vegan options and my favorite, pierogies, are affordable and pigout-worthy.

Are Comedian Bots Ready to Kill?: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Last month, in the crowded back room of a bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the fate of humanity hung in the balance.
Or at least that's how Matt Maran, a bro-y comic from Queens, portrayed it. He was bidding for sympathy during what was billed as the first roast battle pitting artificial intelligence against a human comedian.
It didn't work. Maran lost the crowd early with a joke that riffed on the idea that women aren't funny. His opponent was a ChatGPT-powered version of Sarah Silverman, the comic who, as it happens, had sued the developer behind that chatbot for copyright infringement earlier in the week. On a screen nearby, her head shook back and forth. "Why did the human stare at the glass of orange juice?" it asked in a close approximation of her girlish voice. "They were trying to concentrate." Then oddly, it proclaimed: "Roasted!"
Neither side was getting big laughs, but the A.I. was more unflappable, moving from quip to quip with the pace of a metronome. Some of its jokes were simple similes ("You're as edgy as a butter knife") and at least one didn't make sense, but the bot drew blood with a punchline that used details from Maran's jokes: "You're from Long Island and you lost your virginity to a prostitute. Talk about starting from the bottom and staying there." Maran looked defeated even before the image of Silverman was replaced by one of him. Then he got roasted by the digital version of himself. Humanity lost every round.
It's tempting to conclude that this defeat was an existential sign of the looming robot takeover of comedy, but the face-off felt closer to your grandfather playing computer chess than to Garry Kasparov vs. Deep Blue. But the event did drive home an important point about one of the many current anxieties surrounding A.I.: If the human lock on humor is coming to an end, the blame will lie with our complacency as much as technological progress.
Until recently, comedy has been seen as so quintessentially human that it was assumed A.I. would kill humanity before it would at a club. But since the rise of large language models like ChatGPT less than a year ago, this common wisdom no longer applies.
A.I.'s potential displacement of humans has become a central issue in the labor disputes in Hollywood. Jimmy Kimmel has told jokes written by ChatGPT on his show in February, and once-cautious computer scientists are now predicting it will only be a matter of years before robots are regularly generating professional comedy. The accomplished comic writer Simon Rich appeared shook after using code-davinci-002, a bot not available to the public. When he asked it for a parody headline for the conflict started by Russia, it responded: "Experts Warn That War in Ukraine Could Become Even More Boring." Rich said he didn't think he could beat it and "and certainly not instantaneously, for free."
There's no question that A.I. can think faster than any comedian can and study the mechanics of a joke with more agility than ever before. And even if irony and tone can still be challenging, its sense of humor will only improve. It's worth recalling that in the 1990s, supercomputers lost to chess grandmasters before they started winning. But comedy is not chess. And whether A.I. can intentionally generate truly funny art is as much a philosophical as a technological question.
THE MOST COMMON CASE AGAINST MACHINES is that by design, they don't come up with new ideas so much as collect and synthesize old ones. And comedy, whether it's Tim Robinson, "South Park" or Ali Wong, depends on novelty and surprise.
Tony Veale, a computer scientist who wrote a book on comedy and A.I., "Your Wit Is My Command," is impressed with new large-language models' ability to imitate genre and voice, analyze and generate metaphors, explain itself and even admit mistakes. He's bullish on computers making professional-level jokes in five years and when asked about originality responded that A.I.'s process isn't any different from that of young artists. "Many comedians, such as Eddie Murphy and Jerry Seinfeld, trained themselves by repeatedly listening to and repeating Bill Cosby's early comedy albums," he wrote in an email. "We all learn from those we aim to emulate and transcend."
He's got a point. Plus: Much comedy doesn't get that far past the imitation stage. People like old jokes. Sitcoms and stand-up are often derivative. Topical comedy often leans on formulaic phrasing and predictable rhythms. It's why the form most vulnerable to disruption (and displacement of jobs) might be late-night television, featuring hosts delivering sets, which comedians typically take months or years to develop.
On the cutting edge of this work is Joe Toplyn, who studied engineering and edited The Harvard Lampoon before writing jokes for "Late Night With David Letterman," where he helped come up with the concept of throwing watermelons off a five-story building (a very human idea). Toplyn has created a bot called Witscript that takes a headline or thought and spits out three jokes, then picks the best one.
In a demonstration at a conference last September, he presented two examples of what he considered "human-level" jokes that he claimed would make you chuckle if delivered by a friend. In one, he put in this prompt: "Some casinos are using fine-arts exhibitions to bring in new business" and Witscript responded: "I lost my Monet but gained a Jackson Pollock." In another, Toplyn typed in "I'm thinking about growing a mustache" and the punchline was: "Tom Selleck called -- he wants his look back."
The only thing funny about these is their corniness. And yet, how confident are you that they aren't a quick rewrite away from being ready for Jimmy Fallon? Toplyn was one of the head writers of "The Chevy Chase Show" (1993), one of the most infamous flops in the history of television, so he knows how much quality on late night can vary.
Comics have always been quicker than other artists to experiment with technology -- Whitney Cummings had an eerie robot version of herself tell jokes on a Netflix special in 2019 -- and most of the half dozen or so I talked to who did use some form of A.I. to make jokes seemed underwhelmed. Bill Oakley is a veteran of "The Simpsons" who, along with Josh Weinstein, produced many classic episodes, including "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" He asked a bot to write an episode in their style. The result, about a bees infestation, was "on the level of a seventh-grade fan," he said.
Chris Onstad, who writes the comic Achewood, had more success, in part because he was involved with engineers in creating a bot that would issue an advice column in the voice of one of his characters. But he still sees A.I. as more of a tool than a threat. "It's coming for fan fiction and pulp," he told me during a video call, "but not high-quality literature."
The problem is we live in an age that delights in fan fiction and pulp and too often overlooks literature. The internet replaced some of the power of human gatekeepers with algorithms -- essentially a simpler form of A.I. -- that recommend content for you on Spotify or YouTube. In media and culture today, a greater premium is placed on producing work quickly and in volume, an approach that already benefits computers more than humans. As swagger has moved from Hollywood to Silicon Valley, and English majors have become increasingly scarce, our culture has lost some confidence in the ineffable, essential qualities of human creativity.
FROM PLATO TO HOBBES TO FREUD, intellectuals have long offered theories of comedy. But over the past generation or two, there's been a dramatic rise in the number of people treating art as a problem to be solved, a mystery to figure out and teach. An industry of gurus and critics and educators breaks jokes down into component parts. Upright Citizens Brigade was a hit for a time not only because its shows built on the success of their classes, but also because it created a system of comedy that leaned more on structure and rules than its improv predecessors did. Revealingly, in an interview, one of their co-founders, Ian Roberts, compared the U.C.B. approach to "the principles of physics."
Every artistic field now seems to have its Robert McKee, whose popular screenwriting classes teach genre, plot and character with definitiveness. Toplyn was part of this wave, publishing a book on how to write late-night jokes. He broke down monologues, desk pieces and parodies with practical theories on how they work. And he used these conclusions to train his bot.
There is insight to be gleaned from Toplyn, McKee and the U.C.B. But at the heart of their entire enterprise is a lie, or at least a simplification. No theory of comedy that I have read captures it all because art can't be boiled down to a recipe. And jokes, which include everything from puns and pratfalls to shaggy dog stories and satirical barbs, are especially varied and complex. As the cartoonist Saul Steinberg put it: "Trying to define humor is one of the definitions of humor."
In an introduction to a new book of poems produced by A.I., "I Am Code," the poet Eileen Myles is shown the work and finds it badly derivative. There's already a program producing formulaic poetry, Myles says, before quipping: "It's called the M.F.A."
There are elements of math to comedy and poetry (iambic pentameter requires an ability to count), but we must not reduce them to that. The subconscious, the source of much creativity, cannot be mapped so neatly. And the closer you look at great art, the more you realize that parts of it cannot be entirely explained or predicted. This is especially true for comedy. The funniest aspects are often those that resist logic. A.I. will figure out sarcasm before silliness.
To use the most popular blockbuster of the summer, Weird Barbie is the funniest one. That said, Stereotypical Barbie gets a different kind of laugh, one that might help explain that rout at the roast battle. Rigid characters trying and failing to escape their mechanistic situation is classically funny. (Think of Charlie Chaplin trapped in the gears or Lucille Ball at the chocolate factory.) Henri Bergson, one of the first great modern philosophers of humor, who was wise enough to reject "imprisoning the comic spirit in a definition," saw comedy as a corrective to Industrial Age automatism. He believed that we laughed as a response to people acting like machines.
Bergson saw comedy as distinctly human. That may be in part because he understood that it's deeply, inescapably social. We not only laugh more in groups, but also what we find funny depends on who is telling the joke. A punchline about a car crash will be hilarious to one person and offensive to another. Artificial intelligence can come up with jokes, but it can require emotional intelligence to make them work. What makes people crack up is not just the joke but also the connection with a human consciousness telling it.
Maybe audiences could make a similar connection with a sophisticated computer of the future, but the Catch-22 for A.I. humor is the further it gets from seeming human, the more unfunny it seems, but the closer the imitation, the creepier it becomes as it falls deeper into the uncanny valley. After the robot revolution, what may save human comedy from irrelevance is our own deep-seated tribal biases. We like to laugh at our own.
COMEDY BY ROBOTS is more likely to succeed as a tool behind the scenes -- or in disguise. One of the more successful recent attempts at integrating A.I. into comedy suggests as much.
Curious to see if A.I. could be funny, Jason Woliner, best known for directing "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm," built a crude cowboy robot named Dale using speech-synthesis software and ChatGPT. He gave it a grizzled character, training it to speak in monologues filled with folksy metaphors and old-timey locutions like "I reckon." Woliner tried him out at a party at his house where guests could ask Dale questions.
"It was kind of captivating," he said of the conversations. "The A.I. was filtered through this character, so it didn't have that creepiness. It was like a parlor trick from the 1800s or something."
This was a warm-up for a July show at a Los Angeles theater based on the conceit that Woliner was presenting his own career retrospective. Dale delivered a scripted introduction and then interviewed his creator, receiving some prompts backstage from Eric Notarnicola, a collaborator on this project. About half of what Dale said came from the A.I., half was written. But importantly, Woliner said, he didn't tell the audience he was using A.I.
"That would be a cheat," he explained, leaving the crowd to wonder if the voice came from a person or was prerecorded. Dale got laughs. Some from the rambling Old West oddness of its style, but not only that. After listening to Woliner talk about working with Jim Belushi, Dale killed when he quipped, "Did you ever think the wrong Belushi died?"
Woliner sounded almost uneasy confessing that this experiment made him hopeful about A.I., pointing out that losing jobs is a serious concern and merits the striking writers' fight for a new deal. Human creativity, he believes, is not replaceable, but it is able to integrate this new technology in exciting, creative ways. With Dale, he found a "a new tone" to play with and plans to continue to work with it.
The conversation about A.I. today gravitates toward doomsday scenarios, but consider the utopian outcome, that bots don't replace comics but become useful tools. That feels modestly realistic. The ideal, it seems to me, is that artificial intelligence gives comedians incentive to abandon the more generic forms of their work, the predictable and hack, and inspires them to be more eccentric, personal and original. Competition from increasingly clever computer programs will force artists to not only rely more on intuition than imitation, but also to think harder about what makes them, and their work, distinctly human.
Our advantage in the comedic battle with machines is that human flaws are always funnier than any kind of perfection. What if A.I. pushed comedy to become more ambitious? A critic can dream.

Full text: Judy Gold loves Provincetown, Mass., where she has been performing since 1992, but she hates the slow drivers.
Judy Gold owes her comedy career to a dare. One night while she was attending Rutgers University, a classmate challenged her to do stand-up in a student lounge, Ms. Gold recalled. "That was the first laugh I got," she said. "It was the most amazing feeling, like an out-of-body experience."
Forty years -- and two books, three albums, three solo shows, a slew of comedy specials and a podcast later -- Ms. Gold, 60, is still making people laugh. She now does it three times a week in a one-woman show, "Everything Hurts Everywhere All at Once," running through Sept. 3 at the Post Office Cafe and Cabaret in Provincetown, Mass.
Though Ms. Gold has lived in a rental apartment on the Upper West Side for decades, she purchased a three-bedroom condo in Provincetown in 1994. During the summer, she lives there with her fiancée, Elysa Halpern, 61, a therapist, whom she met on a blind date arranged by Time Out New York in 2007. They're sometimes joined by Ms. Gold's two children, Henry, 26, and Ben, 22.
NO TRIGGERS The alarm clock here is broken, so at 9 a.m. I wake up to Sonata in E Major by Scarlatti on my iPhone. I have a hard time getting out of bed because I suffer from diurnal depression and alarms are triggers. Classical music, which I love, doesn't assault my brain. I might do a nine-minute snoozy.
COFFEE AND A SONG I go downstairs to make coffee and I hear Elysa singing, which she does when she wakes up. I love that about her. Right now she's into "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia." My current grind is Kicking Horse Coffee's Grizzly Claw. I drink it black and strong -- I'm a purist.
READY TO GO I put on my tennis clothes and go outside to get The Times, because they don't put it on my doorstep. I stretch on the floor for five minutes and then make us a shake with almond milk, whey protein, berries, bananas, powdered peanut butter, kale and chia seeds. Then I put my tennis bag together and pack two bottles of water: one with ice, the other with watermelon-flavored Liquid I.V., my favorite of these little packets.
SLOW COMMUTE By 11 a.m. we leave for tennis. It's only two miles, but in the summer it can take 15 minutes because everyone is driving five miles an hour on Bradford Street, which makes me crazy. I'm not a relaxed person -- it's my New York angst. I've discussed this in therapy multiple times.
HOLDING COURT We love the Provincetown Tennis Club. It's something out of a WASP-y New England Jane Austen novel. It's very social and friendly. I love doubles -- it's like a chess game filled with strategy. Sometimes we see Billie Jean King or Delia Ephron. I have a Wilson racket, which we spin to see who goes first by calling "wine" or "margarita." We play for the next 90 minutes. Then we sweep the courts, drive back home and scream at how slow everyone is.
ON THE SAND We change into our bathing suits and make sandwiches. Usually it's turkey and Provolone with lettuce, tomato and avocado on whole wheat. I like hot chili relish mayo; Elysa likes mustard. And Cape Cod "40 percent less fat" chips. We pack the newspaper, our Kindles, towels, chairs and umbrella, and drive to Herring Cove. It used to be gays to the left, straights to the right. Now the straights are in the gay area.
TIME FOR A DIP We set up and run into the ocean. It's a mystery why we both love the ocean so much. We've decided the beach and ocean are the only places we don't fight. We hug and swim and talk. The water is like glass. Then we have lunch. People who bump into us say hi and eat our Cape Cod chips.
PLEASURE READ Then I read. There's something about novels on the beach. It's all pleasure. I just finished "Daisy Jones & the Six" and have started "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo." Elysa just finished the Carole King biography. I eventually fall asleep with my mouth open and snore. By 5-ish we're packing up.
FOCUS ON JOKES Back home it's work mode. It's hard to communicate with me because I'm focused on what I'm doing that night on stage. There's a palpable shift. I sit with my notebook at the kitchen table and go through jokes, usually new ones I've written during the week and want to include. Then I shower, dress, get my face on and get my bag ready.
HEAD SPACE I ride my red Trek bike and enjoy the 10 minutes of solitary time to get into the right head. You would think getting on stage is no big deal, but I still have anxiety.
SECOND HOME The Post Office is a second home. Phyllis Schlossberg, who owned it, gave a lot of performers their start. I come minutes before a show starts because I don't like waiting around to go on. I sit at the bar and get a water; I don't drink before a set because I want every synapse of my brain working. If I have a new bit, I can't wait to get to it. The show is about what annoys me, like cancel culture, antisemitism, stupidity and turning 60.
TWO SCOOPS Elysa has come to the show, and since I can't eat a big meal before performing, and most restaurants are closed after 9:30 p.m. on a Sunday, we stop and get ice cream. I'm a traditionalist: two scoops -- one coffee with chocolate chunks, and the other is just chocolate, with chocolate sprinkles -- and a sugar cone. Elysa is very experimental with her food. She likes to try weird combos, like ginger molasses.
RIDE BACK After a show we bike home on Commercial Street, two old lesbians with their bells going off because everyone is in the middle of the street. At home we watch TV. We just watched the Mary Tyler Moore documentary, which I loved, and Netflix's "Eldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate," about queer Berlin in the '30s. I always say I'm going to stay up, then I fall asleep. Elysa looks at me to see if I'm asleep, and eventually says, "Judy, I'm going upstairs, let's go." Then I can't move. I stay on the couch, and get up at 1:30 or 2 a.m. and go upstairs and I'm out.

An Unlikely Landing Pad For Prestige Media Alumni: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When Graydon Carter started his digital newsletter, Air Mail, in 2019, the initial advertisers included Hermès, Ralph Lauren and Standard Industries.
The first two names on that list made perfect sense, given the worlds of Hollywood, celebrity and international society that Mr. Carter covered exhaustively while he was editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years -- a mix he has since transported to Air Mail.
The third was a head scratcher. Standard Industries? It sounded like a shadowy multinational corporation in a James Bond film.
By 2021, Standard was not only an advertiser in Air Mail but also an investor in the publication. That year, while speaking to a reporter from Business Insider, Mr. Carter shed some light on his publication's new benefactor. He described Standard as "a very glamorous roofing company."
Over the past few years, Standard, described on its website as a "global industrial company," has become a backer of several media start-ups in addition to Air Mail.
They include Pushkin Industries, the podcasting network co-founded by Malcolm Gladwell; Cabana, a lushly produced twice-yearly shelter magazine and e-commerce site; Spiegel & Grau, a book publisher established by two veteran Random House publishers; and Puck, a digital publication that covers wealth and power and has a profit-sharing arrangement with its writers.
A roofing business investing in buzzy media start-ups seemed curious, to say the least. But surprisingly, the connections between Standard and the media world -- and the lost kingdom of Vanity Fair under Mr. Carter in particular -- don't end there.
Several former Vanity Fair employees -- what Mr. Carter, in an email, called the VF diaspora -- have gone to work for Standard. They include Beth Kseniak, the magazine's longtime communications director; Sara Switzer, a publicist; and Dan Gilmore, an articles editor and a former assistant to Mr. Carter.
Jon Kelly, a founder of Puck and another of Mr. Carter's former assistants, even compared Standard to his former employer.
"The vibe of the office feels like Vanity Fair," Mr. Kelly told The New Yorker last year when interviewed about his new media venture. "People are sharp and sophisticated. It's just classy."
How did a roofing company come to be a player in the media business and the next career step for high-achieving magazine veterans?
The answer, it seems, is as much about the aspirations and evolution of Standard as it is about the extinction of the type of career once offered by legacy print media.
More Than a Roofer
Standard Industries' headquarters are in Midtown Manhattan, and the company is far more than a roofer. Its website says it operates in more than 80 countries and has about 20,000 employees. In 2021, Forbes ranked it the 46th largest private company in the United States.
The business dates to the early 1980s, when Samuel Heyman, a corporate raider, bought GAF Corporation, a manufacturer of roofing materials in New Jersey, and took the company private. GAF later became mired in asbestos-related lawsuits. When Mr. Heyman died unexpectedly in 2009, his sons-in-law, David Millstone and David Winter, who at the time were both 32 and already working for their father-in-law, took over the roofing company.
That same year "the Davids," as they are referred to internally, founded Standard Industries as a holding company to build upon GAF and Winter Properties, a real estate company in New York started by Benjamin Winter Sr., Mr. Winter's great-grandfather. The men have added subsidiaries, acquiring W.R. Grace, a chemicals company that has faced its own asbestos lawsuits; Braas Monier, a European roofing manufacturer; and Icopal, a Danish maker of high-end roofing products.
Mr. Millstone and Mr. Winter declined to comment for this article, through a spokesman. (The company also declined to speak on the record but provided background information to The Times.) According to several former employees and associates of Standard, the Davids have aspirations to shake up the humdrum business of roofing and to become technology-focused innovators and disrupters.
Mr. Millstone studied philosophy at Yale, where he rowed crew, and attended Harvard Law School. He is said to be a big fiction reader interested in issues of sustainability and social justice. He and his wife, Jennifer, live in Aspen, Colo., and are philanthropists for public service and Jewish causes.
Mr. Winter grew up in Rye, N.Y., and studied economics and political science at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the one who is most interested in media, associates say. Mr. Winter is divorced from Mr. Heyman's daughter, Liz, and lives in Manhattan. He is on the boards of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Carnegie Hall and Conservation International.
In a rare interview, Mr. Winter told Forbes in 2021 that he and Mr. Millstone aimed to "crack rooftop solar" and unseat Elon Musk and Tesla as the new kings of the green technology. Standard recently introduced solar roofing shingles that it said need only a nail gun to install. Another project involves making roofing materials that incorporate 5G technology.
While doing things that felt familiar to the core business, the Davids were also expanding Standard Investments, an investment arm they established, which now manages more than $ 4 billion. The majority of that money is invested in the public markets, in other industrial companies like Shell. But through Standard Investments, the Davids have also invested in businesses further afield, like MyForest Foods, which makes plant-based meat alternatives; Saildrone, which operates ocean drones for mapping and data; and the electric carmaker Rivian.
Given Standard's early involvement in Air Mail and its many links to Vanity Fair, one might assume that Mr. Carter, 74, is the person who wooed the Davids to invest in his new media venture and then others.
But in an email from Italy, where he was on vacation with his family, Mr. Carter dispelled that idea. Asked if he made introductions to Mr. Kelly and others who received funding from Standard, or put in a good word for former employees who have gone to work there, Mr. Carter said, "Not at all."
He said the person responsible for that was Hamilton South, a veteran public relations executive who has worked at Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren and later helped found (and eventually sold) HL Group, a communications and consulting agency with fashion and corporate clients.
"Hamilton was on the front lines in this," Mr. Carter said. "He brought in Beth Kseniak to handle communications and, before you know it, the place was filled with the VF diaspora."
Stylish and well connected, Mr. South, 59, is also a Vanity Fair alum. He was hired at the magazine in 1989 under the editor Tina Brown, and became one of the few staff members from that incarnation to earn Mr. Carter's admiration and to stay on when he took over in 1992.
An Enticing Pitch
Mr. South came to Standard as chief of staff in September 2017; the company had previously been a client at HL Group. He has since become Standard's vice chairman.
He counts Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller as close friends. He and his husband, Manuel Bellod Álvarez de Lorenzana, a retired investment banker, own multiple homes in the United States and Spain.
Several people echoed Mr. Carter's account that it was Mr. South who acted as a consigliere to the Davids, helping to remake Standard's corporate culture. That makeover was achieved, in large part, by importing the staff and culture that Mr. Carter had built at Vanity Fair, starting soon after he ended his reign as editor in late 2017 and was replaced by Radhika Jones.
In 2018, as part of companywide cost cutting at Condé Nast, which owns Vanity Fair, about 20 of its staff members were let go. Among them were longtime members of Mr. Carter's inner circle, including Ms. Kseniak along with a deputy editor, Dana Brown. The mass firing, which happened on Feb. 14, has become known in Vanity Fair circles as "the St. Valentine's Day Massacre."
Many who lost their jobs had benefited from the largess of Condé Nast -- and, to some extent, Mr. Carter -- and were staring down uncertain professional lives after years on the mountaintop. Enter Mr. South, who began contacting former staff members with an enticing pitch to work at a company on the rise and at a salary significantly higher than their media jobs.
Mr. Brown, who worked at Vanity Fair for more than two decades, starting as Mr. Carter's assistant in 1994, said that working there partly required you to be a polymath -- to have "specific knowledge" of different industries and social scenes and to know "how the world works." The job also involved being a living embodiment of the stylish world created by its top editors.
Now, according to Mr. South's pitch, Standard needed culturally astute storytellers and worldbuilders. People who could burnish the reputation of a company with a subsidiary, Siplast, that worked on the roofs of notable buildings like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Moynihan Train Hall.
Ms. Kseniak consulted initially and came aboard in late 2019. Already on staff was Harrison Vail, a member of her team at Vanity Fair whom Mr. South had contacted. Others, like Ms. Switzer and Mr. Gilmore, who is now chief of staff for Mr. Millstone, soon followed.
Mr. Vail is now back working for Mr. Carter as the communications director at Air Mail. Ms. Kseniak, Ms. Switzer, Mr. Gilmore and Mr. South, through a spokesman for Standard, declined to comment for this article.
Mr. Brown, 50, who chronicled his time at Vanity Fair in a memoir, "Dilettante," was initially surprised when he heard some former colleagues were working for an industrial firm, he said, but he understood the appeal. By then, the golden age of magazine publishing was over, killed by the internet and social media, and the famously lavish budgets and salaries were vanishing.
"I tell you, if I had gotten a call from Standard Industries, offering me a job with a great salary and benefits, I would have been, like, 'Screw it. I'm in the roofing business now,"' Mr. Brown said. (Some of his colleagues who left Vanity Fair did transition into jobs more similar to what they had been doing. Aimée Bell, a deputy editor, became a vice president at Gallery Books, a Simon & Schuster imprint. Krista Smith, the magazine's executive West Coast editor, went to work for Netflix.)
Another former Vanity Fair staff member who heard Mr. South's pitch was Lizzie Wolff, who also worked in communications with Ms. Kseniak and joined the digital newsletter theSkimm after Vanity Fair. Ms. Wolff, 40, said she was hesitant to make the switch from media.
"I worked at a place where we did the biggest party in the world," she said, referring to the annual Vanity Fair Oscar party. "You can imagine me at a cocktail party. 'Solar, investments, this and that."'
But after speaking to the Davids, she added, "I remember thinking these were really engaged and engaging guys. They were interested in transforming their business, but also had ideas and an interesting vision." As at Vanity Fair, Ms. Wolff worked with Ms. Kseniak at Standard. She left the company earlier this year to consult and raise her children.
In 2019, Standard started a webcast speaker series that treated employees in its trucking and roofing subsidiaries -- and anyone who wanted to watch online -- to events featuring "innovators and thought leaders" in conversation with Mr. Millstone and Mr. Winter. Participants included the author Jennifer Egan discussing curiosity and fiction and the TV host Seth Meyers musing on fatherhood. Two Vanity Fair alumni, Matt Ullian and Jane Sarkin, who now run an events company, Boldface Partners, were hired to wrangle some guests.
At the same time, Ms. Kseniak and her team of former Vanity Fair staff members sought interesting stories within Standard's many businesses to pitch to mainstream media outlets like Forbes to raise the company's profile.
The team also had to develop relationships with people from the roofing industry and trade publications, which sometimes made for fish-out-of-water moments.
In 2020, Mr. Vail found himself in Dallas to attend the International Roofing Expo. At Vanity Fair, he had also traveled for work -- to the South of France, for the Cannes Film Festival.
Building a Media Portfolio
As Mr. South helped remake Standard's corporate culture in the image of Vanity Fair's, he also leveraged his connections to bring the Davids opportunities to invest in media -- an industry that, though diminished, still had a certain pizazz and power associated with it. (Consider Jeff Bezos and other billionaires who have bought media companies -- or Mr. Carter, who left Vanity Fair only to return to media.)
Jacob Weisberg, the former editor of Slate and a founder of Pushkin, which produces such podcasts as "Broken Record" and "Revisionist History," said he has known Mr. South since his early days working in media. He said that relationship was ultimately how Pushkin's pitch deck ended up with the Davids in late 2018.
Mr. Kelly has known Mr. South since he was an assistant at Vanity Fair. Mr. South invited him to meet the Davids in May 2018 and, not long after, Mr. Kelly contacted Mr. South to see if Standard wanted to invest in the business that became Puck.
Julie Grau and Cindy Spiegel used to work with Mr. South's sister, Mary South, at Riverhead Books. In early 2021, the women pitched to Standard their idea for a "content-forward, format-agnostic" publisher that would take a boutique approach to releasing books, as well as create original podcasts and audiobooks.
"We spoke to David Millstone and he communicated very clearly that he believed in what we were doing and that he wanted to support it," Ms. Grau said.
As for Mr. Carter, he was having dinner with Mr. South in 2021 after completing the initial funding round for Air Mail. Mr. South "mentioned that if we went out for another round," Standard would be interested, Mr. Carter said in an email.
The media investments represent a tiny fraction of Standard's portfolio -- about $ 25 million of the investment arm. But they seem to hold a sizable interest for Mr. Millstone and Mr. Winter, who recently made another investment in Puck.
"He's not there for the wrong reasons," Mr. Weisberg said of Mr. Winter, who sits on Pushkin's board, and is a board observer at Puck. "He's there to learn and because it's interesting. He gets it. He's truly curious about how media works."
In 2020, Standard moved offices, into the space that Mr. Kelly likened to Vanity Fair's glamorous offices back in the golden days.
The company, which needed more space for staff, relocated from the 30th floor of the Solow Building on West 57th Street, where tenants include Chanel and Apollo Global Management, to the 46th and 47th floors.
The newly designed, open-plan office, which Standard declined to show to The Times in person, features light wood floors, artwork by Ed Ruscha and views of Midtown and Central Park.
"Quiet luxury, as they say these days," Mr. Carter said of Standard's headquarters.
Vanity Fair has also moved offices.
In another cost-cutting move, Condé Nast reduced its 1.2 million square feet of office space at One World Trade Center and subleased several floors. As a result, Vanity Fair relocated from a floor-through space on the building's 40th floor down to the 25th floor, where the staff is now squeezed together with the staffs of Vogue, GQ, Glamour, Self, Allure and other titles.

Philip L. Sherman, 67, a Maestro Of a Mohel for 45 Years, Is Dead: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A mohel who became a boldface name, he said his record in 45 years of performing the Jewish religious rite was 11 in a single day (including two pairs of twins).
Armed with only a scalpel, a clamp and a metal probe, Philip L. Sherman would routinely carry out his surgical mission in about 15 seconds, leave in as little as 10 minutes and hotfoot it to his car, which was probably parked illegally but perhaps spared a ticket by the inspired placard on his windshield: "Mazel Tov! Bris in progress. Please don't ticket."
Mr. Sherman, whose website (as well as his vanity license plate) was emoil.com, claimed to have performed some 26,000 ritual circumcisions, mostly in the New York metropolitan area, during his 45-year career. He was trained in the Jewish religious practice of brit milah -- a profession generally spelled "mohel" in English and pronounced "moil."
His record, he said, was 11 in a single day, including two pairs of twins -- a considerable scheduling feat, considering that the ritual is to be performed on the eighth day of the baby's life and during daylight.
Mr. Sherman also performed circumcisions on Muslim and Christian infant boys, as well as the son of a man he had circumcised as an infant and the grandsons of two Israeli prime ministers, and in all kinds of places, including Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands and a bar on Third Avenue (for a family who lived upstairs).
He died on Aug. 9 at his home in Englewood, N.J. He was 67. His daughter, Nina Sherman Green, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.
Mr. Sherman performed his first circumcision when he was 21, in Brooklyn during a blizzard (prudently, he had stayed over nearby the night before). After his cancer diagnosis, he began what he called a sabbatical in June.
Sporting his signature bow tie, Mr. Sherman did his best to leaven a ceremony that is not for the fainthearted. For Mr. Sherman, it was a living -- and, most important, it was the fulfillment of an enduring and sacred religious covenant, immortalized in the biblical verse "And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son."
"I'm there to fulfill a Torah commandment, to educate, let them know what the significance is, briefly, appropriately, tastefully," he told The New York Times in 2012.
He performed so many brises for Jewish families in New York that he became a boldface name and was written about like a celebrity.
His services did not come cheap. "You pay $ 800 for a steady hand and a good reputation," Scott Stringer, the former New York City comptroller, told The Times after his son, who was born in December 2011, was circumcised by Mr. Sherman. "It's not the kind of thing where you're looking to save money."
But Mr. Sherman said he did not turn away families who could not afford his fee.
Philip Lloyd Sherman was born on April 26, 1956, in Syracuse, N.Y. His mother, Malvina (Jacobs) Sherman, was an English teacher. His father, Paul Sherman, was a factory worker.
He was inspired to study brit milah by his grandfather Isadore Jacobs, who was a mohel and also a rabbi, a cantor, a dayan (a religious judge) and a shochet (a ritual slaughterer). After studying with Rabbi Yosef Hakohen Halperin, a renowned mohel, in Jerusalem, Mr. Sherman graduated in 1979 with degrees in music and Bible studies from a joint program run by Columbia University and the Jewish Theological Seminary.
He also served as a cantor at several synagogues in New York, including the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Manhattan from 1985 to 2019. He also occasionally worked as an actor.
He played a judge on the Netflix series "Orange Is the New Black" and appeared in an episode of the Amazon Prime show "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel." He was also cast in the 2011 Paul Rudd movie "Our Idiot Brother."
"I played a mohel, but the scene was cut," he told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. "How ironic."
He described himself as the only motorcycle-riding mohel in the Screen Actors Guild.
In the actual religious ceremonies over which Mr. Sherman presided, he not only starred; he also fed the supporting players their lines.
"Let me tell you my secret," he routinely confided to new fathers, according to an interview with The New Yorker in 1999. "After it's over, be sure to thank your wife for doing a great job and giving you such a perfect son."
In addition to his daughter, Mr. Sherman is survived by two sons, Reuven and Elan Sherman, from his marriage to Naomi Freistat, which ended in divorce; his brothers, Steven and Martin Sherman; and six grandchildren. His marriage in 1994 to Andrea Raab ended in divorce in 2022.
Mr. Sherman performed the brises for his sons and his grandsons, pointing out that in addition to following the biblical injunction to Abraham (rather than deferring to a doctor and turning a religious ceremony into a strictly medical procedure), he had undergone a full year of training.
Yes, he acknowledged, of course the baby feels pain during it. But, he added, "when it's done properly, only for a moment."
And, yes, he said, it was also true that sometimes even just by imagining the removal of the baby's foreskin, one of the parents or a guest might pass out. But, he suggested cheerfully, "usually at a bris, there's no shortage of doctors or lawyers."
When the actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg told him that she hated attending a bris, Mr. Sherman offered her a suggestion.
"The next time you go to one," he advised, "do what I do: Close your eyes."
Just kidding, he added.

Full text: A series of films about the annual CrossFit Games, enthusiastically embraced by the niche fitness community, have become surprise hits on streaming platforms.
The morning after he uploaded his new movie "Froning: The Fittest Man in History" to the iTunes store, in early October 2015, the director Heber Cannon received a phone call from somebody at iTunes, who sounded bewildered.
"Froning," a documentary about the four-time CrossFit Games champion Rich Froning Jr. that Cannon made as an employee of CrossFit Inc.'s media team, had shot overnight to the top of the U.S. iTunes sales chart for independent movies, and was sitting in third overall, directly below "Jurassic World" and the Melissa McCarthy comedy "Spy." According to Cannon, the iTunes rep wanted to know how a film they'd never heard of had wound up beside blockbusters.
"They called us and said, 'Who are you guys? How did you do this? What's going on?"' Cannon said in a recent video interview. "We didn't even have distribution. We had just done it ourselves. But when we dropped the film, it was like wildfire."
Cannon and his creative partner Marston Sawyers, who work together under the name Buttery Bros, followed up "Froning" with a string of documentaries about athletes performing at the CrossFit Games. Held annually since 2007, first at a remote ranch in Aromas, Calif., and now at the 10,000-seat Alliant Energy Center in Madison, Wis., the CrossFit Games test athletes in a wide range of skills including running, cycling, Olympic lifting and gymnastics, and are designed to determine the fittest man and fittest woman on the planet. The films, which include "Fittest on Earth" (2016), "Fittest on Earth: A Decade of Fitness" (2017) and "The Redeemed and the Dominant: Fittest on Earth," (2018), depict the Games in all their arduous, sweat-soaked agony, focusing on every explosive muscle-up and hefty snatch.
It's proven catnip for CrossFitters. The company's annual Games documentaries are consistent streaming hits, with no sign that demand is slowing down. "Resurgence," from 2021, sat at the top of the iTunes charts worldwide for three days in a row. The latest, "Fittest on Earth: Retro/Active," about the 2022 CrossFit Games season, came out on June 30, and remains one of the top documentaries on iTunes two months later.
Tyson Oldroyd, a member of the CrossFit media team and a coordinating producer on the documentaries, credited their success to a community that is "just so hungry" to see their sport in action. "We've had some wild and exciting success around the launch of our films over the years, and the audience continues to show up," he said in a recent interview. "The CrossFit community is and always has been ravenous for our content."
Nico Bade, an owner of the CrossFit affiliate Mamba Gym and the founder of the German national CrossFit league, the Fitness Bundesliga, likened a CrossFitter watching the documentaries to a basketball fan watching LeBron James in the N.B.A. "Everyone has his hero or his role model in the sport, and we want to see them perform, as well as see them behind the scenes," Bade said. "How are they warming up? What are they eating? Are they nervous before a competition?"
A familiarity with CrossFit isn't mandatory to enjoy these movies. But, Bade said, it does help to have done these kinds of exercises -- like handstand push-ups and jump rope double-unders -- to have a sense of what the competitors are going through. "You cannot really relate to how hard this if you don't already do the sport," he said.
Mariah Moore, who assumed directing duties on the CrossFit docs in 2021 after Cannon and Marston were laid off, said that the films are mostly for a built-in audience. "These films were made for CrossFitters by CrossFitters," she said in a recent interview. "Because we're part of the community, we know what the community wants to watch. We don't have to stop and explain what CrossFit is every time. The viewers know. It's a franchise at this point, like 'Fast and the Furious."'
Although some people do discover CrossFit through the documentaries and not the other way around -- particularly when some of the films began streaming on Netflix and were available to watch on Delta Air Lines flights, reaching broader audiences -- an audience of CrossFitters may be audience enough. Justin LoFranco, the founder of the CrossFit news blog Morning Chalk Up, pointed out that while CrossFit as it stands is "anything but mainstream," CrossFit athletes have shown a "tremendous buying power" as a community.
"CrossFit is not on the tip of everyone's tongue or the fitness trend du jour," he said, but added, "if 24 Hour Fitness were to release a documentary, where do you think that would sit on the charts?"

They Review Movies on TikTok, but Don’t Call Them Critics

Maddi Koch loves to spread the gospel about a good movie. Her favorites are little-noted thrillers with few stars but juicy concepts or dig-your-nails-into-the-sofa plot twists.
On TikTok, where Koch has 3 million followers (and goes by Maddi Moo), her review of “What Happened to Monday,” about a dystopian world where seven identical sisters share a single identity, has drawn more than 24 million views. “If I were to die tomorrow, I’d watch this tonight,” she raved.
Koch, who is a senior at Virginia Tech and is sometimes paid by film companies to promote their work, said she makes videos to connect people and to spare them “the pain of arguing over finding a movie or not knowing what you’re really looking for.” (Most of her videos, including the “What Happened to Monday” review, are not sponsored.) When asked, she’ll describe herself as a “random girl” who loves movies, a “content creator,” or, sure, even an “influencer.”
But one title that she would never use might be the most obvious: “Critic.”
“I just don’t see myself in that light,” she said.
Koch, 22, is among dozens of personalities on TikTok, along with peers like Straw Hat Goofy and Cinema.Joe, who reach millions of people by reviewing, analyzing or promoting movies. Several earn enough on the platform — from posts sponsored by Hollywood studios (many have taken a break from working with them since the actors’ strike), through one of TikTok’s revenue sharing programs or both — to make their passion for film a full-time job, a feat amid long-standing cuts to arts critic positions in newsrooms.
But the new school of film critic doesn’t see much of itself in the old one. And some tenets of the profession — such as rendering judgments or making claims that go beyond one’s personal taste — are now considered antiquated and objectionable.
“When you read a critic’s review, it almost sounds like a computer wrote it,” said Cameron Kozak, 21, who calls himself a “movie reviewer” and has 1.5 million followers. “But when you have someone on TikTok who you watch every day and you know their voice and what they like, there’s something personal that people can connect to.”
On MovieTok — as the community is known — the most successful users generally post at least once per day, with videos typically ranging between 30 and 90 seconds. Many attempt to capture the viewer’s attention within the first three seconds (“This movie’s perfect for you if you never want to sleep again,” begins Koch’s review of the hit horror film “Barbarian”) and speak directly to the camera, with screenshots from the film in the background.
Many creators, most in their 20s or early 30s, specialize within a particular niche. Joe Aragon (Cinema.Joe, 931,000 followers) is known for his breakdowns of coming attractions; Monse Gutierrez (cvnela, 1.4 million followers) and Bryan Lucious (stoney_tha_great, 387,000 followers) demystify and rank horror films; Seth Mullan-Feroze (sethsfilmreviews, 256,000 followers) leans toward art house and foreign cinema.
Unlike film departments at major metropolitan newspapers or national magazines, individuals on MovieTok generally don’t aspire to review every noteworthy film. And while most expressed admiration for traditional critics’ grasp of film history, they tended to associate the profession as a whole with false or unearned authority.
“A lot of us don’t trust critics,” said Lucious, 31. He was one of many who pointed to the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, where the scores of “Top Critics” often differ widely from those of casual users, as evidence that the critical establishment is out of touch. “They watch movies and are just looking for something to critique,” he said. “Fans watch movies looking for entertainment.”
MovieTok creators are not the first in the history of film criticism to rebel against their elders. In the 1950s, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and other writers of the journal Cahiers du Cinéma disavowed the nationalism of mainstream French criticism. In the 1960s and ’70s, New Yorker critic Pauline Kael assailed the moralism associated with Bosley Crowther, a longtime movie critic of The New York Times, and others. And movie bloggers in the 2000s charged print critics with indifference or hostility to superhero and fantasy films.
“There’s always this denigrating of those so-called ‘other’ critics as somehow elitist and old-fashioned while presenting yourself as the new avant-garde,” said Mattias Frey, head of the department of media, culture and creative industries at the City University of London and the author of “The Permanent Crisis of Film Criticism.” He defined criticism, by any name, as “evaluation grounded in reason,” citing philosopher Noël Carroll.
Juju Green, a 31-year-old former advertising copywriter, sees himself as on a “mission to combat film snobbery." Known as Straw Hat Goofy, Green is the most prominent member of MovieTok, with 3.4 million followers and an emerging side career as a correspondent and host. His most popular video, in which he identifies Easter eggs in Pixar movies, has nearly 29 million views.
Seven years ago, Green started a movie-themed channel on YouTube — which favors longer, more produced videos — but abandoned it after the birth of his first child. On TikTok, he found that he could reach an enormous audience with relatively little effort. He said one of his first videos on the platform, a post from January 2020 about Tom Holland’s performance in “Avengers: Endgame,” received more than 200,000 views in about an hour.
“I had a feeling like I was meant to do this,” he said. Green quit his advertising job last year.
Without the salary of a news organization, MovieTok creators earn money by partnering with entertainment companies. A sponsored post promoting a film or streaming service can be worth anywhere from $1,000 to $30,000.
Green’s clients have included Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros., among others. In January, Universal paid him to create a post at an NFL game promoting the movie “M3GAN” that received nearly 7 million views — part of a marketing campaign that helped the film earn $30.2 million in the United States and Canada on opening weekend, about 30% more than box office analysts had predicted.
It is impossible, of course, to make a direct link between TikTok influencers and ticket sales. But there are signs that the impact can be considerable. Sony executives have cited MovieTok campaigns as one reason for the strong performance of “Insidious: The Red Door,” which cost $16 million to make and has taken in a surprising $183 million worldwide.
Being paid by the studios presents an obvious conflict of interest. Creators may be reluctant to speak negatively about the products of a company that pays them (or might). While traditional news organizations, including the Times, sell ads to movie studios, they do not allow critics, reporters or editors to accept compensation from them and generally keep editorial and business operations separate.
Carrie Rickey, who was the film critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer from 1986 to 2011, said she refrained from working too closely with studios to avoid even the “appearance of impropriety.”
“It would mar my reputation as an independent writer,” she said.
Many on MovieTok have evolved an ad hoc code of ethics — accepting payment only for trailer announcements or general recommendations, for example, rather than true reviews — but recognize accusations of bias as an occupational hazard.
“I always try to be super transparent with my viewers,” said Megan Cruz (jstoobs, 535,000 followers), noting that she is careful to identify gifts and sponsorships in her videos. “We do exist in this in-between space, and I think it’s important to clarify whenever you’re getting any kind of advantage.” (By law, paid endorsements on TikTok must be labeled, but gifts, including swag boxes and travel to red carpet events, are not always disclosed.)
Cruz, 34, echoed other MovieTok reviewers who said they dislike doing sharply negative posts and would be unlikely to slam a movie whether they were in business with the studio or not. She said she generally prefers to deliver negative opinions in the form of a “compliment sandwich,” preceded and followed by more positive remarks.
“It pains me to say that this movie, by and large, did not work for me,” she said, in a review of the horror-comedy “Renfield.” Cruz then added, “There are a lot of individual elements of this film that really do work.”
Another source of income is TikTok itself. Since 2020, the platform has shared revenue with accounts that meet eligibility requirements. Gutierrez said that between sponsored posts and payouts from TikTok, she has made as much as four times the salary of her previous job as a substitute teacher.
After Hollywood actors went on strike in July, many creators stopped working for the studios in solidarity. SAG-AFTRA, the actors union, issued guidelines for influencers last month discouraging them from accepting “any new work for promotion of struck companies or their content.”
Green, who had previously implied that he would continue working as usual, subsequently walked back those comments. He said in a recent interview that he had turned down eight proposals to work with struck companies and would continue to do so for the duration of the strike.
“It was a mistake that I made, and I completely own that,” he said.
The lack of Hollywood work has prompted many creators to pivot to other subjects, such as independent films and anime.
But with or without the studios, those interviewed for this story said their obsession with dissecting movies would remain.
“I like to call it professional overthinking,” Green said.

Clarence Avant, Mighty Engine Behind Black Superstars, Dies at 92: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Behind the scenes, he furthered the careers of numerous entertainers, as well as some athletes and politicians.
Clarence Avant, a record executive who shaped the careers not only of Bill Withers, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and other Black singers, but also of politicians, actors and sports figures -- exerting so much influence that a 2019 documentary about him was called simply "The Black Godfather" -- died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 92.
His family announced his death in a statement.
Mr. Avant (pronounced AY-vant), born in a segregated hospital in North Carolina and educated only through the ninth grade, moved easily in the high-powered world of entertainment, helping to establish the idea that Black culture and consumers were forces to be reckoned with.
He started out managing a nightclub in Newark in the late 1950s and moved on to representing some of the artists he met there. Joe Glaser, a high-powered agent who handled Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and many other top acts, took Mr. Avant under his wing; perhaps, the documentary suggested, Mr. Glaser, who was white, thought it would be advantageous to have a Black man representing some of his Black clients.
In any case, Mr. Avant was soon handling artists including the jazz organist Jimmy Smith and traveling in rarefied circles. Not all his clients were Black; he said Mr. Glaser sent him to Los Angeles in 1964 with the Argentine pianist Lalo Schifrin, who was then working with Dizzy Gillespie, to try to get Mr. Schifrin started on a career composing for film and television. Though he knew nothing about the movie business, Mr. Avant worked his brand of magic on the West Coast: Mr. Schifrin has to date been nominated for six Oscars.
In 1969 Mr. Avant formed Sussex Records -- he said the name was his combination of the two things people want more than anything else, success and sex -- which lasted only about half a decade but released, among other records, Mr. Withers's early albums.
"Clarence made some great choices musically," Mr. Withers, who died in 2020, said in the documentary. "'Lean on Me"' -- Mr. Withers's only Billboard No. 1 hit -- "was not my choice for a single."
Later in the 1970s Mr. Avant founded Tabu Records, and for a time in the 1990s he was chairman of Motown. He also helped Jim Brown, the football player, build an acting career and negotiated an endorsement deal for Hank Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player, as well as supporting the political careers of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
"One of the things he understands is, there are different kinds of power," Mr. Obama said in the documentary. "There's the power that needs the spotlight, but there's also the power that comes from being behind the scenes."
In 2013, accepting the entrepreneur award at the BET Honors, one of many he received in his career, Mr. Avant summed himself up.
"I can't make speeches," he told the crowd while clutching his trophy. "That's not my life. I make deals."
Clarence Alexander Avant was born on Feb. 25, 1931, in Greensboro, N.C., to Gertrude Avant Woods, a domestic worker. In the documentary, he said his mother was not married to his father, Phoenix Jarrell, whom he barely knew.
He grew up in Climax, N.C., in difficult circumstances and stayed in school only through ninth grade.
"We were poor," he said in the film. "I'm talking about poor, poor, poor. We had chicken-feet soup."
Racism was omnipresent, and the Ku Klux Klan loomed large.
"My mother would just tell us, if you hear a car coming, run and hide; lay down flat," he said.
He grew up with a stepfather, Eddie Woods, who was abusive, and he said he left home when he was a teenager after his attempt to kill the man by putting rat poison in his food failed. He went to live with an aunt in Summit, N.J.
For a time he held a low-level job at Martindale-Hubbell, publisher of a law directory. In his 20s he started working at a Newark nightclub that featured Black musicians. That was his introduction to the entertainment business, and he proved a natural.
"I think Clarence exemplifies a certain cool," Mr. Obama said in the documentary, "a certain level of street smarts and savvy that allowed him to move into worlds that nobody had prepared him for and say, 'I can figure this out."'
As his career representing entertainers began to flourish, Mr. Avant met Jacqueline Gray, a model. They married in 1967, and as the couple prospered Ms. Avant became noted for her philanthropic work.
In December 2021 a man burglarizing the Avants' home, Aariel Maynor, shot and killed her. He pleaded guilty to multiple charges the next year and was sentenced to life in prison.
In the documentary, friends remarked on their long marriage, somewhat unusual in the entertainment world.
"They still look like they've got wedding cake on their feet," the actor Jamie Foxx said, "like they just walked off a soul wedding cake."
Mr. Avant's daughter, Nicole Avant, said in a phone interview that after the tragedy, her father made a conscious effort to press on.
"Music was, I think, the lifesaving force for him," she said, especially that of Ellington, Frank Sinatra and other artists from his youth. "His mood changed when the music came on."
At about the time he was getting ready to marry Jacqueline, Mr. Avant was growing more vocal about racial matters. A 1967 article in The Pittsburgh Courier quoted a strongly worded letter he had written to the management of WLIB, a radio station in New York that was aimed at a Black audience but at the time was white-owned.
"Is your station managed by Negroes," he wrote, "and I am not referring to Negro disc jockeys?"
"I think radio stations whose programs are supposed to appeal to the so-called Negro market," he added, "should at least be staffed by Negro personnel."
He was also becoming active politically. He supported the early campaigns of Andrew Young, who made an unsuccessful run for a Georgia congressional seat in 1970 and a successful one two years later. It was Mr. Young who connected Mr. Avant to Hank Aaron when he was about to break Babe Ruth's career home run record in 1974.
"Clarence called me up and said, 'Andy, do you know Hank Aaron?"' Mr. Young recalled in the documentary, which was directed by Reginald Hudlin. "I said, 'Yeah, he lives around the corner.' He said, 'If he's about to break Babe Ruth's record, he's supposed to make some money."'
Mr. Avant wanted to help Mr. Aaron secure some endorsement deals.
"Will you tell him that I'm not crazy and I'm going to call him?" Mr. Avant asked Mr. Young.
"I said, 'Well, I can't vouch for you not being crazy,"' Mr. Young said, "'but I'll tell him that you've been very helpful to me."'
It was fraught territory -- Mr. Aaron was receiving death threats over the prospect that he would break a hallowed record set by a white player. Mr. Avant, though, according to the documentary, marched into the office of the president of Coca-Cola and told him, in unprintably blunt language, that Black people drink Coke.
Mr. Avant's guidance helped Mr. Aaron secure a substantial deal from Coke and otherwise market himself, which fueled his later charitable endeavors.
"Henry Aaron would not be Henry Aaron if it were not for Clarence Avant," Mr. Aaron, who died in 2021, said in the film.

Mr. Avant also helped other athletes, including Jim Brown as he transitioned from football into acting in the 1960s. Interviewed for the documentary, Mr. Brown, one of the biggest Black stars of the 1960s and '70s, had a hard time pinning down what Mr. Avant did -- not an uncommon thing among those who knew and worked with Mr. Avant.
"You have this guy called Clarence Avant that everybody's talking about, but nobody seems to understand just what his official title was," Mr. Brown, who died in May, said, recalling their early meetings. "I couldn't tell you now exactly what he -- was he an agent, a manager, a lawyer? -- what he was."
Mr. Avant had rocky times in the mid-1970s, when the Sussex label went bankrupt and KAGB-FM, a radio station he had bought (making it one of the first Black-owned stations in the Los Angeles area), floundered. But, he said, friends were always his most important asset, and some of them helped him get back on his feet.
Tabu Records, which Mr. Avant founded in 1975, released records by the S.O.S. Band, Cherrelle and others.
In addition to his daughter, who was a producer of "The Black Godfather," Mr. Avant is survived by a son, Alexander, and a sister, Anne Woods.
The Avant home was always abuzz with A-list visitors. Nicole Avant recalled a day, when she was 12, that she and a friend got into trouble at school. The friend's mother, driving Nicole home, was fuming -- until she saw Harry Belafonte walking out of the Avants' house.
"Is that Harry Belafonte?" the woman asked her.
"I said, 'Yeah, how do you know Harry Belafonte?" -- not realizing he was anyone other than a friend who would come around to visit her parents from time to time.
Ms. Avant, who served as ambassador to the Bahamas during the Obama administration, said that Mr. Belafonte and others who would gather at the Avant home were serious about breaking down racial barriers, in the entertainment world and in society in general.
"They knew that they were on a mission," she said.
The flood of tributes offered to Mr. Avant on Monday included many from younger performers who appreciated his legacy.
"He is the ultimate example of what change looks like, what architecting change looks like, and what the success of change looks like," the rapper and producer Pharrell said in a statement. "He stared adversity in the face in climates and conditions that weren't welcoming to people that looked like him. But through his talent and relentless spirit in the pursuit to be the best of the best, he garnered the support and friendship of people who otherwise wouldn't look in our direction."

'Barbie' Brings Delight, and Anger, to Saudi Arabia: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Denounced in some Middle Eastern countries for undermining traditional gender norms, the hit movie is finding an audience in Saudi Arabia, illustrating the region's shifting political landscape.
On Friday night, Mohammed al-Sayed donned a pale pink shirt and denim overalls to join a friend at a movie theater in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, where the men settled in to watch a film about a doll on a mission to dismantle the patriarchy.
Similar scenes played out across the conservative Islamic kingdom last weekend, as women painted their nails pink, tied pink bows in their hair and draped pink floor-length abayas over their shoulders for the regional debut of the movie, "Barbie." While critics across the Middle East have called for the film to be banned for undermining traditional gender norms, many Saudis ignored them.
They watched as the movie imagined a matriarchal society of Barbie dolls where men are eye candy. They laughed when a male character asked, "I'm a man with no power; does that make me a woman?" They snapped their fingers in delight as a mother delivered a monologue about the strictures of stereotypical femininity. Then, they emerged from the darkened theaters to contemplate what it all meant.
"The message is that you are enough -- whatever you are," said Mr. al-Sayed, 21, echoing the Ken doll's revelation.
"We saw ourselves," said Mr. al-Sayed's friend, Nawaf al-Dossary, 20, wearing a matching pink shirt.
Watching Barbie's search for identity and meaning, Mr. al-Sayed said he was reminded of the fraught period when he started college and wasn't sure of his place in the world. He said he believed that the movie had important lessons for men as well as women.
"I felt like my mom should see the film," he said.
"All of our families -- all families," Mr. al-Dossary said, laughing.
That this was happening in Saudi Arabia -- one of the most male-dominated countries in the world -- was mind-boggling to many in the Middle East. When "Barbie" opened on Thursday in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, it arrived suddenly and overwhelmingly. Moviegoers rushed to prepare Barbie-pink outfits. Some theaters scheduled more than 15 showings a day.
A snide headline in the Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat declared that Saudi cinemas had become "havens for Gulf citizens escaping from harsh restrictions" -- a twist in a country whose people once had to drive to Bahrain to watch movies.
Eight years ago, there were no movie theaters in the Saudi kingdom, let alone any showing films about patriarchy. Women were barred from driving. The religious police roamed the streets, enforcing gender segregation and shouting at women to cover up from head to toe in black.
Since he rose to power, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 37, has done away with many of those restrictions while simultaneously increasing political repression, imprisoning conservative religious clerics, leftist activists, critical businessmen and members of his own family.
Even now, despite sweeping social changes, Saudi Arabia remains a state built around patriarchy. By law, the kingdom's ruler must be a male member of the royal family, and while several women have ascended to high-ranking positions, all of Prince Mohammed's cabinet members and closest advisers are men. Saudi women may be pouring into the work force and traveling to outer space, but they still need approval from a male guardian to marry. And gay and transgender Saudis face deep-seated discrimination, and sometimes arrest.
So as word spread through the kingdom that "Barbie" would debut on a delayed schedule -- a sign that government censors were most likely deliberating over it -- many Saudis thought the movie would be banned, or at least heavily censored. Bolstering their expectations was the fact that neighboring Kuwait banned the film last week.
Lebanon's culture minister, Muhammad Al-Murtada, also called for the film to be banned, saying that it violated local values by "promoting homosexuality" and "raising doubts about the necessity of marriage and building a family." It is unclear if the government will follow his recommendation.
Even in Arab nations that have allowed the film to be shown, it has faced intense criticism. The Bahraini preacher Hassan al-Husseini shared a video with one million Instagram followers calling the movie a Trojan horse for "corrupt agendas."
And in Saudi Arabia, not everyone is receptive to the film. To the entrepreneur Wafa Alrushaid, who suggested that the film be banned in her country, its messages are a "distortion of feminism."
"I'm a liberal person who has called for freedom for 30 years, so this isn't about customs and traditions, but the values of humanity and reason," she told The New York Times. The film, she argued, excessively victimizes women and vilifies men, and she objected to the fact that a transgender actress had played one of the Barbies.
"This film is a conspiracy against families and the world's children," Ms. Alrushaid, 48, declared.
Many Arab critics of the movie expressed views similar to those of some American politicians and right-wing figures who have castigated the film as anti-male. The tussle in the Middle East over the movie illustrates how battles that sometimes echo the so-called U.S. culture wars are playing out on a different landscape.
The animated film "Lightyear," which showed two female characters kissing, was banned in several countries in the region last year. And six Gulf Arab countries issued an unusual statement last year demanding that Netflix remove content that violates "Islamic and societal values and principles," threatening to take legal action.
In Kuwait, religious conservatives have become more vocal in recent years, Gulf analysts say, broadcasting views that many Saudis would be hesitant to express in public now, fearing repercussions from the government.
"Banning the movie 'Barbie' fits into a larger tilt to the right that's increasingly felt in Kuwait," said Bader Al-Saif, an assistant professor of history at Kuwait University. "Islamist and conservative forces in Kuwait are relishing in these culture wars to prove their ascendancy."
Some Kuwaitis expressed astonishment that they would have to travel to the Saudi kingdom to watch the movie. Many pointed out the irony that Kuwait and Lebanon, despite objecting to the film, had long provided greater freedom of expression than many other Arab countries.
Streaming out of movie theaters in Riyadh, people who watched "Barbie" seemed to leave with their own understanding.
Yara Mohammed, 26, said that she had enjoyed the movie, dismissing the Kuwaiti ban as "drama."
"Even if kids saw it, it's so normal," she said.
To Abrar Saad, 28, the message was simply that "the world doesn't work without Ken or Barbie; they need to complete each other."
But to teenage girls like Aljohara and Ghada -- who were accompanied by an adult and asked to be identified only by their first names because of their ages -- the film felt deeper.
"The idea was pretty realistic," said Aljohara, 14, wearing a hot pink shirt underneath her black abaya. She said she liked that the film ended with a type of equality between men and women.
"But it wasn't nice that it ended with equality," interjected Ghada, 16. "Because I feel like equality is a little bit wrong; I feel like it's better for there to be equity because there are things a boy can't do but you can do them."
Asked if they ever thought they would watch such a movie in Saudi Arabia, both exclaimed, with laughter: "No!"
"I was expecting them to censor a lot of scenes," Ghada said.
In fact, it did not appear censors had cut anything major. A scene in which Barbie declares that she has no vagina and Ken no penis remained, as well as a scene with the transgender actress. The Arabic subtitles were rendered faithfully -- including the word patriarchy.

Clarence Avant, Mighty Engine Behind Black Superstars, Dies at 92: [Correction]

Full text: Behind the scenes, he furthered the careers of numerous entertainers, as well as some athletes and politicians.
Clarence Avant, a record executive who shaped the careers not only of Bill Withers, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and other Black singers, but also of politicians, actors and sports figures -- exerting so much influence that a 2019 documentary about him was called simply "The Black Godfather" -- died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 92.
His family announced his death in a statement.
Mr. Avant (pronounced AY-vant), born in a segregated hospital in North Carolina and educated only through the ninth grade, moved easily in the high-powered world of entertainment, helping to establish the idea that Black culture and consumers were forces to be reckoned with.
He started out managing a nightclub in Newark in the late 1950s and moved on to representing some of the artists he met there. Joe Glaser, a high-powered agent who handled Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and many other top acts, took Mr. Avant under his wing; perhaps, the documentary suggested, Mr. Glaser, who was white, thought it would be advantageous to have a Black man representing some of his Black clients.
In any case, Mr. Avant was soon handling artists including the jazz organist Jimmy Smith and traveling in rarefied circles. Not all his clients were Black; he said Mr. Glaser sent him to Los Angeles in 1964 with the Argentine pianist Lalo Schifrin, who was then working with Dizzy Gillespie, to try to get Mr. Schifrin started on a career composing for film and television. Though he knew nothing about the movie business, Mr. Avant worked his brand of magic on the West Coast: Mr. Schifrin has to date been nominated for six Oscars.
In 1969 Mr. Avant formed Sussex Records -- he said the name was his combination of the two things people want more than anything else, success and sex -- which lasted only about half a decade but released, among other records, Mr. Withers's early albums.
"Clarence made some great choices musically," Mr. Withers, who died in 2020, said in the documentary. "'Lean on Me"' -- Mr. Withers's only Billboard No. 1 hit -- "was not my choice for a single."
Later in the 1970s Mr. Avant founded Tabu Records, and for a time in the 1990s he was chairman of Motown. He also helped Jim Brown, the football player, build an acting career and negotiated an endorsement deal for Hank Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player, as well as supporting the political careers of Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
"One of the things he understands is, there are different kinds of power," Mr. Obama said in the documentary. "There's the power that needs the spotlight, but there's also the power that comes from being behind the scenes."
In 2013, accepting the entrepreneur award at the BET Honors, one of many he received in his career, Mr. Avant summed himself up.
"I can't make speeches," he told the crowd while clutching his trophy. "That's not my life. I make deals."
Clarence Alexander Avant was born on Feb. 25, 1931, in Greensboro, N.C., to Gertrude Avant Woods, a domestic worker. In the documentary, he said his mother was not married to his father, Phoenix Jarrell, whom he barely knew.
He grew up in Climax, N.C., in difficult circumstances and stayed in school only through ninth grade.
"We were poor," he said in the film. "I'm talking about poor, poor, poor. We had chicken-feet soup."
Racism was omnipresent, and the Ku Klux Klan loomed large.
"My mother would just tell us, if you hear a car coming, run and hide; lay down flat," he said.
He grew up with a stepfather, Eddie Woods, who was abusive, and he said he left home when he was a teenager after his attempt to kill the man by putting rat poison in his food failed. He went to live with an aunt in Summit, N.J.
For a time he held a low-level job at Martindale-Hubbell, publisher of a law directory. In his 20s he started working at a Newark nightclub that featured Black musicians. That was his introduction to the entertainment business, and he proved a natural.
"I think Clarence exemplifies a certain cool," Mr. Obama said in the documentary, "a certain level of street smarts and savvy that allowed him to move into worlds that nobody had prepared him for and say, 'I can figure this out."'
As his career representing entertainers began to flourish, Mr. Avant met Jacqueline Gray, a model. They married in 1967, and as the couple prospered Ms. Avant became noted for her philanthropic work.
In December 2021 a man burglarizing the Avants' home, Aariel Maynor, shot and killed her. He pleaded guilty to multiple charges the next year and was sentenced to life in prison.
In the documentary, friends remarked on their long marriage, somewhat unusual in the entertainment world.

Mr. Avant wanted to help Mr. Aaron secure some endorsement deals.
"Will you tell him that I'm not crazy and I'm going to call him?" Mr. Avant asked Mr. Young.
"I said, 'Well, I can't vouch for you not being crazy,"' Mr. Young said, "'but I'll tell him that you've been very helpful to me."'
It was fraught territory -- Mr. Aaron was receiving death threats over the prospect that he would break a hallowed record set by a white player.

Full text: The filmmakers didn't want to disappoint fans of Casey McQuiston's novel about the romance between a U.S. president's son and a British prince.
On most Fridays, the Victoria & Albert Museum in London closes at 10 p.m. sharp. But one night last summer, after all of the tourists had spilled back onto the streets of South Kensington, two men slow-danced among the Berninis and Rodins until the sun rose the next morning. A cover of "Can't Help Falling in Love" by the indie-pop singer Perfume Genius echoed through the sculpture hall, soundtracking their tender moment.
The nocturnal scene was a scripted one from "Red, White & Royal Blue," the film adaptation of the 2019 novel by Casey McQuiston. The two men under the dimmed lights were the actors Taylor Zakhar Perez and Nicholas Galitzine, and they swayed until the director, Matthew López, called "Cut!" around 2 a.m. for a lunch break.
"It was just the three of us and our crew," said López, who's also the film's co-writer. "It made for an incredibly intimate, really special night."
The romantic comedy follows Alex Claremont-Diaz, the bisexual son of the first female U.S. president (played by Uma Thurman, with a thick Southern drawl), and Prince Henry, the younger brother of the heir to the British throne who has known since birth that he's "gay as a maypole." What starts as a simmering rivalry between the impulsive American (Zakhar Perez) and the buttoned-up Brit (Galitzine) soon develops into a clandestine relationship. Neither is publicly out, and their secret love complicates things, especially for Henry.
Amazon Studios and Berlanti Productions secured the film rights to McQuiston's novel at auction ahead of its May 2019 release, and the book has since spent more than 20 weeks as a New York Times best seller.
But best-seller lists don't fully convey the adoration that "Red, White & Royal Blue" has garnered on BookTok -- the literature-loving corner of TikTok -- where fans have shared their obsession with the escapist love story en masse, and videos tagged #redwhiteandroyalblue have received more than 500 million views.
Jacob Demlow, who frequently posts about "Red, White & Royal Blue" on his "A Very Queer Book Club" account, said he flung his copy across the room in delight when he first encountered it.
"I couldn't believe what I was reading. It was all these amazing tropes that romance lovers have loved forever, but there was a couple in it who looked like a couple I would be in," said Demlow, who estimated that he'd read the novel at least a dozen times. "I grew up watching movies about the girl falling in love with the prince, but I'd never seen that through a queer lens before. It was kind of earth-shattering in ways I still don't fully know if I can comprehend."
The film, premiering on Prime Video on Friday, hopes to recreate that excitement onscreen, and represents the directorial debut of López, a Tony-winning playwright known for penning "The Inheritance," as well as writing (with Amber Ruffin) the musical adaptation "Some Like It Hot." López was working on those projects in 2020 when his agent first floated the idea of turning "Red, White & Royal Blue" into a stage musical.
"I read it and said, 'Yeah, sure, maybe. But let's talk about the movie,"' López recalled. "I knew I wanted to be the person who made this film by, like, Page 50."
After pleading his case to the producers Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter, López signed on to direct and did a second pass on an original script by Ted Malawer. He cast two lead actors who had cut their teeth on Netflix romances: Zakhar Perez, 31, who starred as Marco in "The Kissing Booth" sequels; and Galitzine, 28, who appeared in the streamer's military romance "Purple Hearts." Galitzine also played the prince in Amazon's Camila Cabello-led "Cinderella."
For both Zakhar Perez and the director, the character Alex's biracial identity was particularly meaningful. López grew up in Panama City, Fla., with his Puerto Rican father and Polish Russian mother, while Zakhar Perez is of Mexican, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean descent and was raised in northwest Indiana, where he said there was only one other Mexican family.
"Matthew and I talked a lot about the mestizo journey," Zakhar Perez said in a video call before SAG-AFTRA, the actor's union, went on strike. "Being part Mexican, part lots of other things, I don't want to say you're forgotten, but in today's world, it's like, you're either this or you're that. There's nothing in between. I'm kind of a cultural chameleon."
"As a young Latiné queer man, I never read something that centered someone like Alex," López said, echoing his star. "If I had been presented with this character when I was in my late teens, early 20s, it may have changed how I thought about myself."
During the audition process, Zakhar Perez and Galitzine did their chemistry reads via video and did not meet in person until rehearsals began in London. But the nature of the script meant they would need to quickly become comfortable shooting a variety of passionate scenes, which were overseen by the intimacy coordinator Robbie Taylor Hunt.
"Nick and I trusted each other quite quickly," Zakhar Perez said of Galitzine. "We had to build a sexual tension from dislike to like to love, and we wanted to show that journey through the choreographed, intimate moments."
In the book, McQuiston described Alex and Henry's amorous bedroom -- and tack room and hotel room -- scenes in great detail, and López said he "never, ever shied away from the sexuality" onscreen.
"At times, it's extremely hungry and at times, it's really tender," Galitzine said in a separate prestrike call. "Matthew was always adamant that he wanted to portray gay sex in an accurate way, which he felt maybe hadn't been the case in other L.G.B.T.Q.+ movies."
While the only lingering sex scene is a carefully cropped, emotional moment, and the only nudity is the flash of a naked buttocks, "Red, White & Royal Blue" received an R rating from the Motion Picture Association.
López was surprised: "If we had put six bullets into the prince, we probably would have still gotten PG-13," he said, and added, "If it had been a man and a woman, I question whether or not it would have gotten an R rating."
(The filmmaker Ira Sachs recently expressed similar confusion over the NC-17 rating for his new film "Passages," which also features gay sex. The M.P.A. said in a statement to The Associated Press, "The sexual orientation of a character or characters is not considered as part of the rating process.")
In the weeks leading up to the movie's release, anticipation continued to build among fans, coupled with fears that it might not capture the magic of the book. Some worried about the casting choices, the elimination of several supporting characters or the switch from a fictional queen of England to a fictional king, played in a single scene by Stephen Fry.
"I was never going to entirely fulfill the image of this book that the millions of people who love it individually have in their heads," López said. "I knew from the beginning," he also emphasized, "that this movie would succeed or fail based in part on the fans' belief that one of them has made this film. I am one of them."
Broader critiques take issue with the premise of the story itself and the fact that it's yet another queer romance that involves the distress of coming out. But Demlow of A Very Queer Book Club sees it differently.
"There are so many coming-out stories that need to be heard, and we also need more stories that aren't coming-out stories," he said. "It's not that we need less of something. It's that we need more of everything."

Full text: Laura Rubin, a journaling coach, believes there's a group that is in desperate need of her services: corporate America.
On a clear blue Friday in July, a group of 20 people from different professional backgrounds -- a sports coach, a television executive, an owner of a public relations company -- sat around a table stocked with nuts and fruit in Montauk, N.Y., to learn how to journal.
With a glass of white wine in hand and against the backdrop of a harbor, the instructor, Laura Rubin, led a discussion about the group's preconceptions of the practice.
"The last time I journaled was in 1988 on a trip to Tibet," one man said. "My mom said you will never remember this stuff unless you write it down."
"A lot of people only journal when they travel," Ms. Rubin replied. "But don't you want to enjoy and savor your whole life?"
"I haven't touched a journal since I was a kid because my mom always read them," another participant added.
"That is not uncommon," Ms. Rubin responded, calling this a typical "journaling trauma." The reasons continued: It was a practice for only teenage girls; it was something helpful only in a crisis; it was too scary to find out what would emerge on the page.
"I'm going to change all of your minds, and of course I have a method of teaching that I have tried and tested, but that is not why," she said. "It's because journaling works. It gets you where you need to go."
'I am not a yoga teacher from Topanga'
Ms. Rubin, 50, who lives in Sag Harbor, founded a company named Allswell Creative in 2015 that facilitates workshops around the world to teach people how to journal. Her main objective is to reach people who wouldn't naturally gravitate toward journaling -- in environments "that aren't associated with fuzzy slippers and bath balms" -- especially those working in corporate America or other high-pressure environments (she has worked with wounded veterans, for example).For most of her life, Ms. Rubin worked in corporate America or as an entrepreneur. She ran a marketing communications agency on both coasts that represented mega-fashion companies and large, bureaucratic foundations. "Because I come from a corporate background I understand the unique environment they are operating in," she said. "I am not a yoga teacher from Topanga."
She has also journaled for most of her life. "It helped me pivot from big jobs, not marry that guy, move coasts," she said. "It has been my North Star since I was 8."
So she knew the benefits of journaling were too good to reserve for wellness-minded folks. In fact, they might be more important for busy people.
"Journaling provides that opportunity to ask yourself the right questions and do check-ins. How does this make me feel? Is this the best use of my time?" she said.
Some studies show journaling or writing therapy can help reduce anxiety, stress and depressive feelings and even help heal injuries faster.
Ms. Rubin has put on workshops for companies like Netflix and soon, Nasdaq. Some workplaces even hire her to help employees manage their mental health.
"Especially in our industry, in entertainment, people work 12-hour work days and have really stressful clients," said Nikki Seidlin, a human resources director for Endeavor that held workshops for employees in its Los Angeles and New York City offices.
"Stressed and anxious employees are the top presenting issues we run into, so we want to give people a tool," she said, that allows them to "get their emotions out on the page instead of having them come out in unproductive ways."
Ms. Seidlin added that the workshops were voluntary and they had agents, executives, executive assistants and mail-room staff participate.
Other companies have specific goals. "There is a digital marketing agency I did a workshop for, and they were all so burnt out, because they work on their phones and look at a screen all day long," Ms. Rubin said. "The woman who hired me wanted her employees to have something to help counter the burnout."
A private foundation hired Ms. Rubin to run a workshop months after the death of George Floyd, giving employees, she said, "a place to privately express themselves in the midst of what could be a confronting process during which a lot of emotions were likely to emerge."
'The microdosing method of journaling'
The workshop in Montauk was sponsored by Whalebone, a surfing brand that publishes a magazine and sells merchandise, for the community. "I really want this to be a moment where we can all slow down together," said Eddie Berrang, Whalebone's president and publisher.
During the two-hour event, Ms. Rubin guided participants through different journaling exercises.
For four minutes the group wrote about everything they saw, heard or noticed. Other portions of the workshop were spent brainstorming ideas for slowing down or jotting down lists of things participants like.
When time was up, Ms. Rubin asked: "Did you feel any shift in terms of your presence?" Many nodded.
She added that they could do it for a few minutes every day at home. "It's like the microdosing method of journaling."

For Disney, Declines in Streaming and TV Are a One-Two Punch: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company experienced a sharp decline in its traditional TV business for the second straight quarter and will raise subscription prices for its streaming services.
Robert A. Iger's urgent need to overhaul Disney -- to turn its streaming division into a profitable enterprise and pull back on its troubled traditional television business -- came into sharp relief on Wednesday.
Disney's streaming operation lost $ 512 million in the most-recent quarter, the company said, bringing total streaming losses since 2019, when Disney+ was introduced, to more than $ 11 billion. Disney+ lost roughly 11.7 million subscribers worldwide in the three months that ended July 1, for a new total of 146.1 million.
All the decline came from a low-priced version of Disney+ in India. Last year, Disney lost a bid to renew the expensive rights to Indian Premier League cricket matches. Excluding India, Disney+ gained 800,000 subscribers, primarily overseas.
To make streaming profitable, Mr. Iger, Disney's chief executive, has shifted the focus at Disney+ away from brisk subscriber growth, which requires expensive marketing campaigns. Instead, Disney has been trying to make more money from the Disney+ subscribers it already has. The monthly price for access to an ad-free version of Disney+ rose to $ 11 in December, from $ 8.
Another hefty price increase is on the way. Starting on Oct. 12, the ad-free version will cost $ 14, Disney said. Hulu, which is also controlled by Disney, will begin charging $ 18 for ad-free access, up from $ 15. As an incentive, Disney will begin selling a new streaming package -- ad-free access to both Disney+ and Hulu -- for $ 20 a month starting on Sept. 6.
The ad-supported options for both Disney+ and Hulu will remain the same, at $ 8. "We're obviously trying with our pricing strategy to migrate more subs to the advertiser-supported tier," Mr. Iger told analysts on a conference call. The pricing news, along with a vow by Mr. Iger to follow Netflix by cracking down on password sharing, sent Disney shares up roughly 2 percent in after-hours trading.
Disney still relies on old-line channels like ESPN and ABC for roughly a third of its operating profits -- and those outlets are being maimed by cord cutting, sports programming costs and advertiser pullback. Disney's traditional channels had $ 1.9 billion in quarterly operating income, down 23 percent from a year earlier. Disney cited lower ad sales at ABC, partly because of viewership declines, and lower payments from ESPN subscribers, along with higher sports programming costs. (On a positive note, ESPN ad sales increased 10 percent.)
It was the second consecutive quarter in which Disney's traditional TV business recorded a sharp decline in operating income.
Disney is now exploring a once-unthinkable sale of a stake in ESPN. Not all of it, Mr. Iger has made clear. But he wants "strategic partners that could either help us with distribution or content," he said during an interview with CNBC last month. Disney has held talks with the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball about taking a minority stake.
Earlier this summer, Mr. Iger brought in two former senior Disney executives, Kevin Mayer and Thomas O. Staggs, to consult on ESPN strategy with James Pitaro, the channel's president, and help put together any deal. Mr. Mayer and Mr. Staggs were both viewed as possible successors to Mr. Iger when they were at Disney, ultimately leaving when they were passed over to start their own media company, Candle Media, with the private equity firm Blackstone as the backer.
Their return has sent the Hollywood and Wall Street gossip mills into overdrive. Are Mr. Mayer and Mr. Staggs now back in the running for Disney's top job? Is Blackstone a potential investor in ESPN? Maybe the whole company is being prepped for a sale -- with Apple as the buyer?
The first two questions did not come up on Disney's conference call, and Mr. Iger batted away the third. "I just am not going to speculate about the potential for Disney to be acquired by any company, whether it's a technology company or not," he said. "Obviously, anyone who wants to speculate about these things would have to immediately consider the global regulatory environment. I'll say no more than that."
ESPN on Tuesday announced a 10-year deal with a casino company to create an online sports betting brand and push more aggressively into the lucrative world of online gambling. Notably, the $ 2 billion deal allows ESPN to rake in gambling money without -- in keeping with Disney's family-friendly brand -- becoming a sports book itself.
Mr. Iger is also contending with dual strikes in Hollywood. Unionized screenwriters have now been on strike for 100 days and actors for 27. They want higher pay from streaming services and guardrails around the use of artificial intelligence by studios.
On the conference call, Mr. Iger addressed the strikes for the first time since mid-July, when he told CNBC -- from an elite gathering of chief executives in Idaho -- that union leaders were not being "realistic," prompting an eruption of vitriol on picket lines. On Thursday, reading from a script, Mr. Iger said it was his "fervent hope that we quickly find solutions to the issues that have kept us apart these past few months."
"I am personally committed to working to achieve this result," he added, saying that he had "deep respect and appreciation" for actors and writers.
Disney's quarter included some encouraging signs. The $ 512 million streaming loss was 32 percent less than analysts had predicted, for instance. In the fall, quarterly streaming losses reached $ 1.5 billion. In other words, Mr. Iger's effort to drastically reduce losses is working. "In spite of a challenging environment in the near term, I'm overwhelmingly bullish about Disney's future," Mr. Iger said, noting that the company was on track to exceed a goal, announced in February, to cut $ 5.5 billion in costs.
An 11 percent increase in profitability at Disney's theme park division -- despite weakness at Walt Disney World in Florida -- allowed the company to salvage the quarter, to a degree. Companywide revenue totaled $ 22.3 billion, a 4 percent increase from a year earlier; analysts had expected slightly more. About $ 2.7 billion in one-time restructuring charges resulted in net loss of $ 460 million, compared with $ 1.4 billion in profit a year earlier.
Excluding the charges, which were related to the removal of more than 30 underperforming shows and movies from Disney+ and Hulu, Disney reported earnings per share of $ 1.03. Analysts had expected 95 cents.
Growth at Disney's theme park division came largely from overseas. A year ago, the Shanghai Disney Resort was closed because of the Chinese government's Covid-19 restrictions. The Shanghai property was open for all of the most-recent quarter. Hong Kong Disneyland also reported improved results. Disney's five-ship cruise line has also been running at near capacity.
Economists have long watched Disney's domestic theme parks as informal barometers of consumer confidence. Historically, when budgets get tight, families cut back on expensive trips to Disney World. Whether for that reason or another, attendance at the Florida mega-resort declined. Attendance rose at Disneyland, in California.
Other theme park operators in Florida have seen similar attendance declines. Some analysts have blamed ticket price increases. Others have said that tourist demand has shifted away from locations that reopened earlier in the pandemic -- like Florida -- and toward destinations that remained closed for a longer period.

Puzzling Out When Rates Will Decline: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It's pricey to borrow to buy a business, car or home these days. Interest rates are expected to fall in coming years -- how much is up for debate.
Dr. Alice Mills was thinking of selling her veterinary practice in Lexington, Ky., this year, but she decided to put the move off because she worried that it would be difficult to sell in an era of rising interest rates.
"In a year, I think that there's going to be less anxiety about the interest rates, and I'm hoping that they're going to go down," Dr. Mills, 69, said. "I have to put my faith in the fact that the practice will sell."
Dr. Mills is one of many Americans anxiously wondering what comes next for borrowing costs -- and the answer is hard to guess.
It is expensive to take out a loan to buy a business or a car in 2023. Or a house: Mortgage rates are around 7 percent, up sharply from 2.7 percent at the end of 2020. That is the result of the Federal Reserve's campaign to cool the economy.
The central bank has lifted its policy interest rate to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent -- the highest level in 22 years -- which has trickled out to increase borrowing costs across the economy. The goal is to deter demand and force sellers to stop raising prices so much, slowing inflation.
But nearly a year and a half into the effort, the Fed is at or near the end of its rate increases. Officials have projected just one more in 2023, by a quarter of a point, and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, John C. Williams, said in an interview that he didn't see a need for more than that.
"We're pretty close to what a peak rate would be, and the question will really be -- once we have a good understanding of that -- how long will we need to keep policy in a restrictive stance, and what does that mean?" Mr. Williams said on Aug. 2.
The economy is approaching a pivot point, one that has many consumers wondering when rates will come back down, how quickly and how much.
"Eventually monetary policy will need over the next few years to get back to a more normal -- whatever that normal is -- a more normal setting of policy," Mr. Williams said.
So far, the jury is out on what normal means. Fed officials do expect to cut interest rates next year, but only slightly -- they think it could be several years before rates return to a level between 2 and 3 percent, like their peak in the years before the pandemic. Officials do not forecast a return to near zero, like the setting that allowed mortgage rates to sink so low in 2020.
That's a sign of optimism: Rock-bottom rates are seen as necessary only when the economy is in bad shape and needs to be resuscitated.
In fact, some economists outside the Fed think that borrowing costs might remain higher than they were in the 2010s. The reason is that what has long been known as the neutral rate -- the point at which the economy is not being stimulated or depressed -- may have risen. That means today's economy may be capable of chugging along with a higher interest rate than it could previously handle.
A few big changes could have caused such a shift by increasing the demand for borrowed money, which props up borrowing costs. Among them, the government has piled on more debt in recent years, businesses are shifting toward more domestic manufacturing -- potentially increasing demand for factories and other infrastructure -- and climate change is spurring a need for green investments.
Whether that proves to be the case will have big implications for American companies, consumers, aspirational homeowners and policymakers alike.
Kristin Forbes, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it was important not to be too precise about guessing the neutral rate -- it moves around and is hard to recognize in real time. But she thinks it might be higher than it was in the 2010s. The economy back then had gone through a very weak economic recovery from the Great Recession and struggled to regain its vigor.
"Now, the economy has learned to function with higher interest rates," Ms. Forbes said. "It gives me hope that we're coming back to a more normal equilibrium."
Many economists think slightly higher rates would be a good thing. Before the pandemic, years of steadily declining demand for borrowed money depressed rates, so the Fed had to cut them to rock bottom every time there was an economic crisis to try to encourage people to spend more.
Even near-zero rates couldn't always do the trick: Growth recovered only slowly after the 2008 recession despite the Fed's extraordinary efforts to coax it back.
If demand for money is slightly higher on a regular basis, that will make it easier to goose the economy in times of trouble. If the Fed cuts rates, it will pull more home buyers, entrepreneurs and car purchasers off the sidelines. That would lower the risk of economic stagnation.
To be sure, few if any prominent economists expect rates to stay at higher levels like those that prevailed in the 1980s and 1990s. Those who expect rates to stay elevated think the Fed's main policy rate could hover around 4 percent, while those who expect them to be lower see something more in the range of 2 to 3 percent, said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
That is because some of the factors that have pushed rates down in recent years persist -- and could intensify.
"Several of the explanations for the decline in long-term interest rates before the pandemic are still with us," explained Lukasz Rachel, an economist at University College London, citing things like an aging population and low birthrates.
When fewer people need houses and products, there is less demand for money to borrow to construct buildings and factories, and interest rates naturally fall.
Such factors are enough for Mr. Williams, the New York Fed president, to expect neutral rates to stick close to their prepandemic level. He also pointed to the shift toward internet services: Streaming a movie on Netflix does not require as much continuing investment as keeping video stores open and stocked.
"We are moving more and more to an economy that doesn't need factories and lots of capital investment to produce a lot of output," Mr. Williams said, later adding that "I think the neutral rate is probably just as low as it was."
That has some big implications for monetary policy. When inflation of around 3 percent is stripped out, the Fed's policy rate sits at about 2.25 to 2.5 percent in what economists call "real" terms. That is well above the setting of 1 percent or less that Mr. Williams sees as necessary to start weighing on the economy.
If price increases continue to fall, the Fed will inadvertently be clamping down on the economy harder in that "real" sense if it holds its policy interest rate steady, Mr. Williams said. That means officials will need to cut rates to avoid overdoing it, he said -- perhaps even as soon as early next year.
"I think it will depend on the data, and depend on what's happening with inflation," Mr. Williams said when asked if the Fed might lower interest rates in the first half of 2024. "If inflation is coming down, it will be natural to bring" the federal funds rate "down next year, consistent with that, to keep the stance of monetary policy appropriate."
For Dr. Mills, the Kentucky veterinarian, that could be good news, bringing partial retirement that much closer.
"I would love to get back into zoo work," she said, explaining that she had worked with big cats early in her career and would love to do so again once she sold her practice -- which is itself cats only. "That's something for retirement."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nikola Swann played a key role at S&P when the agency became the first to strip America of its top ranking in 2011.
When Nikola Swann heard that Fitch Ratings had removed the United States from its list of risk-free borrowers this week, he felt a sense of satisfaction.
"It was vindicating," he says.
More than a decade ago, Swann played a key role in a similar decision: He was Standard & Poor's primary analyst for its sovereign credit rating on the United States when the agency became the first ever to downgrade the nation's long-term credit rating amid a debt ceiling standoff in 2011.
At the time, the move was controversial, in part because the Treasury Department pointed out that S&P had overstated the federal debt by about $ 2 trillion. Bloomberg called the reasons for the downgrade "fundamentally political" in 2011, while others argued that it appropriately reflected a worsening debt crisis.
Both a decade ago and this week, partisan politics were cited as one reason for the downgrade. S&P cited "the gulf between the political parties." Fitch, which made the call two months after the United States narrowly avoided defaulting on its debt, cited "the repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions."
DealBook asked Swann over email about what had changed since S&P's downgrade, and what had not. The interview has been edited and condensed.
What did you make of the timing? Would it have been better to cut the U.S. credit rating during the debt ceiling debate?
The recurring debt-ceiling brinkmanship highlights the structural weaknesses in U.S. fiscal governance -- so the more acrimonious they are and the closer they come to the cash-flow precipice. The credit rating agency's job is to analyze all relevant information, with the two aforementioned variables among the more important indicators of the seriousness with which Washington treats U.S. federal payment obligations. It is natural to update your assessment soon after the latest debt-ceiling data point.
Does it make sense to downgrade the United States if you don't downgrade all the other AAA rated countries? After all, if the United States sneezes, so do all these other countries, right?
Many countries that were rated AAA in 2011 have since been downgraded by one or more credit rating agencies; examples include the U.K., France and Canada. The U.S. remains the world's most influential economy, but the strength of a country's economy, while important, is only part of a sovereign rating assessment. Fundamentally, a sovereign credit rating is not an opinion on the country's economy, per se, but on the likelihood that holders of the government's debt will be paid on time, in full, and unconditionally.
A strong economy helps enormously, but dysfunctional fiscal governance can outweigh that strength. The remaining AAA countries have stronger track records than the U.S. when it comes to fiscal governance.
When you downgraded the United States in 2011, were you surprised the other ratings agencies didn't follow suit?
I expected the others to follow, eventually. It took longer than I expected, but it is happening.
S&P's model had a mathematical error, which the U.S. Treasury pointed out. Why didn't you change it?
S&P's unprecedented 2011 downgrade of its U.S. sovereign credit rating was no error. The weaknesses we then pointed to, compared to AAA countries, in terms of Washington's ability to build bipartisan consensus on key policy questions in a timely manner, especially regarding fiscal management, have only worsened since. The same is true of U.S. fiscal outcomes.
Do you see a day when the U.S. rating goes back up?
That will happen when the U.S. significantly shrinks its structural fiscal deficit, putting government debt on a multiyear downward trajectory in terms of G.D.P., and more generally develops a track record for credible, medium-term fiscal discipline underpinned by multiparty political consensus -- inasmuch as, by then, the U.S. economy remains strong and the U.S. dollar remains among the world's most important currencies. -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump was indicted -- again. The former president was charged in connection with trying to overturn the 2020 election, adding to a growing list of legal charges against him. Trump pleaded not guilty in a Washington court appearance on Thursday and remains the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination next year.
Disney's Robert Iger taps former lieutenants for advice. The C.E.O. of the media giant brought back two former executives once touted as potential successors: Kevin Mayer, the former head of M.&A., and Tom Staggs, the ex-financial chief, will advise Disney on what the company should do with its legacy TV businesses.
Tom Brady becomes the latest North American star to invest in the other football. The N.F.L. legend took a minority stake in Birmingham City, the English soccer team, joining the likes of the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds, Rob McElhenney and Michael B. Jordan, and the basketball player LeBron James to invest in the sport.
Lessons from C.E.O. Swift
Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is expected to soon pass $ 1 billion in revenue, a milestone that often signifies a company's transition from start-up to global competitor. Ms. Swift is undoubtedly, if not quite literally, the C.E.O. of that tour, in addition to a powerful enterprise that includes high streaming numbers and huge merchandise sales.
"She's the C.E.O. of one of the biggest direct-to-consumer brands on the planet," said Nathan Hubbard, the former C.E.O. of Ticketmaster and current chief of the music company Firebird. (By comparison, the direct-to-consumer brand Warby Parker reported about $ 600 million in revenue this year.)
Mr. Hubbard called Ms. Swift "Steve Jobs-ian" in her focus on detail and end-user customer experience. Here's what else she may have in common with corporate titans.
She has full control over her brand. Beyond writing, singing and performing her own songs, she has a sharp understanding of her customers, said Manisha Thakor, a financial wellness expert.
Thakor likened Ms. Swift to Home Depot's founders, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank. "They were walking the aisles of the stores, they were talking to customers," she said, indicating that Ms. Swift had responded to feedback in a similar way when she dropped a new version of the song "Snow on the Beach," after fans had complained that the song's guest artist, Lana Del Rey, wasn't featured enough.
The remake's title: "Snow on the Beach (featuring more Lana Del Rey)."
She understands the importance of employee recognition. Ms. Swift recently reportedly gifted "life changing" $ 100,000 bonuses to truck drivers who worked on her tour, which is about 10 times the norm. She's also included truck drivers' names in the credits of her Netflix documentary on the last tour.
"Recognition, like money, like power, is not evenly distributed," said Loran Nordgren, a management professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. "Most people in any company know it only fleetingly and are hungry for it."
Her leadership style may also come with risks. Ms. Swift has created such a powerful brand for herself that she risks being called inauthentic if her actions stray from that mirage. One example of the pitfall: the backlash that Salesforce's Marc Benioff received when he laid off employees after espousing the company's familial "Ohana" culture.
There's also potential for overexposure, a challenge Ms. Thakor said was exemplified by Jack Welch. "We all hung on every single word during his G.E. years," she said. But when he left, and created concepts like the Jack Welch Management Institute, "we got fatigued by them, like we just didn't want to hear from him anymore," Ms. Thakor said.
We will definitely be hearing from Ms. Swift, at least until 2024. She announced new concert dates this week.
How an unexpected blockbuster hacked the box office
"Barbenheimer" isn't the only surprise hit at the box office: One of the biggest movies of the summer is a small-budget thriller about anti-child trafficking heroics that has been praised by both mainstream conservatives and the far-right.
"Sound of Freedom" has grossed more than $ 155 million domestically, beating rivals with much bigger budgets, like "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One." Controversy about the film's content, which critics say appeals to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory about a global cabal of pedophiles, very likely helped stir interest. But a novel promotion system has also played a role.
The movie's distributor, Angel Studios, took "word of mouth" marketing to a new level. It deployed a system called Pay It Forward to help bolster awareness. Here's how it works: At the end of the movie, audiences are urged by its star, Jim Caviezel, to tell others to see the movie to spread its message.
They're also shown a QR code that leads to a website where audiences can buy additional tickets for strangers -- and, the hope goes, continue the cycle.
Angel has used Pay It Forward before, including for the hit Jesus-focused streaming series "The Chosen." The distributor first tested the model for theatrical releases this year with the overtly religious movie, "His Only Son," which grossed $ 12.2 million worldwide.
But the system hit new levels of success with "Sound of Freedom," according to Brandon Purdie, Angel's head of theatrical distribution. (He declined to specify how many tickets were sold via Pay It Forward, saying only that it was "significant.")
The success of Pay It Forward came into doubt after reports on social media claimed that there were empty seats in supposedly sold-out showings of "Sound of Freedom." But Pay It Forward doesn't buy tickets before someone has claimed them. Instead, someone who wants to see the movie visits the Angel website and requests a coupon code that they can use when buying a ticket for a specific showing from a booking site like Fandango.
Brock Bagby, the executive vice president and chief content and development officer of B&B Theaters, which has 55 theaters, mostly in the Midwest, says the movie has drawn crowds.
He said that B&B audited its showings and couldn't find any instances of phantom tickets, and that it hadn't seen any drop in concession sales per ticket sold -- an important metric, given that cinemas collect more profit from selling popcorn and drinks than from seats alone. "There are actual humans in the seats," Mr. Bagby said.
It's unclear whether other movies can adopt this model. Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst, said that more studios could seek to adopt the marketing strategy, since it both gets the word out about a movie and can lead to more ticket sales.
But according to Mr. Bagby, such a system requires the right kind of movie and message: "Pay It Forward needs a message that people feel strongly about," he said.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Her Day Starts Well Before the Shows Do: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Rain or shine, Erika Elliott drives from borough to borough to check in on the performances happening in city parks as part of the annual music festival.
It is no surprise that Erika Elliott, the executive artistic director at SummerStage, celebrates New York through music.
"A favorite moment is looking out midperformance to see if the audience is enjoying something that started out as an idea," said Ms. Elliott, 49, who moved to New York from California in 1996 and joined SummerStage in 2004. "There's this cathartic, exciting and energetic feeling in an all-green public space when the audience and the artist and the stage all come together."
The music festival, run by the City Parks Foundation, started in 1986. This summer there are nearly 80 SummerStage shows in 13 parks across the city. The season, which started on June 3 with a performance by the band Hippo Campus in Central Park, ends Oct. 2 in Coney Island with the Yeshiva Boys Choir. In between are some standout superstars: Grandmaster Flash in Crotona Park; Tanya Tucker in Central Park; and Grand Wizzard Theodore and Monie Love, who are part of the festival's 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop celebration.
Ms. Elliott lives in Mott Haven in the Bronx with her boyfriend, Estarlin Trejo, 35, an aide at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; her son, Ethan, 15; two senior cats, Maestro and Sammy; and a goldendoodle, Ellie.
WAKE NATURALLY I don't use an alarm in the summer because I'm so tired. I try to wake up naturally at 9-ish a.m. I check email to see if there are fires to put out, and social media to check the response of what I posted from the shows the night before. Then I take Ellie, who is only 5 months, out for a quick walk. We're trying to get her house-trained.
PLANNING THE DAY By 11:30, the humans are up and I make eggs on Thomas' English Muffins. I'll have an English muffin with butter and Cheddar. I'm a Costco shopper, so it's bulk and not artisanal. I start thinking about what time talent is supposed to be on site, do I need to go to a sound check, what's the outline of the day and what's the weather forecast -- we are a rain or shine venue unless it's lightning.
NAILS OR CAFE CHAT I have three hours before I need to be at a venue. If I'm doing something for myself, I do a gel manicure and pedicure every two weeks at Romies Nails in Murray Hill. I debate in my head about a different color but always land on red. It's a classic. If not, Estarlin and I will get coffee at Chocobar Cortes. We both get iced coffees and croquetas de jamón Serrano, which is my favorite. We catch up with each other. It's an aspirational conversation about planning a hike at Pelham Bay Park or Minnewaska State Park Preserve.
PRE-SHOW Back home, I shower and dress -- jeans and a black shirt and these great Nike shoes called React Phantom, where you don't have to wear socks, you just slide them on. I have three pairs and I'm about to get another. It's a functional outfit; we're outdoors and in a park.
I drive to Yura, because they make good chicken sandwiches with a chive mayo, and Greek salads. Then I drive to a venue. I'm usually at Central Park first, because that's the hub for the festival and where we have a show almost every day. Plus, our production offices are there. I get there an hour before the show starts and check in with the production manager, look for my team and programming staff, and see if the artists are here and in their rooms. If they are, I say hello to them and their team. Then I sit in the production office and eat what I bought at Yura.
THE NIGHT BEGINS Doors open at 5 p.m. A D.J. or house music is playing through the sound system so guests always hear something when they walk in. Welcoming or opening remarks start at 5:50; the show starts at 6. I'm at stage right in the photo pit because it's private. I get into my own zone, watch the show and take video and photos to post on Instagram in real time. It's my way of documenting the show for myself, but also promoting it.
Usually we have three performers: an opener, a first act and a second one. I try to stay until the second act starts. I often hit two shows, sometimes three, each in different boroughs. I get into my car, which is parked behind the venue, and then it's off to the next location.
NEXT STOP I'm at the second venue by 8 p.m. I connect with the production or operations manager and see how things are going. I check in on talent and their team. I go up onto the stage and look at the performance from the rear to see the audience. Choosing an artist you believe in is not always easy; booking can be a difficult process. But when you see how many people are enjoying themselves at the show, it's validating. I take more photos and videos to document the experience and to share. I stay in the V.I.P. pit, which is where friends and co-workers are, until the show ends.
BACK IN THE CAR If I don't need to hang with the artists, I'll head home because I'm really tired. I'm in the car by 9:30ish. I might call a girlfriend because I have a captive 30 minutes to talk to someone. I'll call Ethan to see what he wants to eat as I stop for post-show food. Usually it's chicken and steak tacos from Taco Veloz VIP or pizza from Bronx Slice, both in my hood.
COUCH TIME Ethan and I sit on the couch and watch TV. Right now we're watching "Pennyworth," which is Batman's butler's prequel. I try to stay awake to see Estarlin, who comes home around midnight. I don't always make it -- I'm burnt. If I do, we'll watch something on Netflix. By 1:30 a.m. he stays up watching TV; I'm off to bed and I'm out.

Up From the Sewers in Search of Acceptance: [Review]

Full text: This time around, the four kung-fu-fighting old masters of the sewers dream of having a normal life with the humans. But not if Ice Cube can help it.
There's a refreshing sense of nostalgia in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem" -- and it doesn't just have to do with the fact that the eternally youthful ninja turtles have been around since the 1980s, in the form of the original comic book series, as well as TV adaptations, films, toys and video games.
It's in the very look of the movie: meticulous computer-generated animation remixed with lively doodles and scribbles, splotches of color and unclean lines -- the kind of art that would come from the combination of a free period, a pack of Sharpies and a composition notebook. After all, what's more adolescent than that?
You probably already know the back story: Four cute little turtles get transformed by radioactive ooze and are adopted and raised underground, in the sewers of New York, by a rat named Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan) who's a master of martial arts. They're all big fans of pizza.
Now, as teenagers, the turtles -- pugnacious Raphael (Brady Noon), doofy Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), nerdy Donatello (Micah Abbey) and their ever-earnest leader, Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) -- dream of having a normal life with humans. But the aboveground masses face their own threat: Another mutated creature, Superfly (Ice Cube), aims to overtake the human world, Magneto-style. The turtles team up with a student journalist named April (Ayo Edebiri) to try to save the day and hopefully be accepted into human society.
This is certainly a Ninja Turtles for the Internet Age -- which, like the web itself, is fun and vast, but ultimately tiring. The dialogue is stacked with pop culture references to show that the four kung-fu-fighting old masters of the sewers definitely have YouTube and Netflix (and, one assumes, surprisingly good Wi-Fi). So they reminisce about sneaking off to an Adele concert and catch Ferris Bueller at a Brooklyn movie drive-in, and Donatello waxes poetic about anime.
The movie shows the most heart when the group gets hyped up together, going into long, digressive riffs punctuated with jokes and dance moves, channeling the wholesome playfulness that has kept the franchise so popular.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Mutant Mayhem" pulls off its zany cartoon humor mainly in its fight scenes, where Jeff Rowe's direction, full of frenzied angles and high-flying action, perfectly replicates the chaos. There's a bit of body humor that, though not always as effective (with the noted exception of a vomiting scene, ironically paired with a chipper Natasha Bedingfield song), feels appropriate given its depiction of the roach-and-sewer experience that's New York living.
To top it off, "Mutant Mayhem" is sprinkled with self-referential jokes that poke fun at its own logic, like the inconsistent science behind the magical radioactive gunk. Even its villains troll the turtle-heroes, calling the green siblings "Geico geckos" and "Shreks."
With its far-reaching references, "Mutant Mayhem" is similar to the new wave of animated films, like "The Mitchells vs. the Machines" and the Spider-Verse films (and perhaps even going back a few years, with "Ralph Breaks the Internet" and the Lego movies), that revel in a pop culture pastiche of emojis, gifs, viral videos and chatspeak.
And the music is always on-point; Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross produce a killer score in their signature wild, industrial rock mixed with a few softer piano-heavy interludes. Other sequences jump off the screen thanks to the addition of quintessentially New York hip-hop, such as DMX and Blackstreet.
The casting is a thing of beauty, with more comedic talent than I have the space to call out here. Hearing Paul Rudd, Rose Byrne, Seth Rogen, John Cena, Hannibal Buress and Post Malone (as a reluctant bad guy who just wants to sing) as various colorful -- and I mean that literally and figuratively -- mutants is like, say, getting a free order of breadsticks with your pizza.
In fact, the cast of side characters almost outshines the turtles themselves in the comedy department, with Chan's endearing Splinter and Ice Cube's 1970s Blaxploitation-style funky-fresh villain, Superfly, being the prime examples.
But in the end, there's little complexity to the characters and no surprise to the plot. And even the messaging, about tolerance, good intentions and outsiders finding their brood, is so unimaginatively expressed that it feels cliché.
A film unintentionally stuck in its own kind of adolescence, "Mutant Mayhem" has plenty of charms but tries so hard to be cool, funny and relevant -- so totally online -- that it forgets to kick back with a slice, some buds and just, you know, vibe.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Studios Shift In Bid to Talk With Writers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The actors' union has historically been more willing to negotiate, but when Fran Drescher took a hard line as its leader, executives shifted their focus to the other striking guild.
When the Writers Guild of America told its members on Tuesday night that movie and television studios had asked for "a meeting this Friday to discuss negotiations," it was the first sign of movement in a stalemate that had begun in early May.
It also signaled a shift in strategy for Hollywood executives working behind the scenes to resolve dual union strikes that have ground the vast entertainment industry to a halt.
The 11,500 screenwriters represented by the Writers Guild went on strike in May after contract negotiations with the studios broke down. Last month, they were joined on the picket lines by tens of thousands of actors after their union, SAG-AFTRA, called a strike. Both unions are worried about not receiving a fair share of the spoils of a streaming-dominated future, among other issues.
Faced with navigating a two-front labor war, the studios at first remained focused on the actors. If that strike could be resolved relatively quickly, at least cameras could start rolling again on movies and shows that are past the writing stage, or so the thinking went. Crucially, actors would also be able to rejoin the publicity circuit for already-finished projects. (During a strike, SAG-AFTRA forbids promotional interviews, social media posts and red carpet appearances.)
The actors' guild has historically been more willing to negotiate with the studios, while the writers have taken a much harder line. Members of the Writers Guild have walked out several times through the decades, most recently in a 100-day strike that ended in 2008. The actors had last gone on strike in 1980.
Over the past week and a half, however, the companies reconsidered that thinking, according to three studio chairs, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the labor situation. The primary reason: Fran Drescher, the president of SAG-AFTRA.
Ms. Drescher, the former star and co-creator of the 1990s sitcom "The Nanny," has launched broadsides at studio executives, including Disney's chief, Robert A. Iger. Her sharp criticism of studios started at a news conference on July 13 and continued on picket lines over the next week. On Tuesday, she revved up the SAG-AFTRA membership anew, appearing at a New York City Council meeting and nearby rally. She called studio executives "greed-driven and disrespectful people."
SAG-AFTRA did not respond to a request for comment.
Studios decided there could be a path forward with the Writers Guild after a small, informal meeting at a home in Los Angeles last Wednesday, the studio chairs said. A handful of executives met with three members of the guild's negotiating committee, with senior showrunners helping to arrange the sit-down through back channels.
No negotiating took place, but the studio executives came away thinking that there could be a path to a deal, said a labor lawyer who was briefed on the meeting and discussed the private gathering on the condition of anonymity.
A spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, declined to comment. A representative for the Writers Guild also declined to comment.
A broader group of studio leaders convened on Zoom on Friday, the lawyer said. This session included Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, the chairs of Disney Entertainment; Donna Langley, the chair of the NBCUniversal Studio Group; Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-chief executive; and Tony Vinciquerra, the chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment.
There continued to be disagreement over how to handle certain Writers Guild demands, including staffing minimums in TV show writers' rooms. But some of the moguls -- notably Mr. Vinciquerra, the labor lawyer said -- pushed the group to move quickly to make a formal overture to the union.
Carol Lombardini, the lead negotiator for the studio alliance, called her counterpart at the Writers Guild on Tuesday. They agreed to meet in person on Friday to discuss a return to the bargaining table.
The three studio chiefs emphasized that discussions about how to resolve the standoff with SAG-AFTRA were also taking place. Pressure has been increasing from multiple directions -- agents, local elected officials, some of Hollywood's other unions -- to reach agreements with both the actors and the writers by Labor Day.
The writers and actors went on strike after they raised concerns about their compensation and working conditions now that streaming content is affecting all corners of entertainment. The writers' union has called its grievances "existential." In a video address to members last week, Chris Keyser, a chair of the Writers Guild negotiating committee, said writers of all stripes had, for some time, been "fighting for survival."
But in those same remarks, Mr. Keyser offered a self-described "olive branch" to the studios.
"If you are visionaries, envision a solution, not a stalemate," he said, addressing the studio chiefs. "Because this isn't a war we're in -- it's a negotiation. It's just a negotiation. And when you come to remember that again, we will be here as we have been here all along."
Mr. Keyser also said the writers remained unified.
"You cannot outlast us -- you cannot," he said. "And not just because we have the will. Because we have power. Nothing in this business happens until we start to write, and we will not start to write until we are paid."
When the writers first went on strike, the companies essentially turned away from them and focused on separate contract negotiations with the Directors Guild of America and the actors. Hammer out new agreements with them, or so the thinking went, and the Writers Guild, viewed as the most zealous of the three unions, would be boxed in, making its leaders more willing to bargain. It was a playbook that worked the last time the writers went on strike.
Studios reached an agreement with the directors' union in early June. So far, so good. But then came an unexpected plot twist: The actors' union angrily broke off talks in mid-July and joined writers on picket lines.
Since then, the clamor from actors has been relentless. On Wednesday, the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, a charity that is associated with the union but run separately, announced that Meryl Streep and George Clooney had helped raise $ 15 million for workaday actors in need of financial assistance. In a statement, Ms. Streep said, "We will stand strong together against these powerful corporations who are bent on taking the humanity, the human dignity, even the human out of our profession."
Jeffrey Ruthizer, who spent 40 years as a labor negotiator at Disney, ABC and NBC and recently wrote a book, "Labor Pains," described the stalemate as an "all-out war," adding that he had never "seen it this bad." He noted that leaders of the actors' union had asked members to authorize a strike before negotiations even began.
"That's highly unusual," Mr. Ruthizer said. "You don't stoke fear of a strike before sitting down. Once you inflame the passions, you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Paul Reubens committed to profound silliness without ever going mean or dark -- though some peers were disappointed that he focused on one character.
Of all the great flesh-and-blood cartoons of 1980s popular culture -- Hulk Hogan, Madonna, Mr. T -- the one easiest for small children to relate to was Pee-wee Herman. He made the same kind of obnoxious jokes we did ("I know you are but what am I?"), in a similar, if more overtly nasal, squeak while capturing an un-self-conscious exuberance that felt deeply familiar.
That's how it felt. In reality, Pee-wee Herman was nothing like us at all, a dreamy man-child in a red bow tie whose sugary smile could curl into a punky scowl. A singular piece of comic performance art for a mass audience, Pee-wee Herman stood out in every form he appeared in, from improv theaters to late-night talk shows to the movies to Saturday morning television.
That this character could be so easy to identify with and so singularly, slyly alien at the same time is the stupendous magic trick of his creator, Paul Reubens, a true original who died on Sunday at 70.
The first time I saw him do Pee-wee was on "Late Night With David Letterman," where he was one of the oddballs the show's executives would spotlight when they couldn't book real stars. Unlike Brother Theodore, Harvey Pekar or Andy Kaufman, Pee-wee introduced no hostility or even conflict to the show. His appearances on that most ironic of late-night shows were like invasions from Candy Land. He brought toys and disguises, and he would get up and dance even before the music played. There was a joy in his presentation that was bracing. You laughed not because the jokes were funny, but because they were told with such commitment to the fun of it all.
Letterman didn't know what to make of him. You did get the sense that the host enjoyed his guest's adolescent jerkiness. But there was more there. Even though Pee-wee was a broad character, something about him seemed more real than any conventional comic slinging punchlines or movie star selling a movie. This was a Bugs Bunny level of charisma, built to last.
Paul Reubens (born Paul Rubenfeld) started his career doing many characters for the sketch group the Groundlings, and he went on to embody even more extreme characters, including the monocled father of the Penguin in "Batman Returns" and an Austrian prince with an ivory hand in "30 Rock."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But once Pee-wee became a hit with crowds in the 1970s, he mostly abandoned his other roles, to the frustration of Phil Hartman, his improv peer and a future "Saturday Night Live" star, who thought he was wasting his talent focusing on just one part.
By the time he was starring in a Pee-wee movie directed by Tim Burton, Reubens was credited only as the writer. Pee-wee Herman played himself. This blurring of character and actor added a sense of mystery, and odd authenticity, to this stylized performance. A natural outsider, Pee-wee excelled at fish-out-of-water comedy. In "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" (1985) a classic comedy that is still Burton's best movie, Pee-wee finds himself winning over unlikely people in a quest narrative about his search for his bike.
He accidentally knocks over the motorcycles of a bunch of grizzled Hells Angels types, before charming them by jumping on the bar and dancing to the Champs' surf tune "Tequila." In another bit, he is talking in a telephone booth and trying to explain where he is, so he peeks his head out to sing, "The stars at night are big and bright." A team of cowboys responds in unison: "Deep in the heart of Texas!"
The world of Pee-wee is full of this loopy surrealism that could veer into innuendo but never got dark. It was always welcoming, wildly diverse, profoundly silly. The movie, along with his anarchic Saturday morning children's show, "Pee-wee's Playhouse," melded a child's energy with a love of show business. Reubens, who grew up in Sarasota, Fla., nearby the winter headquarters of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, managed to imbue such entertainment with the spirit of performance art, while never taking the easy route of going mean or dark. His work just got weirder.
Pee-wee's television stint ended in infamy when Reubens was arrested on a charge of indecent exposure in a porn theater. Late-night hosts pounced, and so did the news media. CBS took reruns of his show off the air. The controversy now seems preposterously overblown. That happened just one year before Sinead O'Connor's career suffered a blow from her protest on "Saturday Night Live" against sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church -- an episode that has come under new examination after her death last week. It's clear that dopey moralizing scandals are far from a hallmark of our age alone.
The one time I talked with Reubens, around seven years ago in an interview, he was, not surprisingly, quite different from his character: thoughtful, reserved, sober-voiced. He was modest about Pee-wee, who eventually returned.
No character that beloved, that meme-able, would not be pulled back to action in our current nostalgia-driven culture. There was a Pee-wee Herman Netflix movie and a Broadway show, and, while there were small updates here and there, the character remained in essence the same: giddy, exuberant, singularly strange and primally tapped into childhood.
Pee-wee got older but he never grew up. His career is an update on the Peter Pan story, except no one in Neverland would say: "That's my name. Don't wear it out."

Paul Reubens: Going Beyond The Bow Tie: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: He played dozens of memorable roles on big and small screens throughout his career. We've rounded up what to watch and where to watch it.
Paul Reubens, who died on Sunday at age 70, will always be remembered for his beloved alter ego, the perpetually childlike Pee-wee Herman -- a character so popular that it was able to carry a stage show, movies and a TV series. But Reubens also made memorable impressions playing a variety of supporting characters of the big and small screens -- like Penguin's father in "Batman Returns" and the turtleneck-wearing fixer Mr. Vargas in "The Blacklist," just to name a few out of dozens.
Looking for more? Here is a list of Reubens's greatest hits and how to watch them. (Note that his recurring Emmy-nominated turn on "Murphy Brown" as the network president's nephew is not included because that series's original run is not streaming. Start the petition!)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
'Pee-wee's Big Adventure' (1985)
Rent or buy it on most major platforms.
This film may well be one of the most extravagantly weird comedies of the 1980s -- and possibly ever. A breakthrough for both Reubens and the director Tim Burton, the film built on the Reubens's live show, which had been captured for an HBO special in 1981 (and is available on Max). Strapped into a fitted gray suit with a bright red bow tie, his face a collection of sharp angles in a kid's idea of Kabuki makeup, Pee-wee is simultaneously innocent and crafty, unencumbered by social mores and deliciously arch, accessible to all and cultishly weird. And Reubens brought him to life in a performance of utter physical and verbal precision.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
'Pee-wee's Playhouse' (1986-1990)
Buy it on several major platforms.
Like the finest children's shows, this series delighted both the younger set and its parents. The first could laugh at Pee-wee's antics and his gallery of wacky friends, while the second would get a kick out of the double entendres, the brilliant art direction and the surreal guest stars -- like Grace Jones turning up to sing "The Little Drummer Boy" in a Christmas special. The show, which aired for five seasons on CBS on Saturday mornings, remains one of the oddest productions to ever land on American televisions.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
'Flight of the Navigator' (1986)
Stream it on Disney+ .
Reubens had distinctive intonations, and he put them to good use in extensive voice work, especially during the 2010s. An earlier example is this family friendly science-fiction film from 1986 in which he voiced Max, the computer helming the Trimaxion Drone Ship on which the pint-size hero, David (Joey Cramer), found himself. Sadly, Reubens's second outing with the movie's director, Randal Kleiser, did not turn out quite as charmingly: It was "Big Top Pee-wee," the disappointing sequel to "Pee-wee's Big Adventure." (The final entry in the movie trilogy, "Pee-wee's Big Holiday," premiered on Netflix in 2016.)
'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' (1992)
Stream it on Max .
The year after Reubens's career was temporarily derailed by indecent exposure charges in 1991, he began quietly making his way back with small, quirky roles like Amilyn, the henchman of a vampire kingpin (Rutger Hauer), in the original "Buffy" movie. Sporting a dashing goatee and looking as if he'd just escaped from a prog-rock band, Reubens chewed the scenery with gusto. He fully embraced camp in a death-by-stake scene that went over the top, and then did not even stop there. (It continued after the end credits.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993)
Stream it on Disney+ .
Reubens reunited with Burton for this stop-motion classic in which he voiced Lock, who with Shock (Catherine O'Hara) and Barrel (the composer Danny Elfman, who did the music for "Big Adventure") forms a trio of minions who are "Halloween's finest trick-or-treaters." Together, they assist the villain Oogie Boogie (Ken Page) and, most important, sing "Kidnap the Sandy Claws." Reubens and his team even went on to perform the song live.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
'30 Rock' (2007)
Stream it on Hulu and Peacock .
Reubens's gift for the, shall we say, unusual found one of its most outlandishly grotesque outlets with the simultaneously funny and unsettling Prince Gerhardt -- an inbred royal with a terrifying left hand who felt as if a John Waters character had suddenly invaded a prime-time sitcom. Sadly, Gerhardt appears only in Episode 12 of the show's first season.
'Portlandia' (2015)
Stream it on AMC+ ; rent or buy it on most major platforms.
As the lawyer defending a couple of Goths played by Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein in the series's Season 5 finale, Reubens gets a fitting speech that includes the line "Being weird is not a crime!" He turns it into a statement of pride and a rallying cry, as well as a moment of, well, weirdness.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
'Mosaic' (2018)
Stream it on Max .
Reubens was terrific as the gay best friend of a successful author and illustrator played by Sharon Stone in this Utah-set murder drama from Steven Soderbergh and Ed Solomon. Sardonic and supportive, his character, J.C. Schiffer, was the dream confidante, and Reubens beautifully underplayed him. For some insights into his sensibility, you can read his account of shooting the series on his official website, complete with candid photos.

Full text: This month's picks include a bittersweet French comedy, a gutting Serbian social-realist drama, a Mexican true-crime doc and more.
'Everybody Loves Jeanne'
Stream it on Mubi.
Anyone with an overactive inner critic will feel seen and heard by this bittersweet debut feature from the illustrator and filmmaker Céline Devaux, which charts a middle-aged Frenchwoman's coming to terms with grief and professional failure. As Jeanne (Blanche Gardin) deals with the aftermath of her mother's suicide and the televised collapse of her own invention to rid the ocean of microplastics, Devaux imagines her protagonist's anxiety as an animated figure that nags her constantly, voicing Jeanne's worst thoughts about herself. This nifty conceit is one of the many inspired quirks that imbue "Everybody Loves Jeanne" with wit and charm, without undercutting its more serious themes.
With brisk editing and bright colors, the film unfolds as a tale of whimsy. Jeanne travels to Lisbon to clear out her mother's apartment and sell it to save herself from bankruptcy. On the way, she runs into Jean (Laurent Lafitte), a goofy kleptomaniac who claims to know her from her school days. As Jeanne confronts difficult memories (and even ghostly hallucinations) of her mother and exasperating encounters with her ex, her path keeps crossing with that of Jean, whose kooky exterior slowly chips away to reveal his own battles with mental health. Brimming with warmth and hope, "Everybody Loves Jeanne" is a light-as-air tale about the heaviest of themes: the grown-up struggle to love oneself.
'Father'
Stream it on Ovid.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This drama about the failings of corrupt bureaucracy pulls no punches: In its opening scene, a woman (Nada Sargin) storms into the courtyard of a factory with two children in tow, pours gasoline on herself and sets herself on fire. She is the wife of Nikola (Goran Bogdan), who was laid off from a factory two years ago and is still owed his pending wages and severance. Poverty and hunger have driven her to madness, and this spectacle of self-inflicted suffering is her last resort.
Yet the film only has more heartbreak in store for her, and for us. She is sent off to a hospital to recover, and her children are taken away by social services. When Nikola, who spends his days working seasonal construction jobs, tries to get his children back, he is told that his lack of a full-time job makes him unfit to care for them. Faced with a Kafkaesque, no-win conundrum, Nikola sets off on foot to Belgrade -- 300 miles away -- to file an appeal in person with the ministry.
Nikola encounters both misfortunes and small kindnesses along the way, so that his journey becomes a showcase of Serbian society -- of the powers that exploit, and the people that persevere. As he undertakes this Sisyphean quest, the director, Srdan Golubovic maintains an austere, realistic tone that matches Bogdan's heroically stoic performance -- a razor-sharp evocation of the stubbornness that only the very desperate can summon.
'The Harvesters'
Stream it on Tubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Set in the Free State province of South Africa, where white, Christian families tend to vast, golden-yellow fields of maize, Etienne Kallos's feature weaves threads of coming-of-age, queerness, colonial reckoning and pastoral horror into a combustible domestic thriller. The film is arresting in its vivid evocation of the insular world of Free State farmers. Alternating between shots of windswept farmland and claustrophobic close-ups of faces, Kallos conjures the sheltered and overwhelmingly macho environment in which the sensitive Janno (Brent Vermeulen) grows up, trying dutifully to please his religious mother and gruff father. When his mother brings another adolescent boy into the family -- Pieter (Alex van Dyk), an orphan and addict rescued from the streets -- the familiar routines of Janno's life are ruptured, and secrets and repressed feelings come pouring out. Kallos is careful never to overstate any of the film's themes. Instead, he allows calibrated atmospherics and the fantastic performances of the two leads to suggest bigger ideas -- about the saviorism that can underlie adoption, the racialized fear that causes white South African communities to insulate themselves and the toxic masculinity that is so inherent in imperialism.
'Zoo Lock Down'
Stream it or rent it on Fandor.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In 2020, during the pandemic-induced lockdown, the Austrian filmmaker Andreas Horvath took his camera into an eerily vacated world: the Salzburg Zoo. With no visitors around, he was free to observe the lives and routines of the animals and their handlers: the feeding of bears, the cleaning of fish tanks, the grooming of elephants. In "Zoo Lock Down," he combines these stark visual tableaus with bursts of dramatic music that evoke action movies or thrillers. These incongruities emphasize the strange, artificial, even tacky world of the zoo, where leopards prowl in front of painted backgrounds, and lemurs titter in glass cages illuminated by fluorescent lights. Parallels with our own experiences of confinement during the pandemic come to mind, but the film also gets, wordlessly, at something about the nature of spectacle -- about the hubris of ecosystems created and cultivated by humans solely for the purpose of voyeuristic viewing.
'The Lady of Silence: The Mataviejitas Murders'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Between 1998 and 2005, a string of women over 60 years of age were strangled to death in Mexico City by a killer who posed as a social worker. The perpetrator was nicknamed La Mataviejitas, or The Little Old Lady Killer. Elaborate searches, arrests of suspects, and sensationalist media coverage yielded no answers -- until, in 2006, a man saw the killer leaving his neighbor's home and beckoned the police. María José Cuevas's documentary traces the yearslong hunt for the murderer, Juana Barraza, who became known as Mexico's first female serial killer.
There's plenty in "The Lady of Silence: The Mataviejitas Murders" to whet the appetites of true-crime nuts -- Cuevas combines interviews, re-enactments, and snazzy visuals to recreate the macabre mystery. But the film also takes a keen look at the failures of the justice system and the ways in which gender stereotypes influenced the case. Though witnesses claimed the killer was a woman, investigators believed that only a man would have been strong enough to strangle the victims to death, and they began persecuting gay and trans sex workers. Activists interviewed by Cuevas in the film also noted the staggering number of unsolved femicides in Mexico, which, in contrast to the "little old lady" rhetoric of the police and the media in the Mataviejitas murders, attract victim-blaming comments about young women's life choices.
With her careful attention to everyone who bore the brunt of the killings -- from the victims and their family members to innocent people who were illegally detained and arrested -- Cuevas paints a portrait not just of a crime, but also of the projections and fears that often cloud pursuits of justice.

Paul Reubens, Zany 'Pee-wee' Whose Routine Was a Scream, Dies at 70: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With his bow tie, short drainpipe pants and flattop hairdo, Pee-wee became enshrined in the popular imagination as a symbol of childlike whimsy.
Paul Reubens, the comic actor whose bow-tied, childlike alter-ego Pee-wee Herman became an unlikely if almost uncategorizable movie and television sensation in the 1980s, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 70.
His death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was confirmed on Monday by his longtime representative, Kelly Bush Novak, who said he had "privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit."
"Please accept my apology for not going public with what I've been facing the last six years," Mr. Reubens said in a statement released with the announcement of his death. "I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you."
Mr. Reubens had scores of acting credits in a career that began in the 1960s, including roles on "Murphy Brown," "The Blacklist" and many other television series and in movies like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (1992), "Batman Returns" (1992) and "Blow" (2001).
But Pee-wee, a character he created in the late 1970s as a 10-minute bit when he was a member of the Los Angeles comedy troupe the Groundlings, overshadowed all else, morphing into a bizarre and savvy cultural phenomenon, a character aimed (at least in its TV incarnation) at children but tapping into adult sensibilities and ambiguities.
After being disappointed after auditioning unsuccessfully for the "Saturday Night Live" cast in 1980, Mr. Reubens set about creating "The Pee-wee Herman Show," which was billed as a "live onstage TV pilot." It had its premiere in early 1981 at the Groundlings Theater in Los Angeles. A national tour followed, and HBO broadcast a version of it as a comedy special in 1981.
Pee-wee started turning up on late-night talk shows, especially "Late Night With David Letterman," where the juxtaposition of the idiosyncratic Pee-wee and the laid-back, somewhat befuddled Mr. Letterman was comedy gold. "Pee-wee's Big Adventure," a feature film directed by Tim Burton, was a hit in 1985.

Then, in 1986, came "Pee-wee's Playhouse," a children-friendly version of the world according to Pee-wee that would air on CBS for five years and carve out an enduring place in the memories of 1980s children and, often, their parents.
"Pee-wee's Playhouse" stands as one of the oddest, most audacious, most unclassifiable shows in television history. The man-boy Pee-wee and a vast collection of human and nonhuman characters -- there was, for instance, Chairry, a talking armchair that gave hugs -- held forth in each episode about, well, it's hard to summarize. There was a word of the day. There were bizarre toys. In one episode, Pee-wee married a fruit salad.
The show arrived in the midst of Ronald Reagan's presidential administration and harked back to another button-down era, the one Mr. Reubens lived as a child: the 1950s.
"I saw it as very Norman Rockwell," he told The New York Times in 2016, "but it was my Norman Rockwell version of the '50s, which was more all-inclusive."
Laurence Fishburne, S. Epatha Merkerson and other actors of color were in the cast. Gilbert Lewis, who was Black, was the King of Cartoons.
"Not just anybody -- the king!" Mr. Reubens said. "That came out of growing up in Florida under segregation. I felt really good about that."
The show was a world away from standard educational TV for children -- its lessons, if any, were delivered through wackiness rather than didactically, and its presentation was decidedly nonlinear.
"I never set out to do a big educational show," Mr. Reubens told Newsday in 1989. "We're trying to expose children to as much creativity as we can muster in a half-hour, to be entertaining and to transmit some subliminal messages, like nonconformity isn't bad."
The show had not been on long before academics and cultural critics were analyzing its appeal with weighty papers and other commentaries, but Mr. Reubens was having none of that.
"I've been almost paranoid about dissecting it too much," he said, "because the character always has been a kind of instinctual gut thing. I'm able to turn it on, and it just kind of flows. I do what I want and hope it connects."
The wheels of his career came off in July 1991, when he was arrested on a charge of indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in Sarasota, Fla., where he had grown up. The arrest led to a small fine, but the headlines damaged his reputation.
"Pee-wee's Playhouse" was in reruns at the time, and CBS pulled them off the air. There were no more new episodes. Mr. Reubens said later that he had been planning a hiatus from show business anyway.
In any case, he took a long break from his alter-ego, but neither Mr. Reubens nor Pee-wee was done.
Mr. Reubens continued to act, receiving an Emmy Award nomination for a guest appearance on "Murphy Brown" in 1995. (His character arc on that show continued for five more episodes.) He also weathered a second scandal: In 2002, he was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of possessing child pornography as a result of images found by the authorities in his collection of vintage erotica. He was sentenced to probation on a reduced charge of possessing obscene material.
"The moment that I realized my name was going to be said in the same sentence as children and sex, that's really intense," Mr. Reubens told NBC in 2004. "That's something I knew from that very moment, whatever happens past that point, something's out there in the air that is really bad."
Then, about 2008, some producers began suggesting that he revive the Pee-wee character and some version of the 1980s stage show. He was somewhat reluctant.
"There were age-related issues to it," Mr. Reubens told The Times in 2010, since he was by then in his 50s. "There were career-standing issues."
He waffled.
"Every two months, I would change my mind," he told The Chicago Sun Times in 2010. "And then, finally, one day I woke up and decided, 'This is it, I'm coming back."'
The new version of "The Pee-wee Herman Show" opened at Club Nokia in Los Angeles in January 2010, featuring elements of the original stage show and characters from the TV series. It opened on Broadway that November for a limited run.
"Mr. Reubens's Silly Putty face is a little puttier, but it remains as stretchable as ever," Charles Isherwood wrote in his review in The Times. "His Popsicle-stick posture retains its comical rigidity; the flapping arms express exasperation and excitement with no loss of tone; the bopping Pee-wee dance is still beach-ball-buoyant. And of course Pee-wee's restless imagination and childish mood swings are as extravagant as ever."
A new movie, "Pee-wee's Big Holiday," followed in 2016 on Netflix, produced by Mr. Reubens and Judd Apatow. Mr. Reubens told The Times in 2010, when the film was in the early talking stages, that it was no surprise that Pee-wee had endured.
"There's never been anything from the fans other than, please do more," he said.
Paul Rubenfeld was born on Aug. 27, 1952, in Peekskill, N.Y., to Milton and Judy (Rosen) Rubenfeld. His mother was a teacher, and his father had been a pilot who, according to The Forward, helped smuggle fighter planes into Israel in 1948 during its war of independence.
The family moved to Sarasota when Paul was 9. His parents ran a lamp store there. Paul had been in school and camp theatrical productions when he graduated to a bigger stage: At 11, he had a key role as the young nephew in a custody dispute in Herb Gardner's play "A Thousand Clowns," staged by the Sarasota Players.
"The 12-year-old is played with remarkable assurance and stage-wise technique by Paul Rubenfeld, himself only 11 years old, a genuine talent discovery," Ray Perkins wrote in a review in The Tampa Bay Times.
"Young Actor Big Crowd Pleaser" read a headline in the same newspaper a few days later over a feature article about him.
He appeared in several other shows with the Sarasota Players and also acted with the Asolo Theater Company (now Asolo Repertory). He spent a year at Boston University after graduating from Sarasota High School in 1970, but then went to the West Coast, studying at the California Institute of the Arts and eventually falling in with the Groundlings, working at a pizza parlor and selling brushes while he developed his comedic skills.
Mr. Reubens's first film role, uncredited, was as a wedding guest in the 1968 drama "The Brotherhood," and he had a smattering of other roles before Pee-wee took over. The first name of his enduring character, he said, was borrowed from the tiny Pee Wee harmonica brand. The last name, Herman, was inspired by an irritating childhood acquaintance.
He is survived by a sister, Abby Rubenfeld, and a brother, Luke Rubenfeld.
Just months ago Mr. Reubens said he was working on a memoir and a documentary. And in an interview with The Times around that time, one of his last, he reflected on the longevity of Pee-wee, on the adjustments that were made to keep the character fresh, and on how the creative landscape had changed since Pee-wee first appeared some 40 years ago.
"Today, it seems to me, it's a lot more difficult to stand out," he said. "You know, if you want to be weird, good luck."

Paul Reubens, the comic actor whose bow-tied childlike alter-ego Pee-wee Herman became an unlikely if almost uncategorizable movie and television sensation in the 1980s, died Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 70.
His death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was confirmed Monday by his longtime representative, Kelly Bush Novak, who said he had “privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit.”
“Please accept my apology for not going public with what I’ve been facing the last six years,” Reubens said in a statement released with the announcement of his death. “I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters. I have loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you.”
Reubens had scores of acting credits in a career that began in the 1960s, with roles on “Murphy Brown,” “The Blacklist” and many other television series and in movies including “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” (1992), “Batman Returns” (1992) and “Blow” (2001).
But Pee-wee, a character he created in the late 1970s as a 10-minute bit when he was a member of the Los Angeles comedy troupe the Groundlings, overshadowed all else, morphing into a bizarre and savvy cultural phenomenon, a character aimed (at least in its TV incarnation) at children but tapping into adult sensibilities and ambiguities.
After being disappointed after auditioning unsuccessfully for the “Saturday Night Live” cast in 1980, Reubens set about creating “The Pee-wee Herman Show,” which was billed as a “live onstage TV pilot.” It had its premiere in early 1981 at the Groundlings Theater in Los Angeles.

His death, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was confirmed Monday by his longtime representative Kelly Bush Novak, who said he had “privately fought cancer for years with his trademark tenacity and wit.”
“Please accept my apology for not going public with what I’ve been facing the last six years,” Reubens said in a statement released with the announcement of his death. “I have always felt a huge amount of love and respect from my friends, fans and supporters.

But Pee-wee, a character he created in the late 1970s as a 10-minute bit when he was a member of the Los Angeles comedy troupe the Groundlings, overshadowed all else, morphing into a bizarre and savvy cultural phenomenon, a character aimed (at least in its TV incarnation) at children but tapping into adult sensibilities and ambiguities.

Then, in 1986, came “Pee-wee’s Playhouse,” a children-friendly version of the world according to Pee-wee that aired on CBS for five years and carved out an enduring place in the memories of 1980s children and, often, their parents.
“Pee-wee’s Playhouse” stands as one of the oddest, most audacious, most unclassifiable shows in television history. The androgynous Pee-wee and a vast collection of human and nonhuman characters — there was, for instance, Chairry, a talking armchair that gave hugs — held forth in each episode about, well, it’s hard to summarize. There was a word of the day. There were bizarre toys. In one episode, Pee-wee married a fruit salad.
The show arrived in the midst of Ronald Reagan’s presidential administration and harked back to another button-down era, the one Reubens lived as a child: the 1950s.
‘‘I saw it as very Norman Rockwell,” he told The New York Times in 2016, ‘‘but it was my Norman Rockwell version of the ’50s, which was more all-inclusive.”
Laurence Fishburne, S. Epatha Merkerson and other actors of color were in the cast. Gilbert Lewis, who was Black, was the King of Cartoons.
“Not just anybody — the king!” Reubens said. “That came out of growing up in Florida under segregation. I felt really good about that.”
The show was a world away from standard educational TV for children — its lessons, if any, were delivered through wackiness rather than didactically, and its presentation was decidedly nonlinear.
“I never set out to do a big educational show,” Reubens told Newsday in 1989. “We’re trying to expose children to as much creativity as we can muster in a half-hour, to be entertaining and to transmit some subliminal messages like nonconformity isn’t bad.”
The show had not been on long before academics and cultural critics were analyzing it and its appeal with weighty papers and other commentaries, but Reubens was having none of that.
“I’ve been almost paranoid about dissecting it too much,” he said, “because the character always has been a kind of instinctual gut thing. I’m able to turn it on and it just kind of flows. I do what I want and hope it connects.”
The wheels of his career came off in July 1991, when Reubens was arrested on a charge of indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in Sarasota, Florida, where he had grown up. The arrest led to a small fine, but the headlines damaged his reputation.
“Pee-wee’s Playhouse” was in reruns at the time, and CBS pulled those reruns off the air. There were no more new episodes. Reubens said later that he had been planning a hiatus from show business anyway. In any case, he took a long break from his alter-ego, but neither Reubens nor Pee-wee was done.
Reubens continued to act, receiving an Emmy Award nomination for a guest appearance on “Murphy Brown” in 1995. (His character arc on that show continued for five more episodes.)
He also weathered a second scandal — in 2002 he was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of possessing child pornography as a result of images found by authorities in his collection of vintage erotica; he was eventually sentenced to probation on a reduced charge of possessing obscene material.
“The moment that I realized my name was going to be said in the same sentence as children and sex, that’s really intense,” Reubens told NBC in 2004. “That’s something I knew from that very moment, whatever happens past that point, something’s out there in the air that is really bad.”
Then, about 2008, some producers began suggesting he revive the Pee-wee character and some version of the 1980s stage show.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Even when the big success finally came, it hardly came easily for Jennifer Brady.
She made her breakthrough at the 2020 U.S. Open near the height of the coronavirus pandemic, reaching the semifinals amid strict public health measures and the silence of a vast Arthur Ashe Stadium without any paying spectators.
When she backed that performance up four months later by reaching the Australian Open final, she did it after spending two weeks in hard quarantine in a Melbourne hotel. She smacked tennis balls against a mattress that she had propped against a wall and pedaled a stationary bike in the bathroom with the door closed and a hot shower running to try to replicate the tournament's often steamy conditions.
Her deep run was a remarkable, resilient effort that put her on the brink of the top 10 of the singles rankings. But as the world and her sport slowly returned to something closer to normal, Brady was nowhere to be seen on tour.
She was out of action for nearly two years with a chronic foot condition and a knee injury that, combined, sometimes left her, in her words, "in a very dark place," curled up on the floor in tears, even looking at her troublesome left foot on occasion and wishing she could "just chop it off."
Brady, who had played her last competitive match in August 2021, returned to action last week for an International Tennis Federation satellite tournament in Granby, Quebec, winning a round before losing in straight sets to Himeno Sakatsume, a Japanese player ranked 223rd.
Brady plans to return to the main WTA Tour next week in Washington, D.C., for the DC Open.
"It was unbelievable, just being out there," Brady said in a telephone interview from Granby. "Just engaging and just having a crowd there, and people enjoying good tennis. I definitely missed this. I didn't think I would be as comfortable as I was. I'm happy I was able to show people that I'm still here."
'It Seems Like There's a Lot of Opportunity'
Though Brady no longer had a WTA ranking after her long layoff, she has a protected ranking that will allow her entry into 12 tour-level events. That does not count wild cards, and given her past success, she is likely to receive several, although she plans to use her protected ranking to enter the U.S. Open next month.
With a thunderous forehand that often led her to practice with boys in her youth, Brady, 28, was long considered one of the most promising American players. She knows there are no guarantees of a successful comeback. She was aiming initially to return for the French Open in May. She had her hotel room and plane ticket booked but then suffered a new injury, a bone bruise in her right foot, in her final practice session before her planned departure.
As she returns this month, she senses an opening. She avoided watching much pro tennis in her long absence but she is well aware that Marketa Vondrousova recently became the first unseeded woman to win a Wimbledon singles title.
"The women's game right now, it seems like anybody can win a Grand Slam tournament," Brady said. "It seems like there's a lot of opportunity."
Brady no longer has a personal coach and is traveling instead with Kayla Fujimoto Epperson, a physical therapist. But as she prepared for her comeback in Orlando, she worked daily with Ola Malmqvist, the head of women's tennis at the U.S.T.A., who has known Brady since she was a standout junior.
"I just really, really wish that she gets the chance to put her feet into everything again and see what happens," Malmqvist said. "I think in her mind she definitely feels she can compete with the very best, and I hope she can stay healthy enough and practice enough. She's not going to go four hours a day anymore because of her body, but she can still do enough to get the physicality she needs."
The challenge for Brady has been learning to hold back. "It's almost like I don't trust myself," she said. "I realized it's more about staying healthy and training smarter instead of harder."
She left U.C.L.A. after her sophomore year to turn professional in 2015. But she did not start to soar until she moved her training base to Germany in late 2019 and began working with the German coach Michael Geserer, who favored a high-volume, high-intensity approach.
She returned from the tour's five-month pandemic hiatus in August 2020 and won her opening tournament in Lexington, Ky., foreshadowing her deep run to a U.S. Open semifinal with Naomi Osaka, the eventual champion.
She also lost to Osaka in the 2021 Australian Open final and then retreated to her hotel room again, emotionally and physical drained.
"I just closed the blackout curtains, and I just watched Netflix for, like, three days straight," she said. "It just hit me."
Instead of taking a break, she followed her plan with Geserer and went to the tournament in Doha, Qatar, in February 2021. "I just didn't want to be there," she said. "I love competing, but I just didn't want to compete. Mentally, I was absolutely fried."
She had already experienced some minor foot pain, but in March as she prepared for the Miami Open, she said, she woke up in the "middle of the night with a sharp, stabbing pain" in the sole of her left foot.
She was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis but pressed on. By May, when she played in the Italian Open, she woke up after a match and said she "couldn't walk."
She split with Geserer, in part because she felt they had pushed too hard.
"There was no drama," she said. "It was just a little too much; too much structure at that time period."
She went to the French Open and was in so much pain during her first-round victory over Anastasija Sevastova that she cried during the match. She managed to win her second-round match with Fiona Ferro but began experiencing back spasms in her third-round loss to Coco Gauff and stopped after losing the first set.
"I was compensating for the foot," Brady said. "So, I started having pain everywhere."
'Like Stepping on a Porcupine'
She skipped the grass-court season, received a cortisone injection and a platelet-rich plasma injection in her foot but lost in the first round at the Tokyo Olympics and returned to the U.S. to try to get ready for the 2021 U.S. Open.
"Some mornings I would wake up, and I'd be like, 'Oh my God, I'm healed, like, it's gone!"' she said. "And then I'd go on court, and I'd be like, 'Damn, it's not.' I also had a ton of nerve compression, nerve pain. It wasn't just plantar fasciitis. So, it was like stepping on a porcupine every step, and I was so sensitive that I would have to take my shoe and sock off because my foot would be so hot. It felt like somebody was lighting a match on my skin."
She played the Western and Southern Open on painkillers and was feeling good in her second-round match against Jelena Ostapenko before experiencing new pain in her right knee. She remembers running for a short ball late in the second set and feeling "like an explosion in my left heel."
"I immediately couldn't put weight on it," she said.
She retired from the match and soon withdrew from the U.S. Open. She had a stress fracture in her right knee and would later discover that she also had a partial tear in her left plantar fascia. She had right knee surgery in March 2022 to repair cartilage damage but still had lingering foot pain.
"Anytime I would feel pain, I would freak out because I'd be like, it's back to where it was," she said. "And I'd lose sleep over it; so many negative thoughts start rolling in the back of my head."
There has been angst about finances. Brady's time near the top in women's tennis was brief and though she has earned more than $ 4.6 million in prize money, pro tennis has plenty of overhead. And her medical bills, even with insurance, have been stacking up during her long layoff.
"I don't want to blow through all my money," she said.
Brady added: "When can I start doing my job?"
The answer, at last, is now.

Gritty and Steamy TV Melodrama Has Italian Fans in a Frenzy: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Italy falls for "Mare Fuori," a television melodrama about the inmates of a juvenile detention center who pass the time making out -- when not scowling at or occasionally stabbing one another.
Before dawn, the teenage girls convened outside the Naples Navy base where the wildly popular Italian television show "Mare Fuori" is filmed.
"We want to show them all of our love," said Federica Montuori, 16, who with her fellow fans unfurled white sheets with spray-painted messages expressing how the lead actors, who play star-crossed -- and mobbed-up -- lovers in a juvenile prison, "belong in our hearts."
On the wall beside her, the scrawls on the bricks are love letters to "the most beautiful series in the world" and its main characters. "Ti Amo Carmine," read one rectangle. "Ti Amo Rosa," read another.
Other fans have dived from nearby piers and swum to the back of the set, vexing gate guards charged with keeping them at bay. During the day, their screams have ruined takes.
"We had to stop shooting," said Ivan Silvestrini, the show's director. "They won't listen. It's pretty unbearable, but what can you do?"
Italy has fallen for "Mare Fuori," or "The Sea Beyond," an often gritty but always soapy melodrama about the inmates of a coed juvenile detention center who pass the time stealing kisses -- when not scowling at or occasionally stabbing one another.
Entering its fourth season, the show, set and steeped in Naples street life, is "Saved by the Bell" meets "Scared Straight" meets "Gomorrah" meets Skinemax. It has been a smash hit on Italian television and is a fixture on Netflix Italy's most-watched list. During Carnevale, children dressed up as the precocious gangsters, with leather hot pants and jackets, tank tops, lots of chains and toy guns.
Its hypnotic theme song, recorded by an actor who plays an inmate on the show and who is also an increasingly popular singer in Italy, has been streamed 35 million times and gone platinum. Some fans have kept vigil singing the chorus outside the set.
The series tells the intertwining stories of a hodgepodge of attractive delinquents, in a fictitious juvenile hall inspired by a real one -- where the sexes are separated -- on an island off Naples. Most of the characters are hardened thugs from competing Naples mob families, but there is also a rich Milanese piano prodigy jailed after a night out in Naples goes terribly awry, and a manipulative goth goddess who licks faces, cuts herself and kills for fun.
The cast of mostly unknowns keeps the budget low, but the ensemble approach is also creating stars to supply Italy's insatiable and often schlocky television-cinema complex.
The producers market the show as a dialect-heavy portrayal of Naples reality with a redemption message. But following on other Italian hits, like "Baby," about underage prostitutes, the show has also underscored Italy's infatuation with steamy young adult programming.
"We have realized that these stories of young lovers, people like a lot," said Roberto Sessa, one of the show's producers. "In the end, we are a romantic country."
The plot revolves around Carmine Di Salvo, the reluctant and seemingly meek scion of a crime family who really just wants to be a barber, but who lands behind bars after stabbing a would-be rapist of his girlfriend in the neck with scissors. Incarcerated, he finds a nemesis in Ciro, the prince of the competing crime family, who eventually tries to kill Carmine and his piano-playing cellmate but who ends up getting stabbed with a screwdriver.
Things really took off in the third season, this year, when Rosa Ricci, the late Ciro's sister, shoots a guy to get into jail so she can settle scores with Carmine. In classic Montague and Capulet style, she falls for Carmine instead.
On a street in Naples, a fan of the show, Domenico Marino, 18, and his girlfriend considered taking home a souvenir pillow -- displayed next to similar shirts, mugs and key chains -- of the scantily clad Rosa featuring her catchphrase ("I am Rosa Ricci, and who the [expletive] are you to tell me what I need to do"). He decided on a cushion of her late brother Ciro instead.
On Naples's Via San Gregorio Armeno, famous for its Christmas nativity scenes, a crowd gathered to admire terra cotta figurines of the cast standing in front of the juvenile prison, displayed next to a manger.
"We keep making them as long as there is demand, even for the ones who get killed," said Elio Cassano, 60. "They don't look at the soccer players or the Holy Family in the crèche, they form crowds around 'Mare Fuori."'
One of the admirers, Chiara D'Amico, 18, a Sicilian with a crush on Carmine, said the juvenile prison reminded her of high school. Her mother, Santina Santonocito, 40, said she liked the show because it taught children "not to make errors -- life inside is not so easy."
They were visiting Naples, with plans to see its castles and eat pizza. "But the first thing on the list," Ms. D'Amico said, was a pilgrimage to the set.
Shortly before noon, a black van carrying Maria Esposito, 19, who plays Rosa, rolled up to the gate. She blew kisses from the passenger seat, sending the fans into a tizzy.
On the set -- which looked like a seaside high school with a soccer court, a foosball table and a black piano that had hearts traced in its dust -- she stopped in hair and makeup with Massimiliano Caiazzo, who plays Carmine.
"The theme of a forbidden love touches adults just as it touches adolescents," said Mr. Caiazzo, 26, as Ms. Esposito, puffing on an e-cigarette, had her lashes doused in mascara.
She had worked as an aesthetician before she joined at the end of the second season, which had made her "weep perennially, every day, with joy."
But for a young woman who loves going out ("I love living"), it was not easy being the face of Naples, she said. "I'm walking around the streets with my face on the pillows," she said. "It's a little creepy."
The costume designer, Rossella Aprea, said that since there was no uniform in a real Italian juvenile prison, she could use her imagination. At a rack dedicated to Rosa, she held up a skimpy leotard decorated with dragons.
"A lot of black, super tight, crop tops," she said. "Skin, skin, skin."
Outside, the director struggled with a scene about the arrival of a new inmate, who held a leather satchel and looked as if he had either returned from safari or robbed a Banana Republic.
"Tell him to come out of the car and look towards the girls," Mr. Silvestrini instructed with frustration. He said he understood sex appeal was vital to the show's success and required the suspension of disbelief about love in the detention center through the creation of imaginary circumstances for hooking up, what he called "room for romance."
"We created a pizza lab, a place where the boys and girls can be together," he said. "And they can be promiscuous."
After lunch, the director ordered the activation of a smoke machine for atmosphere, then walked a 40-something actor who played a crooked guard and a 20-something actress who played an inmate through their scene.
"Then, at a certain point," he instructed. "The kiss moment."
Their moment extended to a full-on make out session, lasting so long that the crew gave each other awkward looks.
Soon after, Ms. Esposito walked on set for the day's final scene.
"She's my star," Mr. Silvestrini said.
Ms. Esposito, rail thin and with long straight black hair, wore bell-bottomed tight leather pants and a leather halter top. "These pants have gotten loose on me," she said, laughing. "I've lost weight from the stress!"
She said everywhere she went, she was mobbed by teenagers, "but also the adults."
"It's in the hearts of all, this series," Ms. Esposito said.
She and Mr. Caiazzo acted an intense face-to-face scene on a staircase, the director called it a wrap and the crew blasted the "Mare Fuori" song. Soon after, the stars departed in separate vans, and the fans screamed and ran after them.
Ms. Esposito made a heart sign with her hands.
"Rosa Ricci," they bellowed. "Bellissima."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actor, who was cleared of sexual assault charges in Britain this week, has parts in two small upcoming films. Yet his tarnished public perception makes starry roles unlikely.
The two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey said last month that he was ready to return to acting after years in the wilderness following sexual assault allegations.
"I know that there are people right now who are ready to hire me the moment I am cleared of these charges in London," Mr. Spacey told a German magazine, referring to accusations that he had assaulted four men. "The second that happens, they're ready to move forward."
Mr. Spacey was right in several ways: A British jury found him not guilty of nine counts of sexual assault this week, nearly a year after a federal jury in Manhattan cleared him of battery in a civil case filed by the actor Anthony Rapp. And he has two small projects awaiting release, with directors who could not be more publicly supportive.
But the starry Hollywood roles, like Mr. Spacey's conniving politician in "House of Cards" and droll advertising executive in "American Beauty," may not come back anytime soon, if at all.
Despite Mr. Spacey's legal successes, his public perception is tarnished and a turnoff to studios and streaming services desperate to avoid controversy, said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts.
"He's in real trouble," said Mr. Galloway, who previously served as executive editor of The Hollywood Reporter. "On the 0-to-10 scale, this is like a minus one."
During Mr. Spacey's trial in Britain, he testified about the damage to his career after the public accusations began to emerge in 2017. "There was a rush to judgment and before the first question was asked or answered, I lost my job, I lost my reputation, I lost everything," he said.
Within months of the initial allegation, Mr. Spacey's character was killed off in the final season of "House of Cards," his scenes as J. Paul Getty in "All the Money in the World" were reshot with a different actor, and Netflix scrapped the film "Gore," in which he played the writer Gore Vidal.
Beyond two recently filmed parts listed on IMDb, a movie database, it is unclear whether Mr. Spacey is attached to any new projects. His team did not respond to a request for comment, and Mr. Spacey did not provide career insight after being acquitted this week. "I imagine that many of you can understand that there's a lot for me to process," he said from the courthouse steps.
Mike Paul, a public relations expert who specializes in reputation and crisis management, said that considering the nature of the accusations Mr. Spacey faced, he must avoid "pouring gasoline back on issues that you don't want gasoline on." Hollywood, he said, wants to see a time of reflection and quiet analysis.
The best bet, Mr. Galloway said, is for Mr. Spacey to develop projects for his production company, Trigger Street, or to pursue indie projects that value his acting prowess or consider the publicity a boon.
Mr. Spacey's two known upcoming roles are in minor movies: "Control," a British film in which he plays a hacker who takes over a politician's smart car (his part is voice only), and "Peter Five Eight," a comedic thriller in which he plays a shadowy stranger who arrives in a small mountainside community.
Michael Zaiko Hall, the writer and director of "Peter Five Eight," said in an email that the film, which does not have an official release date, represented a return to the smaller independent films with which Mr. Spacey started his career.
"We have here a double Oscar winner with legendary screen presence whose name has just been cleared," Mr. Hall said. "I imagine there will be a thaw period, followed by a re-emergence into the culture."
Gene Fallaize, the writer and director of "Control," said that he approached Mr. Spacey for the voice role last fall, and that the recent verdict showed "our gamble had paid off." Before the jury's decision, his movie had distribution deals in Germany, Russia and the Middle East. Now, Mr. Fallaize said, it was negotiating with American and British distributors.
Mr. Fallaize added that Mr. Spacey might need to do independent movies for a year or two, showing he could generate commercial returns, before major studios would be prepared to work with him. Those movies might have to be in countries that have a more "lenient" view to allegations made against stars, Mr. Fallaize added.
"It's more likely for Europe to be receptive," agreed Dominik Sedlar, a Croatian-born director and friend of Mr. Spacey's whose father made a movie this year in which the actor played the country's first president.
Mr. Sedlar said that although Mr. Spacey had twice been vindicated by juries, Hollywood studios might keep shunning the actor "rather than admit they were wrong."
In recent years, both the Venice and Cannes film festivals have been happy to showcase work by directors and actors whose reputation has been stained in the United States, including Woody Allen, Roman Polanski and Johnny Depp. On Thursday, spokeswomen for both festivals said their artistic directors were unavailable to comment on Mr. Spacey.
There was similar reluctance from members of the London theater world, where Mr. Spacey was a regular star in the 1990s and 2000s and served as the artistic director of the Old Vic theater from 2004 to 2015. Representatives for 15 producers, West End theater owners and artistic directors either turned down or did not respond to interview requests to discuss Mr. Spacey's future.
Alistair Smith, editor of The Stage, Britain's major theater newspaper, said in an email that Mr. Spacey's return was "highly unlikely." In 2017 the Old Vic published the findings of an independent investigation into Mr. Spacey's tenure that revealed that 20 unnamed people accused him of unstated inappropriate behavior.
"Those allegations have never been satisfactorily addressed by Spacey," Mr. Smith said. "Unless they are, I can't see him working in London theater again."
Comebacks have always been hard in Hollywood, which may be politically liberal but is artistically and financially conservative. For those who have succeeded, such as Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr., the road was long.
"You need to completely reset your reputation," Mr. Galloway said. In "fortress Hollywood, the drawbridge is pulled up, and it's a dangerous moat to swim across."
Illustration Top, Kevin Spacey was found not guilty of sexual assault this week, but for many people in the film industry, his reputation has been tarnished. One of his next roles is in a comedic thriller, "Peter Five Eight," right, which does not have an official release date yet.

Grief in the Small Irish Village Where a Singer Sought Sanctuary: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For three years, the singer, who died this week, found simplicity and happiness in a mountain sanctuary where she was just another neighbor.
Few people come to Knockananna without good reason, the journey requiring a long, serpentine drive up the country roads that wind through Ireland's Wicklow Mountains.
And the village itself is a simple place, little more than a crossroads with a pub, a smattering of pretty white stone houses -- some with thatched roofs -- and a shop with a single gas pump out front. Cellphone service is patchy, adding to the world-apart feeling.
But some people do find their way to Knockananna, among them Sinéad O'Connor, who enjoyed a sanctuary of sorts in the village during some of the final years of her life.
"Down the mountain, as I call it, nobody can forget about Sinéad O'Connor," the musician said in a 2021 interview. In the village, she said, nobody much cared -- "which is beautiful for me."
Ms. O'Connor described becoming friends with the local women who came by offering bread and scones, welcoming her to a place where everyone knows everyone else but which can nevertheless still feel a bit lonely.
"We bury bodies for each other," she said. "It's lovely having friends."
Now those friends, and the village that asked little of her but offered much, are remembering Ms. O'Connor with fondness and familiarity following her death on Wednesday at age 56.
For years the singer had fought mental health battles. It was no secret to her neighbors in Knockananna.
"I hope that her happy was here, you know?" said Jude, 57, who became close with Ms. O'Connor, her voice cracking with emotion. "Because that's all she ever really wanted to be -- was just what other people take for granted."
Jude, who like others in the village asked that her last name not be used over privacy concerns, remembers arriving at the door with scones when her new neighbor first arrived up the road in early 2020.
For all her fame, Knockananna's newest resident was content with a simple life.
She watched crime thrillers on Netflix on a television the size of the wall. She knit, fed horses and smoked -- a lot.
Ms. O'Connor, who was born near Dublin, also wrote a bit for Irish newspapers, which she loved doing, Jude said. The two women talked about everything from the philosophical to the frivolous. "She has a wicked sense of humor, too," Jude said. "She just gave you that look."
Ms. O'Connor's son Shane was a frequent visitor, and she would often fry him breakfast on the weekend.
"All she just wanted was not to be lonely," Jude said. "That's all. And her time here, it was, I suppose, it was one of a very fulfilling time, because she was just a mammy here."
Residents of the community were quite protective of the singer, even those who barely knew her. She came and went as she pleased, mostly keeping to herself, and they let her be. Even when she went through trying times.
Patsy, who was tending the flower baskets outside of O'Keeffe's pub at the heart of Knockananna, shook his head and muttered the word, "terrible" as he spoke of Ms. O'Connor's death.
She never really went to the pub, which was closed because of coronavirus restrictions during most of the time she lived here. And besides, she wasn't a drinker. But she did visit the little shop up the road, buying ice cream and bread and other bits and bobs.
"She struggled with her nerves you know," Patsy said, putting carefully what villagers knew: that the musician's troubles had a way of finding their way in. She was frequently in and out St Patrick's psychiatric hospital in Dublin; she would joke that they had a room there just for her.
Her happiness in the village burned bright but for a short time. In early 2022, her son Shane died by suicide, at 17. Even Knockananna no longer felt like a sanctuary. Ms. O'Connor sold her home on the main street.
"There's only so much loneliness a human can take," Jude said. "And she had dealt with so many tragedies, dramas, terrible things in her mind, whether they were real or not real. She dealt with them. And she just couldn't keep on dealing."
In life and in death, many people tried to claim a piece of the musician.
On Thursday, in the seaside town of Bray that Ms. O'Connor had called home for over a decade before moving to her mountain retreat at the start of the pandemic, a steady stream of fans left handwritten tributes and bouquets by her home, and television crews set up live shots.
"Thank you for the music," read one note. Another offered an apology: "I am sorry for how you were treated and pray that you have found peace."
Knockananna is not a place for such ostentatious display. Villagers were happy to celebrate their neighbor, just quietly. Even for the launch of her 2021 memoir, "Rememberings," Ms. O'Connor had a dinner party with a small group of friends in the village to toast the book.
"Those who think they know her so well, you know, did they know how many sugars she took in her tea? Too many," Jude said with a laugh. She drank it out of a big tin cup, because she thought it kept it hot longer.
On Thursday, Ms. O'Connor's house was a construction site. Its new owners are doing work, and a red wooden door, its top panels broken, lay in the front yard among the detritus of other building materials. It was a remnant of a previous life.
Jude said she would miss the new neighbor who became a friend.
"I hope that the light that she had here is shining somewhere where there's unconditional love," she said. "This world wasn't big enough for her light to be cherished. I don't think we understood her enough."

Full text: Mendel Goldberg, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, opened his shop in the late 1800s. Four generations later, it's a go-to destination for top costume designers.
Step behind the unassuming facade of Mendel Goldberg Fabrics on Manhattan's Lower East Side and you'll suddenly find yourself surrounded by an array of gorgeous fabrics on its floor-to-ceiling shelves: bolts and neatly folded stacks of fine cottons, silks, satins, taffetas and lace as well as more opulent materials, from bubble-gum pink metallic brocade to apple green silk satin jacquard and shimmery pleated navy chiffon. There are fabrics woven with gold thread or glittering with Swarovski crystals. And there is Chanel-style wool bouclé in pale pink, or black and white woven with little ribbons and pearls. The material is as luxuriously textured as a lamb's coat. I want it.
I don't sew. I haven't got the DNA (no one in my family did). I've never really paid attention to the world of bespoke clothing or the fabrics a designer might use, not until a few months ago, when I went to Hester Street -- a street once jammed with pushcarts and now crowded with delivery bikes -- and walked into Mendel Goldberg, where, feeling as if I'd wandered into a psychedelic dreamscape, I coveted everything.
Presiding over the shop from her usual perch, above a large wooden table where she measures out the fabric, was proprietor Alice Goldberg, wearing a fitted white blouse, a narrow beige skirt with a zipper up the back and black flats. Goldberg is the fourth generation of her family to run the store since her great-grandfather Mendel founded it. Alongside Luis Ortega, the Goldbergs' aide-de-camp since 1989, Alice has witnessed a few memorable shopping sprees, including the time a few years back when a group of Saudi princesses spent about 30 minutes in the store, "buying like crazy," and the day seven bridesmaids purchased beaded sky blue tulle for their dresses.
Costume designers are also frequent customers. Among them is John Glaser, who oversaw the wardrobe for season one of Netflix's "Bridgerton" (along with Ellen Mirojnick) as well as that for the upcoming season three. "You can get things here you can't get anywhere else, like certain very rich and expensive over-embroidered or beaded material," Glaser says. He's used Mendel Goldberg's fabrics for a number of the costumes for the Regency-era period drama, including a sheer white frock in laser cut silk chiffon, a fabric that "we used inside out," Glaser adds. "There was also a dress for Lady Bridgerton made of pale blue silk jacquard that reminded me of an 18th-century wallpaper."
While I'm in the shop, I watch as Goldberg drapes ivory gazar against a bride-to-be, showing her how it would work as an engagement party dress. Later that afternoon, Tsigie White, the costume designer for the TV series "Power Book III: Raising Kanan," stops in. She's mesmerized by a piece of gold material covered with glittering paillettes. "I'll find something to do with it for the show," she says while Goldberg measures a yard of it for her. "I've never been here before; a friend mentioned it," she continues. "This is a great find for me."
Goldberg knows her stock by heart, and even the stores's website -- seemingly the business's largest concession to the 21st century -- is wonderfully detailed, the fabrics carefully described and shown draped on mannequins. Goldberg's customers are based all over the country, as well as abroad; some of them ask to browse the fabrics over Zoom or FaceTime. "I want everyone to buy on the internet with the same confidence as if they walked in the store. Let's say you're in Texas and you order something online. I don't want you to open [the package] and say, 'Oh my God,' " she says. "I want you to be thrilled."
It's a long way from the days when Mendel Goldberg, a Jewish immigrant from Poland, sold tailoring supplies off a pushcart on the Lower East Side. In 1890, he opened the shop in this five-floor building. (The basement is now the stockroom; apartments occupy the upper four stories.) His son Alexander sold silk to furriers for coat linings; Alexander's son Samuel -- Alice's father -- sold fabric to Gimbels and Macy's, both of which had large departments for home dressmaking.
The business prospered. Alice was born in Brooklyn and spent her later childhood years in Great Neck, N.Y., where her parents lived and commuted to Hester Street. "I was a very sheltered girl," she says. "All my clothes were made for me by my grandma Ida, Alexander's wife."
After college, Alice taught math, married and moved to Manhattan's Upper East Side, where she still lives. She has two daughters, Alexandra, who lives in Jerusalem, and Josefa, who lives in New Rochelle, N.Y. Josefa's daughter Eliana did her recent high-school senior thesis on fashion. If she eventually takes over Mendel Goldberg Fabrics, Eliana will be the sixth generation to manage the business.
Alice Goldberg didn't join the family business until she was in her 30s. Her father came to her home and said, "'Your mother is sick, you have to come into the store.' I walked in and never left," she says.
Her first assignment was a fabric buying trip to Europe. "At some of the great Swiss companies, I saw the most beautiful goods. They asked about my credit because they didn't know me," she says, smiling. "I say, 'Can you do me a favor? Please send someone to tell my driver I'll be here for some time.' I figured if they saw I had a Mercedes with a chauffeur it would be all right." She got the credit, and now travels to Italy, Switzerland and France twice a year.
It isn't just the sumptuous fabrics that make Mendel Goldberg so sought out by connoisseurs, however, but Alice Goldberg herself. "I've never had a return," she says. "Never. How crazy is that?" I'm thinking about a winter coat. As if she's read my mind, she shows me navy blue French wool bouclé and suggests we line it in printed cashmere. As my mother always said, "Why have economy in fantasy?"

The Purposely Private Days of Melania Trump: [National Desk]

Full text: The former first lady has mostly retreated from public view -- and steered clear of the campaign trail -- while her husband fights to return to the White House and faces increasing legal peril.
Since leaving the White House, Melania Trump's world has gotten smaller.
Just how she likes it.
Cloistered behind the gates of her three homes, she sticks to a small circle -- her son, her elderly parents and a handful of old friends. She visits her hairdressers, consults with Hervé Pierre, her longtime stylist, and sometimes meets her husband for Friday night dinner at their clubs. But her most ardent pursuit is a personal campaign: helping her son, Barron, 17, with his college search.
What she has not done, despite invitations from her husband, is appear on the campaign trail. Nor has she been at his side for any of his court appearances.
These are the days of Melania Trump, former first lady, current campaign spouse and wife to one of the most divisive figures in American public life. Unlike her predecessors, there are no plans for a speaking tour, a book or a major expansion of her charitable efforts, most of which, people close to the Trumps say, are not fully visible to the public. In her post-presidential life, Mrs. Trump wants what she could not get in the White House: a sense of privacy.
Those efforts to retreat from public life have been complicated by her husband, who has turned her once again into a candidate's spouse. As Donald J. Trump faces a possible third indictment, she has remained steadfastly silent about his increasing legal peril.
While she supports his presidential bid, Mrs. Trump has not appeared on the trail since Mr. Trump announced his campaign in November and did not utter a public word about his effort until May, when she endorsed him in an interview with Fox News Digital.
"He has my support, and we look forward to restoring hope for the future and leading America with love and strength," she said.
Her absence is a striking difference from the start of the first Trump campaign, when Mrs. Trump, wearing a white strapless dress, descended the golden escalator in front of her husband at his campaign kickoff at Trump Tower.
Mrs. Trump remains in touch and friendly with a small group of people from her time in the White House, including the designer Rachel Roy and Hilary Geary Ross, the prominent Palm Beach networker and wife of Wilbur L. Ross, the president's former commerce secretary. She remains especially close with her parents, who have an apartment at Trump Tower in Manhattan and have been spotted at Trump events at Mar-a-Lago, the Trumps' private club and residence.
"From her point of view and her friends' point of view, she's been through a lot and she's come out a strong independent woman," said R. Couri Hay, a publicist, who was an acquaintance of Mrs. Trump's in New York before she headed to Washington. "She's learned how to close the door and close the shutters and remain private. We don't see a lot, we don't hear a lot."
Mrs. Trump declined an interview request. This account is based on a dozen interviews with associates, campaign aides and friends, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private details of her life.
People close to the family say Mrs. Trump's lack of public support should not be confused with disapproval or indifference. She remains defensive of her husband, sharing his belief that their family has been unfairly attacked. Deeply distrustful of the mainstream media, she is an avid reader of the Daily Mail online, tracking Mr. Trump's coverage in the conservative British tabloid.
Mrs. Trump is particularly skeptical of the case by E. Jean Carroll, who won $ 5 million in damages in a trial accusing Mr. Trump of sexual abuse in the 1990s and defamation after he left the White House, according to two people familiar with her remarks. When Mrs. Trump saw coverage of her husband's deposition in the case, she was livid at his legal team for failing to do more to raise objections. She has also privately questioned why Ms. Carroll could not recall the precise date of the alleged assault.
Still, Mrs. Trump believes that despite the legal peril, Mr. Trump could return to the White House next year. In private, she has expressed curiosity about Casey DeSantis, the wife of Mr. Trump's chief rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. Ms. DeSantis is a close adviser to her husband and a regular presence at his events, and she has begun to campaign for him on her own. In one of her rare interviews, Mrs. Trump mused to Fox News about having a second chance at being first lady, saying she would "prioritize the well-being and development of children" if she reprised the role.
But she has not yet prioritized campaigning. Although she has expressed willingness to do events for her husband next year, she has so far refused his requests to join him on the stump.
"I don't think it's going to be anything like what we've seen with Casey DeSantis," said Stephanie Grisham, a former Trump aide who quit on Jan. 6. "She's not going to be throwing on jeans and walking in parades."
Kellyanne Conway, a longtime Trump adviser who is also close with Mrs. Trump, said the former first lady was "all in" on her husband's candidacy and remained his "most trusted and most transparent adviser." Both Trumps, she said, have privately discussed "priorities" for a second term.
"I know few people as comfortable in their skin as Melania Trump," said Ms. Conway, who is not working for the campaign. "She knows who she is and keeps her priorities in check. Melania keeps them guessing, and they keep guessing wrong."
That air of mystery extends to the gated communities of her husband's clubs. In Palm Beach, Mrs. Trump is not a part of the social circuit, said Lore Smith, a longtime Palm Beach real estate agent who is a frequent visitor to the club.
Unlike her modern predecessors, who attended barre or spinning classes, Mrs. Trump isn't seen at the fitness center and isn't known to have a trainer, according to other club regulars and former aides. She has long been a fan of days spent at the spa, but she is almost never spotted outside at the pool at either Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster, Mr. Trump's golf resort in New Jersey. Occasionally, she makes brief appearances at charity functions at Mar-a-Lago with her husband.
"They very much keep to themselves behind the confines of Mar-a-Lago," Ms. Smith said.
Mrs. Trump remains closely involved with Barron's education. He is enrolled in a private school in West Palm Beach and is beginning to look at colleges in New York.
Mrs. Trump is said to prefer the city to Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster. She has been spotted going to her hairdresser and entering and exiting Trump Tower, which she does through a special side entrance and a private elevator.
Outside the family residences, Mrs. Trump's public schedule has been limited. She has done a handful of events, including collecting $ 500,000 in fees last year from the Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative group that supports L.G.B.T. rights, and Fix California, an elections organization founded by Richard Grenell, a former senior Trump administration official. Mr. Grenell declined to comment on her appearance at the events.
In February 2022, Mrs. Trump started "Fostering the Future," a scholarship program for foster children aging out of the system. A person familiar with the program, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, would not offer details or disclose how many scholarships have been awarded, saying only that it was "more than two." No charity with the name Fostering the Future or Be Best is registered in Florida or New York.
Michael Weitzman, the first recipient of one of the scholarships, said he received the funding for four years at Oral Roberts University through a mentor, who knew a friend involved with the Trumps. "He asked if going to college was still a dream of mine," said Mr. Weitzman, who spent his childhood living in 12 foster homes. "He said that he might know somebody really rich who might want to pay for me to go."
He did not fill out any kind of application but a day after the mentor floated the idea, he received an email from Mrs. Trump's public relations team asking if he would participate in a Fox News interview with the former first lady, her first since leaving the White House. The scholarship was announced during the May 2022 interview, with Mr. Weitzman participating over Zoom. Mr. Weitzman, 26, said he had not had any interactions with Mrs. Trump since.
"I haven't met her in person. I wondered often if I would and would love to," he said. "I'm beyond grateful. There's no reason that anybody should have done this for me."
Mrs. Trump's aides declined to discuss the details of her campaign plans, her charitable and business ventures and her views on her husband's legal issues. Mr. Trump's campaign declined to comment.
In many ways, Mrs. Trump's post-White House life is an extension of her style as first lady.
From the start of her husband's term, when she didn't immediately move into the White House, Mrs. Trump often vacillated between two extremes: embracing her role or bucking all expectations associated with it.
One of her most memorable moments was made through a fashion statement. While returning from a visit to a Texas border town to meet detained migrant children, she wore a jacket emblazoned with the phrase, "I really don't care. Do U?"
Much of her White House experience was marked by what people close to her described as disappointment and betrayal from friends, aides and even members of the Trump family. At times, her relationships with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's daughter and son-in-law, were strained, according to former aides. Since then, her former press secretary, Ms. Grisham, and a former aide and friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, have written tell-all books depicting her as icy and disengaged from the role.
Those experiences pushed Mrs. Trump to retreat even further from the public, say people familiar with the family.
But that privacy may be hard to maintain under the scrutiny of a contested presidential primary and legal investigations.
Last week, Chris Christie criticized both Trumps for a $ 155,000 payment to Mrs. Trump from a super PAC aligned with her husband's campaign. A representative for the super PAC said that Mrs. Trump was hired in 2021 for "design consulting," including choosing tableware, arranging settings and picking floral arrangements.
"There's grifting and then there's Trump grifting," Mr. Christie, the former New Jersey governor and most outspoken Trump critic in the 2024 Republican primary field, wrote on Twitter. "Undisputed champs."
Most of her public profile, conducted largely through her social media accounts, is focused on selling a variety of digital trading cards. Her NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, include digital drawings of her eyes, a broad-brimmed hat worn during a state visit, White House Christmas ornaments and a blue rose intended to commemorate National Foster Care Month.
The majority of her tweets and Instagram posts directly promote the NFTs or a business called USA Memorabilia, which sells them. A day after Mr. Trump announced on his social media website Truth Social that he had received a target letter in the federal investigation into his efforts to thwart the transfer of power in 2020, Mrs. Trump's only public comment was an announcement of a new "Man on the Moon" NFT collection.
A portion of her proceeds is donated, though her aides would not provide details about the amount given or specify the charity.
While first ladies often capitalize on the attendant fame, Mrs. Trump's moneymaking venture is different from those of her predecessors, said Kate Andersen Brower, the author of "First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies."
Michelle Obama was reportedly paid more than $ 60 million in a joint book deal with her husband, as well as commanding hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches and signing a lucrative production deal with Netflix. Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton also sold their memoirs for millions. Their memoirs and paid speeches required the former first ladies to share some details about themselves, their views and their lives in the White House.
By simply selling images, Mrs. Trump reveals nothing.
That's exactly how she likes it, Ms. Brower said.
"She's the most obviously unknowable first lady," she said of Mrs. Trump's public persona. "There's something radical about it. First ladies are expected to want to please people and I'm not sure she really cares."

Since leaving the White House, Melania Trump’s world has gotten smaller.
Just how she likes it.
Cloistered behind the gates of her three homes, she sticks to a small circle — her son, her elderly parents and a handful of old friends. She visits her hairdressers, consults with Hervé Pierre, her longtime stylist, and sometimes meets her husband for Friday night dinner at their clubs. But her most ardent pursuit is a personal campaign: helping her son, Barron, 17, with his college search.
What she has not done, despite invitations from her husband, is appear on the campaign trail. Nor has she been at his side for any of his court appearances.
These are the days of Melania Trump, former first lady, current campaign spouse and wife to one of the most divisive figures in American public life. Unlike her predecessors, there are no plans for a speaking tour, a book or a major expansion of her charitable efforts, most of which, people close to the Trumps say, are not fully visible to the public. In her post-presidential life, she wants what she could not get in the White House: a sense of privacy.
Those efforts to retreat from public life have been complicated by her husband, who has turned her once again into a candidate’s spouse. As Donald Trump faces a possible third indictment, she has remained steadfastly silent about his increasing legal peril.
While she supports his presidential bid, Melania Trump has not appeared on the trail since Trump announced his campaign in November and did not utter a public word about his effort until May, when she endorsed him in an interview with Fox News Digital.
“He has my support, and we look forward to restoring hope for the future and leading America with love and strength,” she said.
Her absence is a striking difference from the start of the first Trump campaign, when Melania Trump, wearing a white strapless dress, descended the golden escalator in front of her husband at his campaign kickoff at Trump Tower.
Melania Trump remains in touch and friendly with a small group of people from her time in the White House, including the designer Rachel Roy and Hilary Geary Ross, the prominent Palm Beach networker and wife of Wilbur L. Ross, Trump’s former commerce secretary. She remains especially close with her parents, who have an apartment at Trump Tower in Manhattan and have been spotted at Trump events at Mar-a-Lago, the Trumps’ private club and residence.
“From her point of view and her friends’ point of view, she’s been through a lot and she’s come out a strong independent woman,” said R. Couri Hay, a publicist, who was an acquaintance of Melania Trump’s in New York before she headed to Washington. “She’s learned how to close the door and close the shutters and remain private. We don’t see a lot, we don’t hear a lot.”
Melania Trump declined an interview request. This account is based on a dozen interviews with associates, campaign aides and friends, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private details of her life.
People close to the family say Melania Trump’s lack of public support should not be confused with disapproval or indifference. She remains defensive of her husband, sharing his belief that their family has been unfairly attacked. Deeply distrustful of the mainstream media, she is an avid reader of the Daily Mail online, tracking Trump’s coverage in the conservative British tabloid.
Melania Trump is particularly skeptical of the case by E. Jean Carroll, who won $5 million in damages in a trial accusing Trump of sexual abuse in the 1990s and defamation after he left the White House, according to two people familiar with her remarks. When Melania Trump saw coverage of her husband’s deposition in the case, she was livid at his legal team for failing to do more to raise objections. She has also privately questioned why Carroll could not recall the precise date of the alleged assault.
Still, Melania Trump believes that despite the legal peril, Trump could return to the White House next year. In private, she has expressed curiosity about Casey DeSantis, the wife of Trump’s chief rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. Casey DeSantis is a close adviser to her husband and a regular presence at his events, and she has begun to campaign for him on her own. In one of her rare interviews, Melania Trump mused to Fox News about having a second chance at being first lady, saying she would “prioritize the well-being and development of children” if she reprised the role.
But she has not yet prioritized campaigning. Although she has expressed willingness to do events for her husband next year, she has so far refused his requests to join him on the stump.
“I don’t think it’s going to be anything like what we’ve seen with Casey DeSantis,” said Stephanie Grisham, a former Trump aide who quit on Jan. 6. “She’s not going to be throwing on jeans and walking in parades.”
Kellyanne Conway, a longtime Trump adviser who is also close with Melania Trump, said the former first lady was “all in” on her husband’s candidacy and remained his “most trusted and most transparent adviser.” Both Trumps, she said, have privately discussed “priorities” for a second term.
“I know few people as comfortable in their skin as Melania Trump,” said Conway, who is not working for the campaign. “She knows who she is and keeps her priorities in check. Melania keeps them guessing, and they keep guessing wrong.”
That air of mystery extends to the gated communities of her husband’s clubs. In Palm Beach, the former first lady is not a part of the social circuit, said Lore Smith, a longtime Palm Beach real estate agent who is a frequent visitor to the club.

Influencers Turn Down Thousands to Protect Hollywood Dreams: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite not being in the actors' union, many content creators are passing up deals to promote films or TV shows because they don't want to be barred from the guild or face online vitriol.
Deanna Giulietti is not in the actors' union, but she turned down $ 28,000 last week because of its strike.
Ms. Giulietti, a 29-year-old content creator with 1.8 million TikTok followers, had received an offer to promote the new season of Hulu's hit show "Only Murders in the Building."
But SAG-AFTRA, as the union is known, recently issued rules stating that any influencer who engages in promotion for one of the Hollywood studios the actors are striking against will be ineligible for membership. (Disney is the majority owner of Hulu.) That gave Ms. Giulietti, who also acts and aspires to one day join the union, reason enough to decline the offer from Influential, a marketing agency working with Hulu.
The union's rule is part of a variety of aggressive tactics that hit at a pivotal moment for Hollywood labor and shows its desire to assert itself in a new era and with a different, mostly younger wave of creative talent.
"I want to be in these Netflix shows, I want to be in the Hulu shows, but we're standing by the writers, we're standing by SAG," Ms. Giulietti said. "People write me off whenever I say I'm an influencer, and I'm like, 'No, I really feel I could be making the difference here."'
That difference comes at a cost. In addition to the Hulu deal, Ms. Giulietti recently declined a $ 5,000 offer from the app TodayTix to promote the Searchlight Pictures movie "Theater Camp." (Disney also owns Searchlight.) She said she was living at home with her parents in Cheshire, Conn., and putting off renting an apartment in New York City while she saw how the strike -- which, along with a writers' strike, could go on for months -- would affect her income.
Representatives for Searchlight and TodayTix did not respond to requests for comment. Hulu and Influential declined to comment.
The last time Hollywood's screen actors and writers went on strike, social media platforms and the $ 5 billion influencer industry didn't exist. The actors' union began admitting content creators in 2021 and still has only a small number of them, but questions have quickly emerged around how the union's dispute with the major Hollywood studios will affect popular internet personalities.
The union's message that content creators will be blocked from membership if they provide work or services for struck companies has sent many scrambling. A number of creators have pledged support for writers and actors and circulated "scab" lists of influencers who promote new releases or appear at related events. Others have been frustrated or confused by instructions from a union that doesn't protect them, and that some had never heard of.
SAG-AFTRA, which represents some 160,000 movie and television actors, approved a strike on July 13. The division with the studios is driven largely by concerns about compensation in the streaming era and artificial intelligence. They joined screenwriters, who walked off the job in May, the first dual shutdown since 1960. During the strike, actors are not able to engage in publicity efforts for their projects or appear at film festivals or events like Comic-Con.
Influencers have become crucial to the entertainment industry in recent years, especially during the pandemic, building buzz and promoting products. They post videos to hype new TV shows and movies, appear on red carpets and at events like the MTV Video Music Awards, and unbox products tied to film and television characters. Typically, as in the case with Ms. Giulietti, outside agencies hire creators on behalf of the studios.
Now those activities, besides limiting their career ambitions, could lead to internet backlash, with one nonunion influencer already posting an apology video for appearing at a recent Disney movie premiere. Others have posted promotional videos anyway, without backtracking or pulling the content. At least one creator posting from a recent premiere opted to turn off their TikTok comments, possibly to avoid potential criticism.
On the flip side, videos from creators about jobs and events that they rejected in solidarity with actors have racked up praise and views on TikTok.
"We don't have power to make decisions for the talent, but we will in this moment recommend not engaging with struck work or struck companies on paid or organic projects," said Victoria Bachan, president of Whalar Talent, a unit of a creator commerce company that works with more than 200 content creators. She added that young creators were also more apt to be supportive of unions and organized labor.
Still, Whitney Singleton, a 27-year-old with 1.2 million TikTok followers, has been frustrated by what is being asked of her. She had never heard of SAG-AFTRA until the past couple of weeks. Ms. Singleton, using the moniker @KeepUpRadio, has attracted fans by singing and rapping about her favorite video games like Fortnite and streaming herself playing video games. It has been her full-time job for three years. She has collaborated with struck companies like Amazon in the past.
"I really do value creators, and I want them to get what they deserve," Ms. Singleton said. "But it's really hard for me to just be finding out about an organization and being expected to fall in line with their initiative when I feel like it's new to me and the influencer space."
She said some influencers were being asked to turn down five-figure deals, and that "the majority of creators I've talked to about it feel it's unfair that as nonunion members, they're being included in this conversation."
Ms. Singleton was invited to an early screening of the "Barbie" movie and said that while it wasn't a paid promotion, the union's guidelines for promoting the movie were "what I would deem murky." Ultimately, she decided to post about the event, for which she dyed her hair pink.
"I actually got no negative feedback, it was all positive," she said. "For a moment, I felt a bit scared and put in a corner with these requirements because I respect creators in all industries, but I wouldn't be being true to my heart if I had let those things stop me from living my life and sharing the content."
The union did not respond to questions about the criticism or about how many influencers are included in its membership. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which negotiates on behalf of the biggest studios, has said its offers to the writers and the actors were "historic" improvements on their previous contracts.
The reality for many creators is that they dream of someday achieving a level of fame beyond the smartphone screen, making the threat of blacklisting by Hollywood's most powerful union an ominous one.
Mario Mirante, a 28-year-old comedian on TikTok with 3.6 million followers, recently posted a popular video about turning down a deal to promote a show based on his support for actors and writers and his long-term ambitions. Mr. Mirante has hoped to work in Hollywood since childhood, and even has a tattoo of Jim Carrey as "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" on his arm.
"That's a lot of influencers' goal and aspiration and why they do it," said Mr. Mirante, who lives in Las Vegas. "We love to entertain and express ourselves, and that's the Super Bowl, that's the ultimate, being in a movie or a TV show."
Mr. Mirante has previously been paid to promote the movie "Champions" starring Woody Harrelson and a product tied to the "Guardians of the Galaxy" franchise.
"If I were to help the big studios amid this, I'm just hurting myself in the future, if that makes any sense," he said. "Of course I'm not a part of it right now, but they're fighting for basic rights, livable wages, not to have their A.I. likeness taken."
Krishna Subramanian, a founder of the influencer marketing firm Captiv8, said studios might need to pivot away from creators during the strike and get agencies to make more traditional display ads to place on Facebook and other sites.
Simone Umba is a TikTok creator with more than 300,000 followers who primarily posts about TV shows and movies but has paused making such videos. She said that many influencers felt that they were "stuck in the middle," but that most were opting to side with the union even as invitations and deals piled up.
"We knew we were going to get approached, and it's like we're in a really messy family feud," Ms. Umba, 26, said.
She added, "Regardless of if you want to join the union or not, you don't want to be one of those people that was willing to take a check instead of standing in support of people fighting for actual livable wages."
Ms. Umba said that it had been painful to miss out on posting about the star-studded "Barbie" movie after this summer's marketing bonanza and that she had declined to attend an early screening of the film in Atlanta. She and a friend were messaging recently after trailers for "The Marvels" dropped, agonizing over their inability to post.
"We were texting each other back and forth, like, this is so hard," she said. She said she was prepared to hold out for months but was already thinking of holiday releases. She crossed her fingers, held them up and said, "Please, please, don't let it get to Christmas."

Deanna Giulietti is not in the actors’ union, but she turned down $28,000 last week because of its strike.
Giulietti, a 29-year-old content creator with 1.8 million TikTok followers, had received an offer to promote the new season of Hulu’s hit show “Only Murders in the Building.”
But SAG-AFTRA, as the union is known, recently issued rules stating that any influencer who engages in promotion for one of the Hollywood studios the actors are striking against will be ineligible for membership. (The Walt Disney Co. is the majority owner of Hulu.) That gave Giulietti, who also acts and aspires to one day join the union, reason enough to decline the offer from Influential, a marketing agency working with Hulu.
The union’s rule is part of a variety of aggressive tactics that hit at a pivotal moment for Hollywood labor and shows its desire to assert itself in a new era and with a different, mostly younger wave of creative talent.
“I want to be in these Netflix shows, I want to be in the Hulu shows, but we’re standing by the writers, we’re standing by SAG,” Giulietti said. “People write me off whenever I say I’m an influencer, and I’m like, ‘No, I really feel I could be making the difference here.’ ”
That difference comes at a cost. In addition to the Hulu deal, Giulietti recently declined a $5,000 offer from the app TodayTix to promote the Searchlight Pictures movie “Theater Camp.” (Disney also owns Searchlight.) She said she was living at home with her parents in Cheshire, Connecticut, and putting off renting an apartment in New York City while she saw how the strike — which, along with a writers’ strike, could go on for months — would affect her income.
Representatives for Searchlight and TodayTix did not respond to requests for comment. Hulu and Influential declined to comment.
The last time Hollywood’s screen actors and writers went on strike, social media platforms and the $5 billion influencer industry did not exist. The actors’ union began admitting content creators in 2021 and still has only a small number of them, but questions have quickly emerged around how the union’s dispute with the major Hollywood studios will affect popular internet personalities.
The union’s message that content creators will be blocked from membership if they provide work or services for struck companies has sent many scrambling. A number of creators have pledged support for writers and actors and circulated “scab” lists of influencers who promote new releases or appear at related events. Others have been frustrated or confused by instructions from a union that does not protect them, and that some had never heard of.
SAG-AFTRA, which represents some 160,000 movie and television actors, approved a strike on July 13. The division with the studios is driven largely by concerns about compensation in the streaming era and artificial intelligence. They joined screenwriters, who walked off the job in May, the first dual shutdown since 1960. During the strike, actors are not able to engage in publicity efforts for their projects or appear at film festivals or events such as Comic-Con.
Influencers have become crucial to the entertainment industry in recent years, especially during the pandemic, building buzz and promoting products. They post videos to hype new TV shows and movies, appear on red carpets and at events such as the MTV Video Music Awards, and unbox products tied to film and television characters. Typically, as in the case with Giulietti, outside agencies hire creators on behalf of the studios.
Now those activities, besides limiting their career ambitions, could lead to internet backlash, with one nonunion influencer posting an apology video for appearing at a recent Disney movie premiere. Others have posted promotional videos anyway, without backtracking or pulling the content. At least one creator posting from a recent premiere opted to turn off their TikTok comments, possibly to avoid potential criticism.
On the flip side, videos from creators about jobs and events that they rejected in solidarity with actors have racked up praise and views on TikTok.
“We don’t have power to make decisions for the talent, but we will in this moment recommend not engaging with struck work or struck companies on paid or organic projects,” said Victoria Bachan, president of Whalar Talent, a unit of a creator commerce company that works with more than 200 content creators. She added that young creators were also more apt to be supportive of unions and organized labor.
Still, Whitney Singleton, a 27-year-old with 1.2 million TikTok followers, has been frustrated by what is being asked of her. She had never heard of SAG-AFTRA until the past couple of weeks. Singleton, using the moniker @KeepUpRadio, has attracted fans by singing and rapping about her favorite video games including Fortnite and streaming herself playing video games. It has been her full-time job for three years. She has collaborated with struck companies such as Amazon in the past.
“I really do value creators, and I want them to get what they deserve,” Singleton said. “But it’s really hard for me to just be finding out about an organization and being expected to fall in line with their initiative when I feel like it’s new to me and the influencer space.”
She said some influencers were being asked to turn down five-figure deals, and that “the majority of creators I’ve talked to about it feel it’s unfair that as nonunion members, they’re being included in this conversation.”
Singleton was invited to an early screening of the “Barbie” movie and said that though it was not a paid promotion, the union’s guidelines for promoting the movie were “what I would deem murky.” Ultimately, she decided to post about the event, for which she dyed her hair pink.
“I actually got no negative feedback, it was all positive,” she said. “For a moment, I felt a bit scared and put in a corner with these requirements because I respect creators in all industries, but I wouldn’t be being true to my heart if I had let those things stop me from living my life and sharing the content.”
The union did not respond to questions about the criticism or about how many influencers are included in its membership. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which negotiates on behalf of the biggest studios, has said its offers to writers and actors were “historic” improvements on their previous contracts.
The reality for many creators is that they dream of someday achieving a level of fame beyond the smartphone screen, making the threat of blacklisting by Hollywood’s most powerful union an ominous one.
Mario Mirante, a 28-year-old comedian on TikTok with 3.6 million followers, recently posted a popular video about turning down a deal to promote a show based on his support for actors and writers and his long-term ambitions. Mirante has hoped to work in Hollywood since childhood, and even has a tattoo of Jim Carrey as “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” on his arm.
“That’s a lot of influencers’ goal and aspiration and why they do it,” said Mirante, who lives in Las Vegas. “We love to entertain and express ourselves, and that’s the Super Bowl, that’s the ultimate, being in a movie or a TV show.”
Mirante has previously been paid to promote the movie “Champions” starring Woody Harrelson and a product tied to the “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise.
“If I were to help the big studios amid this, I’m just hurting myself in the future, if that makes any sense,” he said. “Of course I’m not a part of it right now, but they’re fighting for basic rights, livable wages, not to have their AI likeness taken.”
Krishna Subramanian, a founder of the influencer marketing firm Captiv8, said studios might need to pivot away from creators during the strike and get agencies to make more traditional display ads to place on Facebook and other sites.
Simone Umba is a TikTok creator with more than 300,000 followers who primarily posts about TV shows and movies but has paused making such videos. She said that many influencers thought that they were “stuck in the middle,” but that most were opting to side with the union even as invitations and deals piled up.
“We knew we were going to get approached, and it’s like we’re in a really messy family feud,” Umba, 26, said.
She added, “Regardless of if you want to join the union or not, you don’t want to be one of those people that was willing to take a check instead of standing in support of people fighting for actual livable wages.”
Umba said that it had been painful to miss out on posting about the star-studded “Barbie” movie after this summer’s marketing bonanza and that she had declined to attend an early screening of the film in Atlanta. She and a friend were messaging recently after trailers for “The Marvels” were released, agonizing over their inability to post.
“We were texting each other back and forth, like, this is so hard,” she said. She said she was prepared to hold out for months but was already thinking of holiday releases. She crossed her fingers, held them up and said, “Please, please, don’t let it get to Christmas.”

Hollywood's Tireless Secret Weapon: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Inside the studio of the costume master who helped give the world "Klute," "The English Patient," "Midnight Cowboy," "Working Girl," "Mamma Mia!" "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" -- and more.
Ann Roth began with a few instructions: "Do NOT call me amazing. Do NOT call me a 91-year-old legend. Do NOT call me the oldest person in the 'Barbie' movie."
I had driven four hours through a biblical downpour to interview the revered costume designer. After a hike down a dark path through the woods to an 18th-century house, I felt as though I were opening the Narnia wardrobe and entering a whimsical fantasy world. Owls perched on rafters. Angels from Naples, Italy, dangled from the bedroom ceiling and chandeliers. A stone mantel was lined with miniature farm animals amid Oscars, Tonys and BAFTAs.
The enchanted cottage is a portal to one of the most imaginative minds in American culture, who has conjured memorable theater and film characters for more than half a century, from "The World of Henry Orient" to "The World According to Garp," from "Midnight Cowboy" to "The Morning After."
Ms. Roth was dressed in a crisp blue Orvis shirt, flowered shorts, rubber sandals (with aquamarine toenails peeking out) and an anklet that reads "East Coast" in an Old English typeface, a present from her grandchildren. She sports rings for earrings, including her grandmother's engagement diamond.
Ms. Roth has a pivotal scene with Margot Robbie in the "Barbie" movie, directed by her friend Greta Gerwig (Ms. Roth calls her "Gret"). When it was floated that Ms. Gerwig cut the scene, she refused, she said, because without it, "I don't know what this movie is about."
When the forever-young Barbie ventures out from Barbieland and encounters Ms. Roth, who plays a woman sitting at a bus stop in Los Angeles reading a paper, the doll suddenly realizes that being human and growing old could be cool.
"You're so beautiful," Barbie tells the woman, sounding amazed.
"I know it," Ms. Roth, in character, replies blithely.
Asked about the blizzard of pink that has enveloped the nation, Ms. Roth replied: "I live in Pennsylvania. I haven't seen pink in a long time." She is not going to a fancy "Barbie" premiere. She's going to see the movie this weekend at a theater on Route 248 in eastern Pennsylvania.
The designer has been the trusted collaborator of -- and provocateur for -- a pantheon of top directors, including Mike Nichols, Nora Ephron, Steven Spielberg, Anthony Minghella, John Schlesinger, Brian De Palma, George Roy Hill, Hal Ashby, Joe Mantello, Jack O'Brien, M. Night Shyamalan, Stephen Daldry, James Brooks and, early in her career, Dino De Laurentiis.
"She rides shotgun with you," said Mr. O'Brien, the Broadway director.
Ms. Roth points out a bedroom where her close friend Meryl Streep stays when she visits. She has conjured Ms. Streep's look in 13 movies, including "Silkwood," "Heartburn," "Postcards From the Edge," "Doubt," "Julie & Julia," "The Post" and "Mamma Mia!" as well as the mini-series "Angels in America." She calls her "Melstrip," echoing the way she heard the name pronounced in Italy.
She is planning a road trip in Italy with Melstrip if she can find the right shoes to ease her knee pain.
Jesus Christ by Way of Cheryl Tiegs
Ms. Roth is of Quaker stock. She grew up in Pennsylvania Dutch country, where she wore a long strand of pearls to her job as a teenager at the five-and-ten. After graduating in the class of '53 at Carnegie Mellon, she apprenticed with the celebrated costume designer Irene Sharaff, working on "Brigadoon" (dyeing the men's tartans), Judy Garland's "A Star Is Born," and "The King and I."
Ms. Sharaff warned her protégée not to pursue her dream of becoming a production designer, saying, according to Ms. Roth, "it's not the place for women."
Mr. O'Brien said he knew that Ms. Roth was a force to be reckoned with back in 1970, when they worked on a production of "The Importance of Being Earnest" and she suggested adorning Miss Prism, Oscar Wilde's strict spinster governess, with little scissors around her waist. "So she can go snip, snip, snip, at people's balls," Mr. O'Brien said with a laugh.
Ms. Roth was doing Off Broadway shows, stealing costumes from garbage cans, when she got her Hollywood break. Zooming around Los Angeles in her white 1946 MG convertible, she started with a splash, creating the fantastic look for the 1964 Peter Sellers comedy "The World of Henry Orient." In it, an affluent Manhattan teenager named Valerie Boyd telegraphs her loneliness by draping her neglectful mother's long mink coat over her plaid school uniform; Mr. Sellers's Casanova concert pianist is bedecked in monogrammed handmade yellow silk pajamas. "Do you think I'd make polyester for anyone?" Ms. Roth said with a laugh.
Since then, Ms. Roth has created innumerable iconic looks for Broadway and Hollywood: Dustin Hoffman's purple suit and Jon Voight's fringed suede jacket in "Midnight Cowboy"; Jane Fonda's sequined cocktail dress and boa as a call girl in "Klute"; Barbra Streisand's nightie with the satin-appliqué hands cupping her breasts and "heart on her pee-pee," as Ms. Roth put it, in "The Owl and the Pussycat." She's the person who put Natalie Portman in a $ 19 pink wig for "Closer."
Then there's the Jesus character in "The Book of Mormon," who had lights attached to his cape to give him a sacred glow. "I wanted Cheryl Tiegs in the '80s," Ms. Roth said of the look, harking back to the beatific, blond pictures of Jesus I grew up with.
As costume designer for the notorious film flop "The Bonfire of the Vanities," Ms. Roth "resembled an elegant pheasant on amphetamines," Julie Salamon wrote in her rollicking 1991 book, "The Devil's Candy."
The pheasant and I sat down to a delicious lunch of salmon, corn salad, homemade vanilla ice cream and red wine. Then we repaired to her cozy studio, rain pattering on the skylights, to look at all her sketches, photos and voluminous research books. The room is dominated by a large, beautiful Brigitte Lacombe photo of Ms. Streep, a smaller one of a smiling Mr. Nichols ("I really, really miss Mike") and a photo of Ms. Streisand wearing that racy negligee.
"What do you think it took to get little Barb into that?" Ms. Roth said drolly about La Streisand. "I don't think she thought it was hip or would make the pages of Vogue. It's hard to get actors to go for trash. Trash is one of my favorite things to do."
In the middle of the room, there's a chaise with a leopard-print throw, perfect for getting inspiration as she plays Mozart, Beethoven, Strauss, Offenbach, Elvis and Fats Domino. In a corner is a MacBook still in the box.
"I've never opened it," she said. "I don't have a website. I've never seen Instagram or TikTok." She adds, "I'm way oldie-timey."
Her friends would laugh at that description of a woman with boundless energy who shows up at parties with her karaoke machine. "She's younger than any young artist I know," said her close friend Scott Rudin. "She's been on top of her game for 65 years."
Ms. Roth is going through 2,000 drawings of her costumes, which she plans to donate to Carnegie Mellon when she dies. She showed me some of the famous ones, complete with swatches of material attached. "Usually, they have a wine glass circle on them," she said, "because I'm talking with the tailor late at night."
(Most of the time, she calls me "darling girl," but if I ask a question she deems stupid, she calls me "birdbrain.")
Ms. Roth's warehouse a few miles away has enough clothes to outfit a city, chockablock with pieces from every decade -- waist cinchers and fedoras and century-old football shoulder pads, and categories like "Nazis," "Israeli police," "Mambo kings" and "Jesus Christ, multiples."
The designer had a symbiotic relationship with Mr. Nichols for nearly 50 years. She did six plays with him, starting with Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" in 1965, and 13 films, including "Silkwood," "Heartburn," "The Birdcage" and "Working Girl."
The director usually took Ms. Roth's advice -- except on one thing. "He had a terrible problem with printed fabrics," she said. "Mike would say, 'You can't have plaid. Ever."'
"'Let's just try it. If you hate it, I'll pay for it,"' Ms. Roth recalled saying to him. "That always gets them."
Mr. Spielberg was more docile. He said that when he first met Ms. Roth, she did a presentation on how she would dress Ms. Streep and Tom Hanks as Katharine Graham and Ben Bradlee for "The Post," and he was smart enough to keep his mouth shut. "I said, 'Yes, boss,"' he recalled.
Attention to Detail
When Ms. Roth won the Academy Award for best costume design in 2021 for "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," she was hailed as the oldest woman to ever win a competitive Oscar. It followed her win for "The English Patient" in 1997 -- remember the amazing red plaid shawl Kristin Scott Thomas wore to keep warm in the desert nights? -- and a Tony in 2013 for "The Nance."
For "Ma Rainey," Ms. Roth said, "I made the behind." She endowed Viola Davis with greater curves -- rubber boobs underneath her boobs, as Ms. Roth put it, and a rubber bottom to match the measurements of Aretha Franklin, at Ms. Davis's request.
The actors wore authentically heavy wool suits in a steamy Chicago summer "because it needed to hang correctly," said the film's director, George Wolfe. Ms. Roth said she imports 21-ounce wool from West Yorkshire, England, for period pieces, noting that "wool has to be what it is supposed to be."
"Things either enhance or distract," Mr. Wolfe said. "Actors feel and sense and are affected by everything. They're affected by what their undergarment is, what the wig is. It's all contributing to the storytelling or it's distracting from the storytelling. That's what's so thrilling to work with Ann, because she brings the ferocity of that belief in every single detail of her work."
Unlike costume designers in Hollywood's heyday, Ms. Roth is not devoted to making the top movie stars look impossibly glamorous. She talked Nicole Kidman into wearing a big latex nose to play Virginia Woolf in "The Hours" in 2002. "I said to her, 'I can't honestly put a 1917 hat on your head with that nose,"' she recalled. "I made her a nose with a nose maker in England, and it took hours every morning for them to get the damn thing on."
Mr. Rudin, the film's producer, backed up Ms. Roth, but Harvey Weinstein, who was financing the movie, was furious. "'I paid a million dollars for that girl, and no one knows who she is,"' Ms. Roth recalled Mr. Weinstein snapping. Mr. Rudin said that Mr. Weinstein sent an executive to London to talk Ms. Kidman out of the nose, but Mr. Rudin stationed security guards at every entrance of the set so that Mr. Weinstein's man could not get to the actress. Ms. Kidman won an Oscar for her transformation.
"I don't think anybody really liked him," Ms. Roth murmured about Mr. Weinstein.
Ms. Roth conceived Melanie Griffith's metamorphosis from Staten Island secretary to Wall Street wiz in "Working Girl." ("You can't talk about the movie without talking about cocaine," she told Mark Harris for his biography on Mr. Nichols.)
On "The Bonfire of the Vanities," which also starred Ms. Griffith, the director, Mr. De Palma, had conferences with actresses on his lap, and the crew openly rated the actress's "heinies" and legs and complained if they were a few pounds overweight, according to Ms. Salamon's book.
"I've never seen so many prosthetic breasts in my life," Ms. Roth told Ms. Salamon, after days of fitting extras for the movie.
Asked about the quote, Ms. Roth smiled sweetly. "A girl has to be careful what she says, doesn't she?" she replied.
The costume designer is famously blunt. She hates whiners and loves a challenge.
"She tells you the truth, tells you when you've made a mistake, straight up, no B.S., and you trust her because of it," said Amy Pascal, the producer who worked with Ms. Roth on "The Post."
Ms. Roth performs her alchemy at the moment when actors feel most vulnerable: costume fittings when they're in their underwear, looking in the mirror and just beginning to search for their characters. She is like a psychoanalyst, managing their insecurities to help them subsume themselves in a character.
She said her technique is to gather all kinds of stuff and stick it in the closet of the fitting room. "Then I say to them, 'You and I are going to find this character,"' she said. "But I, in all honesty, am not going to consult. It's too late to consult because I've already got it behind the curtains in the closet.
"Someone said to me, 'I don't wear yellow,"' she recalled. "I said, 'Shut up."' Eventually, the actors' characters stare back at them in the mirror.
Sometimes Ms. Roth changes lives. She advised one uptight movie star to smoke marijuana to relax, and warned Mr. Shyamalan, when they worked on "Signs" and "The Village," not to let money and success corrupt him.
"She was playing through life like a child and that's contagious," Mr. Shyamalan said.
A 'Novelist Designer'
Ms. Roth's curiosity about everyone, whether she meets them at a gas station or a gala, is her most distinctive trait.
Ms. Streep calls her "a novelist designer."
"In her work in film and theater, she is a sort of writer," Ms. Streep said of her friend. "Her designs are not so much costumes as an extension of the individual character she is building with an actor and director. You don't come away from her work saying, 'Oh, weren't the costumes gorgeous?' You just remember the people she has clarified for you through what they chose to put on their bodies in the morning. She has a sharp flair for the eccentric in the ordinary. Authenticity and specificity."
Ms. Roth scorns the slipshod. She searched for just the right shade of blue for Bette Midler's caftan in her 2013 one-woman play "I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers."
Ms. Midler said: "Usually these days you get 'It sort of fits.' 'It's fine, the camera won't see your feet."'
"I hate the expression 'I see you,"' the actress said. "But Ann sees you and sees the character on top of you."
Ms. Roth has been known to go to extremes to get the look she wants. While shooting the 2012 action movie "Safe," she asked a Polish construction worker in Philadelphia for his pants to put on Jason Statham, according to "The Designs of Ann Roth," by Holly Poe Durbin and Bonnie Kruger.
"They were old and sexy," Ms. Roth told me. (She bought the pantsed man another pair.)
She is particularly proud of buying a red fox fur coat from a parking attendant at 25th and 10th in Manhattan that Brenda Vaccaro, nervous about being naked, ended up wearing during her sex scene with Mr. Voight in "Midnight Cowboy." The designer kept it to wear herself afterward.
During the costume fitting for "Mamma Mia!" Ms. Roth told Christine Baranski about Tanya, her jet-setting character: Her lifestyle was "Dolce & Gabbana Vita," and she vacationed in Sardinia, Italy, and Ibiza, Spain.
"Ann said Tanya was always pursuing the next fabulous thing and the next fabulous guy, but there was a bit of desperation there," Ms. Baranski recalled.
Ms. Roth worked with a nervous Nathan Lane on Noël Coward's "Present Laughter" on Broadway in 1982. In the play, he's an aspiring playwright whose father wants him to be a lawyer. Ms. Roth put a vintage brown suit on him while explaining, "This suit was probably owned by your father, who's a lawyer. He wanted you to become a lawyer and the suit was cut down for you." (Mr. Lane called her "the Meryl Streep of costume designers.")
James Brooks, who produced "Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret," released earlier this year, was dumbfounded when he heard Ms. Roth, who was overseeing costumes, hair and makeup, talk to the actors as she fitted them. He began sitting with her.
"It would be pleasure seeking to just sit and listen to it," he said. "It was like every second, 100 times a day, she was saying something smart in that low, thrilling voice."
He has already enlisted her to work on his new movie being shot in Rhode Island, "Ella McKay," starring Emma Mackey, who is in "Barbie."
Historically Accurate Underwear
Ms. Roth upended the Hollywood system, informing the suits about dressing the bit players, "I will be doing the elevator man," she said.
In "Cold Mountain," she did not just dress Ms. Kidman and Renée Zellweger; she outfitted the entire Union and Confederate armies for the scene depicting the Battle of the Crater. She took someone with her to the set to age and dye the fabrics correctly; she can give a whole dissertation on the iron as an instrument to ingrain dirt around a collar.
We looked at the fabric swatch from the movie. In The Times, Kate Betts described the labyrinthine process of replicating the fabric of the North Carolina 25th Infantry, called butternut because it was dyed with the bark of a butternut tree. "So she tracked down someone named Pat Cline in Pennsylvania, who knew exactly how to dye the thread to look authentic," Ms. Betts wrote. "Ms. Roth had the fabric woven and printed in Montana, dyed and aged in Rome and shipped to Romania, where the filming took place."
Ms. Roth did the costumes for the smash Scott Rudin production of Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird," refashioned by Aaron Sorkin. She visited London last year to check on the costumes for the West End run.
After lining up the cast in the lobby of the theater, because the backstage stairs were too daunting, Ms. Roth asked the actors if anyone had some coins she could borrow. She dumped a load of coins into the suit pocket of one of the actors and said, "That's how a jacket that's been worn for years sags and sits and looks, and that's how I'd like all these coats and pants and jackets to hang, with the weight of time and wear."
She also insists on historically accurate underwear. For "Places in the Heart," a Depression-era story, she gave Sally Field a girdle without a crotch for Edna Spalding's going-into-town-to-ask-for-a-loan-at-the-bank look. When Ms. Field gave her a look, she told the actress, "Put it on." With the proper underwear, she explained, you walk and sit a certain way. The actress won an Oscar.
Most of the time, actors are grateful to soak up Ms. Roth's ideas. "Ann will hand me a purse to go with a particular costume and going through its contents will inevitably reveal things to me about my character," Ms. Fonda said. "Maybe there's a Swiss Army knife in the purse. Maybe a cigarette holder and lighter or a small notebook for journaling and a very specific kind of pen."
Speaking about her character in "9 to 5," Ms. Fonda recalled, "A purse she gave me for Judy Bernly had food coupons in it."
Joe Mantello said that for the Honey character in his 2020 production of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" Ms. Roth had a second A-line shift made and put a small vomit stain on it and more wrinkles for the scene after Honey throws up.
"Unless you were in the three front rows and really observant, you would not notice that," Mr. Mantello said. "But detail and reality are so much a part of her process. And it really helps the actor because they move in a different way when they wear it. That's what makes Ann Roth Ann Roth.
"She and Mike Nichols were like-minded collaborators because he allowed behavior to reveal psychology and she allows clothes to reveal psychology."
Sometimes, however, movie stars cling to their image and fight Ms. Roth. Mr. Hoffman, a newly minted movie star after "The Graduate," at first resisted Ratso Rizzo's look in "Midnight Cowboy," a green suit Ms. Roth found on 42nd Street and dyed purple, and a white jacket redolent of Ratso's pathetic emulation of the Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni. She added Times Square "cockroach-in-the-corner" high-tops.
In "Primary Colors," John Travolta, playing Jack Stanton (based mostly on Bill Clinton in the 1992 campaign), did not want to wear what Ms. Roth had accurately planned: "Department-store suits available to men in a small city in a not-prominent Southern state."
"I lost that battle," Ms. Roth said with a rueful grin, noting that the actor must have gone to Mr. Nichols, the director, and said, "She's making me wear this ugly suit." Mr. Nichols told Ms. Roth, "Let him have Donna Karan suits."
"I will never forgive Mike for that," she said, laughing.
Mr. Travolta's rejection of her look did not stop them from hanging out.
"I did go dancing with Travolta once," she said. "We danced once in a big makeup-hair camper and we said, 'We have to do this more' and we did. He's a very good jitterbug, as am I."
Before I left, I wondered which movie she considered her best work.
"It was probably Jude Law and Matt Damon in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,"' she said. "That was my fashion piece."
And which was the most fun?
"I have never had fun making a movie in my life except for 'Mamma Mia!' where some guy called me and said, 'How would you like to go to an island with your good friend and make 'Mamma Mia!'?" She got to hang out with Ms. Streep and Ms. Baranski and drink lots of martinis. "I drink potato-based vodka on ice," she said. "Not grain."
After all, as Ms. Roth said slyly, "I'm the world's oldest costume designer, damn it!"
Confirm or Deny
Maureen Dowd: You have been wearing blue toenail polish every day since 1953.
Ann Roth: Mike Nichols asked me to come to dinner with Anthony Minghella at the fancy Chinese restaurant in Beverly Hills, Mr Chow. Before Minghella arrived, Mike looked at my feet and said, "You're not going in like this, are you?"
You worked as an assistant for Miles White when he designed the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and was the costume designer for "Around the World in 80 Days." There were 74,685 costumes for that movie.
That was a big mess. I did go to Las Vegas to fit Marlene Dietrich. She wanted to sit on a big beer or wine barrel with her legs apart because Miles had done a divine drawing of her like that. I had to find the barrel. She was fabulous. She taught me about a fabric that was made in Czechoslovakia and found in Switzerland called silk souffle, which really doesn't exist anymore. It's just thinner than silk stockings ever dreamt of being. Cameramen sometimes liked to use it on their lenses because it made people look better.
You kept the gray sequined dress Jane Fonda's call girl wore to parade before a client in "Klute."
Jane and I passed that dress back and forth for about a year afterward. Jane is like four inches taller than I, and I would have mine pinned up and go to a party and then ship it back to her.
You often use a flesh-toned fabric known as O.M.D., describing the color of an older man's privates.
O.M.D. is a lavender gray. The Russian ladies who sewed for the costume designers Barbara Karinska and Irene Sharaff called that color thread O.M.D. They spoke no English at all except they all knew what O.M.D. was.
You love to wear snail spit to go out to cocktails.
I would. Snail spit is a novelty fabric, cheap, like nylon with a shine or glitter to it. You can pull a yard through a wedding ring. You can't pull a yard of velvet through a wedding ring.
You have your own karaoke machine.
I do, but I need it Thursday and I don't know where it is.

Macabre Fascination Draws Tourists to the Gilgo Beach Suspect's House: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On Long Island, the fascinated and obsessed come to gawk at the house where the suspect lived. Some bring the children.
Scarlett Fascetti approached the dilapidated red house as if it were a shrine.
"I couldn't wait to see it. I'm so into this thing," said Ms. Fascetti, 51, a teacher who had traveled 30 miles from her Long Island town to a section of Massapequa Park that has become an instant tourist attraction for a dark reason: It is the home of Rex Heuermann, the architect charged last week in the Gilgo Beach serial killings.
Ms. Fascetti could already reel off details about the killings and had quickly gotten up to speed on the three murder charges against Mr. Heuermann. She knew everything from precisely how 11 bodies had been found along Ocean Parkway to the vehicle Mr. Heuermann had in his driveway.
Mr. Heuermann, who is being held without bail at a Suffolk County jail, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he met women who were working as escorts, then killed them and wrapped them in burlap to bury them along a stretch of barrier island on the South Shore.
Since his arrest on July 13, hundreds of wide-eyed people from across Long Island and beyond have come each day to the home, about five miles from Gilgo Beach, where Mr. Heuermann lived with his wife and two grown children. They have clustered outside police tape on the edge of his block.
The site on the otherwise unremarkable corner of First and Michigan Avenues in this sleepy bedroom community allows a vantage into the red house, a crime scene that for days has been searched by investigators, while Mr. Heuermann's family has not been seen at home. His wife, Asa Ellerup, has filed for divorce, her lawyer, Robert A. Macedonio, confirmed on Wednesday.
Some bike over or walk the dog from nearby blocks; some trek from distant towns or other states. Once-near-empty streets are lined with cars from sunup to sundown, parked by true-crime addicts, serial killer aficionados and some people obsessed specifically with the Gilgo Beach murders.
"It's part of history," said Lidia Feldman, 26, who lives several towns away. Her 2-year-old daughter cheerfully rode her plastic toy car into the yellow crime-scene tape.
"It sends chills down your spine," said Ms. Feldman.
Some couldn't care less about Gilgo Beach, the red house or the arsenal of guns being carried out of it by investigators in white jumpsuits. One group of women showed up Tuesday evening to announce they were there only to meet police officers to date.
This offer was met with a mix of grins and stern stares from a phalanx of officers standing sentry.
Some parents viewed the house as an educational site. Mayra Urema of Farmingdale brought her daughter Veronica Medina, 14, because, she said, "I wanted to teach my daughter that there's scary people in this world."
As for herself, Ms. Urema said. "I've been following this story since Day 1."'
She stared past the crime scene tape and murmured, "I'd love to go inside there, just to see."
Onlookers seemed both horrified and fascinated.
"Coming here makes it real for me," said Lori Gargiulo, who mentioned her own coincidental connections to notorious crimes. The serial killer Joel Rifkin was a classmate at East Meadow High School, she said, and Colin Ferguson, who shot 25 people, six fatally, on a Long Island Rail Road train in 1993, was a co-worker at a burglar alarm company in Syosset.
For Michael Iavarone, of Huntington, visiting this neighborhood of modest, well-kept houses in neat rows drove home the idea that "this guy was living amongst the people."
Mr. Iavarone, a co-owner of the champion racehorse Big Brown and a surpassingly flashy internet personality, looked toward the red house, absorbed in watching investigators cart out evidence.
"I feel horrible for the neighbors," he said. "It's become a tourist spot."
Marianne Patino, 59, who lives in Babylon, likened the Heuermann house to the Dutch colonial two miles away made famous by the "Amityville Horror" films, which were based on the true story of a young man who killed six members of his family in 1974.
"This will be the next 'Amityville Horror house,' it will stay in history," she said -- a prospect dreaded by neighbors. Decades after the Amityville crimes, gawkers still drive by and take photos, to the consternation of the current owners.
On Tuesday, a reporter who visited the original Amityville house was met by a woman on a balcony who shouted, "private property!"
Nick Marsi and Jake Goodhart, both 18-year-olds from Hauppauge, had parked in front of the house to chat about the films. They enjoy exploring serial killer points of interest, they said.
The young men said they were unaware of the Gilgo Beach slayings, but were amazed to learn that the suspect lived only two miles away.
"Sounds awesome," Mr. Marsi said.
They drove off.
Back at the Massapequa Park house, Bernadette Paredes, 53, an office manager from Levittown, had brought her 18-year-old daughter, Brooke, who had watched a Netflix movie, "Lost Girls," based on the Gilgo Beach case.
"It was just weird to watch it and come here and see it in real life," Brooke Paredes said. "It's creepy."
Her mother took photographs for Facebook.
"I guess now I'm cool," she said. "I got to see Rex's house."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Peacock's new show indulges in the same ultraviolence as the video game that inspired it. But this time it has a message about the haves and the have-nots.
When Stephanie Beatriz likes a script she enjoys reading it aloud at home to get a better feel for the character and story. She warmed up quickly to "Twisted Metal," the new Peacock mayhem machine based on the popular PlayStation game series that first burned rubber in 1995. But as she turned the pages, encountering psycho clowns, murderous religious cults, cannibalism and other manner of good times, she had to pause. Her 8-month-old daughter was in the room.
In a June video interview she recalled what she told her husband: "I'm going to take a break and stop because I'm not sure that this is great for her subconscious."
Her concern was well-founded. Premiering July 27, "Twisted Metal" is nothing if not extreme. Fast and profane, it is fueled by what "A Clockwork Orange" once called a bit of the old ultraviolence. It is blood-soaked, bullet-ridden and chaotic. In one early scene, two men sit in massive tubs, waiting to be cooked and served. One of them is sprinkled with a generous portion of lemon pepper spice as a human foot dangles from a line; Ol' Dirty Bastard's "Shimmy Shimmy Ya" ("Ooh, baby, I like it raw") blares on the soundtrack.
Starring Anthony Mackie as John Doe, a wiz behind the wheel hired to deliver a mystery package across a hazardous, postapocalyptic America, and Beatriz as Quiet, his no-nonsense, vengeance-minded passenger, "Twisted Metal" stakes out a sometimes-queasy intersection between terror and glee. It's a little like "Mad Max" on laughing gas.
"It's a very weird apocalypse," Marc Forman, an executive producer, said. "It's crawling with cannibals and weird cults. What's great is that you never know what's around the corner."
There's very little that is old fashioned about "Twisted Metal," yet it has a fair amount of nostalgia in the tank -- for both the pre-apocalyptic world, and for an earlier age of gaming. The story is set in the wake of a hazily defined, world-destroying event that occurred in 2002, freezing culture as the characters know it in that year. An evil interrogator uses the late '90s Europop earworm "Barbie Girl" to torture his prisoners.
As Mackie's John drives his beat-up 2002 Subaru through a dilapidated shopping mall, he's excited to see the remnants of a Foot Locker (he grabs some kicks as he races by). A Twisted Metal game cartridge falls onto his windshield; he looks at it quizzically.
Mackie, 44, recalled playing the earliest versions of Twisted Metal. "I remember it just being destruction," he said in a June phone interview as he sat, ironically, in traffic. "The game was just demolition derby, and I loved it, but it was impossible to play. You couldn't control the cars -- you were just flying past each other, shooting missiles and hoping they hit."
The playing experience advanced, along with the rest of the gaming industry, through subsequent iterations. Now "Twisted Metal" is just the latest TV series hoping to translate gaming popularity to small-screen success, following in the footsteps of series like Netflix's "The Witcher" and HBO's abundantly Emmy-nominated hit "The Last of Us."
In gaming circles, "Twisted Metal" belongs to the genre of "vehicular combat." The game isn't big on narrative. The series's creative team, including the showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith and the writer-executive producers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (both writers on the "Deadpool" movies), were charged with expanding the game's world to the scale of a TV show -- to take it beyond, in Mackie's words, "just being destruction." (PlayStation Productions and its corporate cousin Sony Pictures Television produced the series along with Universal Television.)
Some characters exist in both Twisted Metal mediums, including the psychotic clown Sweet Tooth, perhaps the show's most macabre creation. A bare-chested hulk with a leering clown mask -- he is played by the body of the wrestler Joe Seanoa paired with the voice of the actor Will Arnett -- Sweet Tooth controls what is left of Las Vegas, driving what appears to be a refurbished ice cream truck and wielding a machete that he uses to slash open all comers.
At one point he assembles a ragtag army of outcasts to do his bidding, giving him a literal insane clown posse. But Sweet Tooth has one thing in common with John and Quiet: an enmity for Agent Stone (a platinum-dyed Thomas Haden Church), a petty tyrant who essentially runs the country.
Somehow, amid all the mayhem, "Twisted Metal" finds room for contemporary class consciousness. John has been tasked with a cross-country trip, from New San Francisco to New Chicago and back, with the promise of a cozy life by the bay if he succeeds. New San Francisco is a walled urban paradise where the swells dwell, while throughout most of the country, it's a mad scramble to survive. Inside the wall you can eat dinner. Outside, you might be dinner.
"The metaphors abound," Beatriz ("Brooklyn Nine-Nine") said. "It is silly, it is violent, it is funny. But so much of the show is about who has and who doesn't. There's an argument to be made that there's a certain kind of cannibalism happening now, within our society, at all times."
But fans of the Twisted Metal game needn't worry that their beloved bedlam has gone highbrow. The series's bread and butter remains people shooting and slicing each other to pieces, often while driving cars equipped to do the same. This is car culture at the end of the world, a land of last resorts. So it seems appropriate that John drives not a souped-up sports car but a true beater, modified to handle the wear and tear of the apocalypse. John's true love in "Twisted Metal" isn't Quiet, but Evelyn -- or, as her license plate reads, EV3L1N.
Mackie can relate. After his breakout performance in "We Are Marshall," from 2006, he was able to purchase his dream car: a 1964 ½ Ford Mustang (as the earliest Mustang models are known by enthusiasts). He's been tinkering with it ever since. The car's name is Marshall.
"Me and Marshall are always cruising and enjoying our time together," Mackie said. "Before I had my sons, Marshall was like my best friend. Some people talk to their plants, some people talk to their cats. I would talk to my car."
Beatriz had a slightly different automotive coming-of-age. She was acting in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival when she started thinking of moving to Los Angeles. One problem: She didn't know how to drive, and a car is a must in L.A. So she learned from a friend and fellow Shakespearean, Catherine E. Coulson, perhaps best known as the Log Lady in "Twin Peaks." Coulson would take Beatriz around Ashland, Ore., where the festival was located, in her Prius, a far more fanciful image than any you will see in "Twisted Metal."
Beatriz's maiden voyages with the Log Lady have given way to faster adventures: She was grand marshal for the Indianapolis 500 in May. As part of the gig she got to ride shotgun in an Indy car before the race, hitting speeds of 190 miles per hour. "Could have gone faster, would've been great," she said.
All that fun, and not a killer clown in sight.

Full text: New films and classics just keep coming to the streaming service.
As Netflix pours more of its resources into original content, Amazon Prime Video is picking up the slack, adding new movies for its subscribers each month. Its catalog has grown so impressive, in fact, that it's a bit overwhelming. Here are eight of our favorite movies included with a Prime subscription right now.
'Selma' (2014)
Ava DuVernay directs this "bold and bracingly self-assured" dramatization of the events surrounding Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1965 marches for voting rights in Selma, Ala. DuVernay is telling the story not of a man but of a movement; the picture bursts with the urgency of promises unkept. David Oyelowo is astonishing as King, capturing the unmistakable cadences but also the man -- uncertain, jocular, determined. The stellar ensemble cast includes Dylan Baker, Carmen Ejogo, André Holland, Stephan James, Wendell Pierce, Tim Roth, Tessa Thompson, Lorraine Toussaint, Tom Wilkinson and Oprah Winfrey. (For more historical drama, try "The French Lieutenant's Woman.")
'Tár' (2022)
Cate Blanchett is Lydia Tár, an acclaimed orchestral conductor, composer and instructor whose precariously balanced life and career begin to collapse around her in this "cruelly elegant, elegantly cruel" character study from the writer and director Todd Field ("In the Bedroom"). Blanchett was nominated for best actress at last year's Oscars for her electrifying turn as a woman whose genius has long excused her considerable flaws; Nina Hoss is terrific as the longtime partner who can no longer look the other way. Field directs the story of Lydia's fall from grace with chilly, riveting precision and welcome psychological nuance. (Hoss is also excellent in "A Most Wanted Man.")
'Jackie Brown' (1997)
Quentin Tarantino followed up "Pulp Fiction" by reworking Elmore Leonard's novel "Rum Punch" into a vehicle for the 1970s exploitation movie legend Pam Grier, and the result has all the hallmarks of a Tarantino picture: memorable and musical dialogue, playful construction, eccentric supporting characters and a throwback aesthetic. But Grier and Robert Forster (as a seen-it-all bail bondsman) lend the picture a maturity and gravitas that can elude even Tarantino's best work. (Crime caper fans should also check out "Bound.")
'Night Moves' (2014)
Many of Kelly Reichardt's acolytes consider this eco-thriller to be among the director's lesser efforts, and when placed against "Wendy and Lucy" or "First Cow," perhaps that's true. But Reichardt on her worst day surpasses most of her contemporaries on their best, and there's much to recommend in this morally thorny story of a trio of radical environmentalists (Jesse Eisenberg, Dakota Fanning and Peter Sarsgaard) as they meticulously plot and execute a dangerous act of protest. Reichardt hits the thriller beats, but casually and modestly; her emphasis, as ever, is on character, and she finds as much suspense in interactions as in the action itself.
'Escape From New York' (1981)
This sci-fi-action thriller from the director John Carpenter imagines the distant future, 1997, in which the island of Manhattan has become a giant, chaotic, maximum-security prison. (Considering the state of the city in the early '80s, it wasn't hard to imagine.) A grizzled Kurt Russell stars as Snake Plissken, a bank robber attempting to rescue the kidnapped president of the United States from the island. Carpenter manically orchestrates Plissken's mission as a darkly funny free-for-all, loaded with slam-bang set pieces and memorable supporting turns by a rogues' gallery of character actors. Our critic called it "by far Mr. Carpenter's most ambitious, most riveting film to date." (For more classic genre cinema, check out "The Bird With the Crystal Plumage.")
'No Country for Old Men' (2007)
Joel and Ethan Coen won their first Oscars for best picture and best director (and their second for best screenplay) for this gripping, moody, and darkly funny adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's dusty 2005 novel. Telling the stories of a ruthless killer (Javier Bardem, who took home an Oscar for best supporting actor), a morally flexible rancher (Josh Brolin) and a small-town sheriff whose paths cross when a border drug deal goes south, the Coens construct a Western contemporary in both its setting and style, setting the table for the standard standoffs and shootouts, then turning those expectations inside out. The result is a picture with genre trappings, but more on its mind than gunplay and drug money.
'Pariah' (2011)
Dee Rees made her feature directorial debut with this heartfelt and thoughtful story about a Brooklyn teenager (the "incandescent" Adepero Oduye) named Alike, and her attempt to come out as a lesbian -- fully aware of the resistance she will face from her controlling mother (Kim Wayans). Rees, who also wrote the screenplay, is well versed in the lives these characters live, the neighborhoods they inhabit and the lies they tell one another in order to coexist. But she also captures the seductiveness of the subcultures Alike begins to explore, and the alternative they present: the choice to live one's truth, with no apologies. (If you like coming-of-age dramas, stream "Purple Rain.")
'Legally Blonde' (2001)
A fair number of critics initially dismissed this witty and wacky Reese Witherspoon vehicle as lightweight, disposable fluff -- a reaction strangely appropriate to this story of a young woman whose peers underestimate her based on looks and impressions. But just as Elle Woods thrived, against all odds, at Harvard Law School, this summer comedy has become a cultural touchstone thanks to its quotable dialogue, masterfully modulated lead performance and timeless message about self-determination in the face of adversity. (For more breezy, female-fronted comedy, check out "Earth Girls Are Easy" and "Valley Girl.")

Full text: Fleeing the strictures of modern life in a hypercompetitive South Korea, a young woman found a calmer way of life in Mexico -- and millions of social media followers.
To her mother in South Korea, SuJin Kim is a failure: She's over 30, single and not working for a big Korean corporation.
But to her millions of followers in Latin America, she has become a relatable friend and a teacher of all things Korean. In Mexico, where she lives, they know her, in fact, as "Chinguamiga," her online nickname, a mash-up of the words for friend in Korean and Spanish.
Her success has been propelled not just by her ingenuity and charisma, but also by a wave of South Korean popular culture that has swept the world, driven in part by a government effort to position the country as a cultural giant and to exert a soft power.
In her homeland, Ms. Kim, 32, struggled with the grind of a hypercompetitive society where success is defined narrowly and young women face diminishing labor prospects, grueling work schedules, sexism and restrictive beauty standards.
In Mexico, the growing interest in all things Korean has made her a social-media sensation with more than 24 million followers on TikTok and over eight million subscribers to her YouTube channel, allowing her to gain popularity, financial stability and a romantic partner -- all on her own terms.
"There was a packaging that she came with," said Dr. Renato Balderrama, who leads the Center for Asian Studies at the Autonomous University of Nuevo León in Monterrey, an industrial hub with an expanding Korean presence. "She had all this training in Korea, in this new Korea that allows her to land in a place like Mexico and be successful."
A sort of a teacher of comparative pop culture, Ms. Kim offers lessons on popular Korean soap operas, lyrics, fashion standards, traditions and social norms. She once worked as a waitress in Mexico for a day and posted about her confusion with tips. (South Korea is a no-tip country.) She showed followers how Korean students crammed for exams. She started traveling across Mexico tasting regional delicacies.
Her social media success has attracted invitations to events, award nominations, magazine spreads and sponsorship deals, and yielded a popular business teaching Korean language classes online. She moved from Monterrey to Mexico City to gain more exposure and grow her brand.
Ms. Kim's budding empire now includes an online store of Korean beauty products. She will be featured as a contestant in the second season of HBO's "Bake Off Celebrity" show.
Ms. Kim's success tracks the growth of Korean influence in Mexico and the region.More than 2,000 Korean companies have a presence in Mexico, part of a so-called near-shoring strategy that has driven larger corporations -- Kia, LG, Samsung, Hyundai, among others -- to take advantage of a free-trade agreement with Canada and the United States.
South Korea has not only arrived in Mexico with jobs, cars and cellphones, but also with something more intangible: its own idea of modern culture. K-pop, K-beauty and K-dramas have shown Latin Americans a new, different way to be cool.
K-pop bands have been performing to increasingly bigger and sold-out venues since 2012. This year, a summer festival will bring 16 Korean groups to Mexico City, with ticket prices starting at around $ 170.
Some newsstands specialize in magazines, posters and merchandise about South Korean celebrities. Netflix offers dubbing in "Latin Spanish" for Korean shows. Movie theaters stream live K-pop concerts performed abroad.
Ms. Kim grew up in Seoul but after a work-study stint in Canada and traveling through South America, she returned home and found life in South Korea stifling.
"I don't want to go back to my old life," she remembered thinking.
She moved to Mexico in 2018, driven by a desire to experience life in Latin America and trying to escape severe burnout. She worked for a Korean multinational corporation and found the work rhythm all too familiar so she started teaching Korean.
Then the pandemic upended the world.
"It's my moment, I have nothing to do," she recalled thinking before she started to post her Korean classes on YouTube. "I had zero views, nobody saw me."
Her videos were straightforward language lessons "Easy Words in Korean -- 3 Minutes!" But then she pivoted to TikTok and uploaded a short clip, this time explaining Korean culture.
"That same day it had like 5,000 views and I was like, what?!" she said, her pointy nails adorned with jeweled stars, bows and moons.
Very quickly, her TikTok following exploded.
One afternoon this year, Ms. Kim welcomed her students to a virtual Korean class on Zoom; she charges $ 35 to $ 45 for each four-week session, with one 90-minute class per week.
When the class started, 76 students had logged on. There were young girls and bespectacled moms and at least one longhaired businessman, spread across Central and South America.
Ms. Kim's bright blue curls bounced on the screen as she moved her head approvingly.
When a student trying to figure out how to pluralize singular nouns asked, "No plural?" she chirped: "No! How neat, right?"
After finishing college in South Korea, Ms. Kim said she experienced severe stress. "I wanted to die and I wished to rest," she said in one of her most popular videos. She has spoken openly about being hospitalized to take care of her mental health.
She attributes her exhaustion to Korea's culture of sacrifice and grind that helped the country become an economic powerhouse after the Korean War.
"Everything is quick, quick, now, right this second," Dr. Balderrama said. "This created a culture where there's no place for mediocrity, there's no place for those unwilling to compete."
In Mexico, Ms. Kim hoped to find a more joyous life: "I saw how Latin culture is, how Latin people live and they're living happily," she said. "I don't want to waste a single moment I'm in Latin America because it's so precious to me."
But if Ms. Kim has found a passion and a business, she has not completely found the peace of mind she was seeking. She's in therapy to deal with what she described as some depression and anxiety.
Her large following and popularity has bred fear: "I feel people will forget me, that nobody will like me," she said, worried about the toll of having to come up with creative content to remain relevant.
"I also have this problem with haters, with people's comments, which affect me," she added.
She does get criticized online by users who say she should go back to Korea, who ask whether she pays taxes in Mexico (she says she does) and who consider her another foreigner lured by life on the cheap and who contribute to the gentrification of parts of the country at the expense of Mexican residents.
In a recent video,as she prepared to go home for a visit she showed an ID card that she said was proof of her status as a legal resident. She wanted to dispel any rumors she had to leave the country because she was on a tourist visa.
Ms. Kim declined to discuss her citizenship status with The New York Times, but months ago she posted a video in which she said she'd taken the exam to become a citizen of Mexico.
By many standards, Ms. Kim has made it. But what about her mother's standards?
"I don't think she'll change her mind about success -- that I'm not a success, that's a fact for her," she said following her visit home. "She's still more worried than happy for me."
Still, after meeting Ms. Kim's boyfriend and his family in South Korea, her parents promised to visit her in Mexico.

Exploring Hidden Corners Of the '70s: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Saved from cancellation, the porn-mag comedy is still a chaotic ride, but its ideas are more than skin-deep.
"This feels like the beginning of something," Joyce Prigger (Ophelia Lovibond) says in Season 2 of "Minx." She's referring to the early '70s, when America was rethinking gender roles and sexual rules, creating an opening for her to start the feminist porn magazine that gives the comedy its title.
But this was almost the end of something for "Minx." HBO Max, which ran the first season in 2022, canceled the show as the second was finishing production, leaving fans holding an empty brown wrapper.
Season 1, in which Joyce started Minx with the low-rent pornographer Doug Renetti (Jake Johnson), was a rough ride; its raunchy pop history and sitcommy odd-couple high jinks didn't completely mesh. But I'd rather watch a show that does an exciting thing inconsistently than one that does a dull thing well.
The series was revived by Starz, which brings it back on Friday. The eight new episodes don't entirely clean up its freewheeling mess, but they make up for it in verve and enthusiasm. "Minx" is a racy, smart snapshot, and you just have to accept certain blemishes unretouched.
Created by Ellen Rapoport, "Minx" is a bit of an alternative history. The sort of magazine it envisions -- essentially Ms., if it added beefcake centerfolds and became a newsstand blockbuster -- didn't exist. But the series makes a credible-enough-for-comedy case that, if the dissolute energies of the post-'60s were channeled slightly differently, it might have.
"Minx" introduced Joyce as an idealistic Vassar grad pitching her mock-up for a polemical journal, The Matriarchy Awakens. Doug, a motor-mouthed sleaze with a nose for the zeitgeist, believes she's on to something, but only if they can make it commercial. "You gotta hide the medicine," he says, even if that means using male models with nothing to hide. ("Minx" may be TV's biggest bastion of equal-opportunity nudity.)
The first season followed the retooling of Doug's company, Bottom Dollar Productions, into the scrappy vanguard of the sexual revolution. Season 2 finds the magazine successful, but struggling to keep its soul.
Joyce, who the first season often caricatured as naïve and uptight ("prig" is in her surname), is now a confident boss, becoming the kind of public intellectual she set out to be. Doug is adjusting to achieving his biggest success at the price of becoming superfluous in his own company. And their platonic pairing adds a third wheel in Constance Papadopoulos (Elizabeth Perkins), a wealthy investor who speaks the language of empowerment but whose money comes with strings.
But "Minx" really excels with its supporting characters. Joyce's sister, Shelly (Lennon Parham, whose performance is a small miracle), is rethinking her suburban-mom existence after a fling with Bambi (Jessica Lowe), Bottom Dollar's C.F.O., or "Chief Fun Officer." Tina (Idara Victor), Doug's lieutenant and on-and-off lover, explores her own career ambitions, which may not be compatible with Doug's.
The season's most distinctive subplot involves Richie (Oscar Montoya), Minx's art director and photographer. His sensibility as a gay artist has shaped and elevated the magazine's aesthetic, but he has to keep his creativity in check lest Minx be seen as a magazine for gay men. His pet project, an artistic photo shoot at a bathhouse, is a window on another kind of liberation that couldn't as easily go mainstream.
"Minx" plays all of this lightly, both awed and amused by the treasures it finds in our culture's attic. The tone is less like "The Deuce," HBO's historical drama of the porn biz, and more like "GLOW," the Netflix comedy about women's pro wrestling in the 1980s. Like Doug, it believes in hiding the medicine.
"Minx" has a playful feel for how the politics of an era gets exposed -- in this case, fully frontally -- by its pulp culture. A Season 2 episode takes place at a screening of the landmark porn flick "Deep Throat," which is enough of a mainstream sensation that the showing attracts "the Alans: Alda and Arkin." (Joyce scoffs at the movie's premise, in which a woman finds satisfaction through a clitoris located in her throat. "It's always in the last place you look," Tina says.)
Period comedies like this often end up speed-running through familiar cultural markers. "Minx" has its share of swinger parties and streakers; the Minx office gathers to watch the "Battle of the Sexes" tennis match with Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs.
But "Minx" also has an offbeat interest in the intellectual and artistic history of the time. At the "Deep Throat" premiere, for instance, Joyce bumps into Joan Didion, a celebrity sighting that impresses her more than either Alan. Another episode works in appearances by young versions of the Rolling Stone photographer Annie Leibovitz and the astronomer Carl Sagan.
The show's willingness to zig where '70s stories usually zag is reflected in its aesthetic. The soundtrack, overseen by the music supervisor Brienne Rose, mostly avoids the usual AM-rock suspects in favor of deep cuts like "Jesus Was a Cross Maker" by the underappreciated singer-songwriter Judee Sill -- who is portrayed in Season 2 at a jam session with an about-to-break-big Linda Ronstadt.
That "Minx" feels especially excited about exploring hidden corners of the '70s -- the should-have-beens along with the household names -- says something about its underdog heart. It remains a comedy about authenticity and compromise, how much you can change your vision until it isn't your vision anymore.
Season 2 can feel disjointed and compressed, as if some connective material was cut to get it to eight episodes (the first ran for 10). But it finishes strong, as the conflict over Richie's bathhouse project grows and Minx has to consider whether it's too risky for the magazine to speak to gay men, or even gay women.
At moments like this, the historical fiction feels not entirely historical. The idea of whether the larger audience is "ready" for a certain population to be openly themselves -- whether one group's liberation justifies putting another's on hold -- is not so different from what you sometimes hear today in, for instance, the debate over transgender rights. "Minx" is a spicy, fun look back at the beginning of something. But it's also a reminder that some patterns never end.

How TV Writing Became a Dead-End Job: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The writers say Hollywood studios are increasingly limiting their roles in television productions, highlighting a trend for white-collar workers.
For the six years he worked on "The Mentalist," beginning in 2009, Jordan Harper's job was far more than a writing gig. He and his colleagues in the writers' room of the weekly CBS drama were heavily involved in production. They weighed in on costumes and props, lingered on the set, provided feedback to actors and directors. The job lasted most of a year.
But by 2018, when he worked on "Hightown," a drama for Starz, the business of television writing had changed substantially. The writers spent about 20 weeks cranking out scripts, at which point most of their contracts ended, leaving many to scramble for additional work. The job of overseeing the filming and editing fell largely to the showrunner, the writer-producer in charge of a series.
"On a show like 'The Mentalist,' we'd all go to set," Mr. Harper said. "Now the other writers are cut free. Only the showrunner and possibly one other writer are kept on board."
The separation between writing and production, increasingly common in the streaming era, is one issue at the heart of the strike begun in May by roughly 11,500 Hollywood writers. They say the new approach requires more frequent job changes, making their work less steady, and has lowered writers' earnings. Mr. Harper estimated that his income was less than half what it was seven years ago.
While their union, the Writers Guild of America, has sought guarantees that each show will employ a minimum number of writers through the production process, the major studios have said such proposals are "incompatible with the creative nature of our industry." The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood studios, declined to comment further.
SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union that went on strike last week, said its members had also felt the effects of the streaming era. While many acting jobs had long been shorter than those of writers, the union's executive director, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said studios' "extreme level of efficiency management" had led shows to break roles into smaller chunks and compress character story lines.
But Hollywood is far from the only industry to have presided over such changes, which reflect a longer-term pattern: the fracturing of work into "many smaller, more degraded, poorly paid jobs," as the labor historian Jason Resnikoff has put it.
In recent decades, the shift has affected highly trained white-collar workers as well. Large law firms have relatively fewer equity partners and more lawyers off the standard partner track, according to data from ALM, the legal media and intelligence company. Universities employ fewer tenured professors as a share of their faculty and more untenured instructors. Large tech companies hire relatively fewer engineers, while raising armies of temps and contractors to test software, label web pages and do low-level programming.
Over time, said Dr. Resnikoff, an assistant professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, "you get this tiered work force of prestige workers and lesser workers" -- fewer officers, more grunts. The writers' experience shows how destabilizing that change can be.
The strategy of breaking up complex jobs into simpler, lower-paid tasks has roots in meatpacking and manufacturing. At the turn of the 20th century, automobiles were produced largely in artisanal fashion by small teams of highly skilled "all around" mechanics who helped assemble a variety of components and systems -- ignition, axles, transmission.
By 1914, Ford Motor had repeatedly divided and subdivided these jobs, spreading more than 150 men across a vast assembly line. The workers typically performed a few simple tasks over and over.
For decades, making television shows was similar in some ways to the early days of automaking: A team of writers would be involved in all parts of the production. Many of those who wrote scripts were also on set, and they often helped edit and polish the show into its final form.
The "all around" approach had multiple benefits, writers say. Not least: It improved the quality of the show. "You can write a voice in your head, but if you don't hear it," said Erica Weiss, a co-showrunner of the CBS series "The Red Line," "you don't actually know if it works."
Ms. Weiss said having her writers on the set allowed them to rework lines after the actors' table read, or rewrite a scene if it was suddenly moved indoors.
She and other writers and showrunners said the system also taught young writers how to oversee a show -- essentially grooming apprentices to become the master craftspeople of their day.
But it is increasingly rare for writers to be on set. As in manufacturing, the job of making television shows is being broken down into more discrete tasks.
In most streaming shows, the writers' contracts expire before the filming begins. And even many cable and network shows now seek to separate writing from production.
"It was a good experience, but I didn't get to go to set," said Mae Smith, a writer on the final season of the Showtime series "Billions." "There wasn't money to pay for me to go, even for an established, seven-season show."
Showtime did not respond to a request for comment. Industry analysts point out that studios have felt a growing need to rein in spending amid the decline of traditional television and pressure from investors to focus on profitability over subscriber growth.
In addition to the possible effect on a show's quality, this shift has affected the livelihoods of writers, who end up working fewer weeks a year. Guild data shows that the typical writer on a network series worked 38 weeks during the season that ended last year, versus 24 weeks on a streaming series -- and only 14 weeks if a show had yet to receive a go-ahead. About half of writers now work in streaming, for which almost no original content was made just over a decade ago.
Many have seen their weekly pay dwindle as well. Chris Keyser, a co-chair of the Writers Guild's negotiating committee, said studios had traditionally paid writers well above the minimum weekly rate negotiated by the union as compensation for their role as producers -- that is, for creating a dramatic universe, not just completing narrow assignments.
But as studios have severed writing from production, they have pushed writers' pay closer to the weekly minimum, essentially rolling back compensation for producing. According to the guild, roughly half of writers were paid the weekly minimum rate last year -- about $ 4,000 to $ 4,500 for a junior writer on a show that has received a go-ahead and about $ 7,250 for a more senior writer -- up from one-third in 2014.
Writers also receive residual payments -- a type of royalty -- when an episode they write is reused, as when it is licensed into syndication, but say opportunities for residuals have narrowed because streamers typically don't license or sell their shows. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers said in its statement that the writers' most recent contract had increased residual payments substantially.
(Actors receive residuals, too, and say their pay has suffered in other ways: The streaming era creates longer gaps between seasons, during which regular characters aren't paid but often can't commit to other projects.)
The combination of these changes has upended the writing profession. While the recent television boom has created more jobs -- there are about one-third more Writers Guild members today than a decade ago, and between one and a half and two times as many scripted shows -- the guild says those jobs have been degraded, even as spending on content has escalated.
With writing jobs ending more quickly, even established writers must look for new ones more frequently, throwing them into competition with their less-experienced colleagues. And because more writing jobs pay the minimum, studios have a financial incentive to hire more-established writers over less-established ones, preventing their ascent.
"They can get a highly experienced writer for the same price or just a little more," said Mr. Harper, who considers himself fortunate to have enjoyed success in the industry.
Writers also say studios have found ways to limit the duration of their jobs beyond walling them off from production.
Many junior writers are hired for a writers' room only to be "rolled off" before the room ends, leaving a smaller group to finish the season's scripts, said Bianca Sams, who has worked on shows including the CBS series "Training Day" and the CW program "Charmed."
"If they have to pay you weekly, at a certain point it becomes expensive to keep people," Ms. Sams said. (The wages of junior writers are tied more closely to weeks of work rather than episodes.)
The studios have chafed at writers' description of their work as "gig" jobs, saying that most are guaranteed a certain number of weeks or episodes, and that they receive substantial health and pension benefits.
But many writers fear that the long-term trend is for studios to break up their jobs into ever-smaller pieces that are stitched together by a single showrunner -- the way a project manager might knit together software from the work of a variety of programmers. Some worry that eventually writers may be asked to simply rewrite chatbot-generated drafts.
"I think the endgame is creating material in the cheapest, most piecemeal, automated way possible," said Zayd Dohrn, a Writers Guild member who oversees the screen and stage master's degree program at Northwestern University, "and having one layer of high-level creatives take the cheaply generated material and turn it into something."
He added, "It's the way coders write code -- in the most drone-like way."

Full text: In a raunchy, rollicking post-pandemic (not that one) comedy from New Zealand, the men are gone but the women are as nasty to one another as ever.
Contains many spoilers for Season 1 of "Creamerie."
The New Zealand post-viral-apocalypse comedy "Creamerie" likes to begin an episode right where the previous one left off. So the show's second season, which premiered Saturday on Hulu, begins mid-cliffhanger: Its three heroines cowering and aghast as they watch their mean-girl nemesis French kiss the traitorous man they thought they loved. (One of them is his sister, another his widow. It's complicated.) Underscoring the action are the moans of the naked men in the background who are attached, like dairy cattle, to stainless steel tubes that are rhythmically collecting their semen.
Oh, did I forget to mention that the viral apocalypse in question only killed humans with Y chromosomes? "Creamerie" is in the science fiction subgenre of world-without-men shows; others include the new Netflix anime "Ooku: The Inner Chambers" and FX on Hulu's "Y: The Last Man" from 2021. These are actually, almost invariably, world-with-a-handful-of-men shows, since much of their pleasure comes from seeing what happens when the power balance is reversed.
"Creamerie" was created by the actresses who play the leads -- J.J. Fong, Perlina Lau and Ally Xue -- along with the writer and director Roseanne Liang. The four have been collaborators for a decade, making Web series about relatably snarky young women in urban New Zealand. What distinguishes "Creamerie" is how seamlessly it incorporates the raunchy, silly, casually comic vibe of those online shorts (along with their female point of view) into a sci-fi-series framework. It's a clever but unassuming show, which is why its package of laughs, sentiment, consciousness raising and low-budget Saturday-serial action has considerable appeal.
Fong, Lau and Xue play Jamie (determined, sorrowful, sexy), Pip (uptight, repressed, resourceful), and Alex (rebellious, profane, loyal), the proprietors of a dairy farm in rural New Zealand. (That they're in the milk business is a joke that pays off in full with the reveal of the semen farm at the end of Season 1.) Eight years before, a virus was thought to have killed all men and it continues to kill male embryos; the survival of the remaining half of the human race is presumed to depend on the leftover inventory of sperm banks, which is distributed by lottery to prospective mothers.
The fundamental question of these shows is how women would act if they were in charge, and the answer "Creamerie" offers is deflating but comically fertile: They would be really, really mean. The area around the farm is governed by Nordic-featured, yoga-toned, ecru-linen-wearing Amazons, led by Lane (the excellent Tandi Wright), an unholy cross of Gwyneth Paltrow and Martha Stewart who wields "wellness" as a tool of oppression. In the new world ruled by women, if you question authority, you are dispatched for a lobotomy -- it's called being permed -- and if you don't fit the right physical and racial mold, your place in society may be tending cows in the countryside.
Of course, Lane and her cohorts are keeping secret the existence of a few surviving men, one of whom, Bobby (Jay Ryan), shows up at the farm. His arrival turns Jamie, Pip and Alex into reluctant insurgents, sending them on an antic, highly messy journey of discovery, liberation and violent payback, one that continues through the second season against ever greater odds.
Liang, who has directed all 12 episodes of "Creamerie" and written them with several other writers, primarily Dan Musgrove, is best known for the rousing 2020 action-horror feature "Shadow in the Cloud." Starring Chloë Grace Moretz, a B-17 bomber and a toothy special-effects gremlin, the film played like an extended, well-choreographed "Twilight Zone" episode. Like "Creamerie," it wasn't that deep or self-serious, but the confidence and brio with which it was made gave weight to its mix of feminist and maternal motifs and to its emotional payoffs.
Something similar happens in the series: the jokes, the shambolic action and the matter-of-fact satire of gender, race and class alchemize into something funnier and more moving than you might expect. Fong, Lau and Xue aren't, individually, expert comic performers, but together they have a rapport and timing that expertly serve the material.
In Season 2 the scope of the story expands, moving into Auckland, where the national government is led by a gently woke prime minister (Isabella Austin) with pink-and-blue hair and a furry green hipster hat. The heroines continue to find improbable escapes from their increasingly perilous situations, falling out and making up with one another in classic buddy-comedy fashion. And they remain gloriously themselves, no matter how dire things get.
Waking up after being tranquilized, not knowing where she is or why, Pip frantically checks her hair, in a joke that reaches back to the characters Lau plays in the collective's online shorts. Against the notion of a female utopia, "Creamerie" stubbornly insists on the primary value of the individual.

Full text: In an interview, the Australian actor discusses his character's big moment in the most recent episode and his role as ally to Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury.
This article includes spoilers for the fourth episode of "Secret Invasion."
At one point while on set for the latest Marvel TV show "Secret Invasion," Ben Mendelsohn and Samuel L. Jackson broke into song.
They had both taken a break from filming to listen to some tunes, and when "Poison Ivy" by the Coasters came on they began belting out the lyrics.
"I'll get the occasional word wrong, but Sam's all over it," Ben Mendelsohn, 54, said in an interview last week.
It's Mendelsohn's interactions with Jackson onscreen -- their two characters squabble like decades-long lovers as they attempt to stave off World War III -- that energize this latest installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Jackson's character, the grizzled superspy Nick Fury, has been around since before Tony Stark was Iron Man. In "Secret Invasion," streaming on Disney+, he's back to his old pastime of saving planet Earth -- this time from an invasion of shape-shifting aliens called Skrulls -- but after a hiatus in space, he seems slightly off kilter, slower and less formidable.
And so it is Mendelsohn's character Talos, a Skrull general, who steps in to help -- just as he's been doing for decades, as he reminds Fury: "Your life got a hell of a lot more charmed once I came into it." It thus feels fitting, though no less upsetting for fans, that Episode 4 ends with Talos sacrificing his life to help Fury complete one more mission.
This is Mendelsohn's third appearance in a Marvel production, after his character's introduction in "Captain Marvel" and a brief cameo in "Spider-Man: Far From Home." Now, the Australian actor is relishing the chance to be part of a show full of what he calls "old-fashioned Cold War thriller stuff."
Mendelsohn gained recognition in the United States for his role in the Australian crime drama film "Animal Kingdom," and he later starred in the Netflix show "Bloodline," which premiered in 2015. Born in Melbourne, he first got into acting by starring in school plays and memorizing every line from the movie, "Taxi Driver."
"Once I got bitten by that bug, I didn't look back," he said.
Not long after the premiere of last week's pivotal episode, Mendelsohn spoke about his role, his character's relationship with Nick Fury and whether Talos is truly dead. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
So far Marvel's TV series have taken different forms and explored a variety of issues. What are some of the key themes of this one?
I think there is a lot to do with trust and secrecy. I think there's a certain theme of mutability. You could take that on the obvious level with the whole Skrull-y thing, but I also think it's about the mutability of where someone is in their life. When I think about the show I think about it through the Nick Fury lens. I've always looked at it very much as Sam's piece. One of the real delights for me is that this relationship morphed between these two characters, which was not there from Day Zero. What I really love is how different Fury is, how different the world is post Infinity Gauntlet and what that does to loyalty. Because loyalty without stress or duress doesn't mean anything.
How has the relationship between Talos and Fury evolved, starting from "Captain Marvel"? At one point, Talos was impersonating Fury, right?
Yeah that was such a genius flip from Marvel to have Fury [in "Spider-Man: Far From Home"] be Talos the entire time. Ostensibly the two characters start out as enemies. And what we come to learn is how incredibly loyal Talos is to Fury. What we learn is that Fury owes his entire je ne sais quoi to these creatures. And if you want to think about how deeply Marvel can flip stuff on its head, they've taken what were the surf Nazi punks of the Marvel world and turned them into the incredibly effective ally of the humans.
Do you think Talos is too optimistic about the humans and the Skrull coexisting?
If you keep boiling the argument down, Talos's argument is really the only one that stands. Because if you take the Gravik (Kingsley Ben-Adir) kind of perspective and you go for domination, there is one thing that Talos correctly surmises: You will not beat them. It's their spot, and they have already shown that they can be incredibly effective at wiping out enormous numbers of beings. And so while you can look at what G'iah (Emilia Clarke) is going through and understand Gravik's frustration, it's similar to the frustrations that we've seen play out locally elsewhere. And you might well say, "OK, yeah that's right. Go for it and go for it now." But it's reckless, destructive. And it's immature both ideologically and in a realpolitik sense. So as idealistic as Talos may appear to be, he is really the only one with the genuine experience and genuine ability to call it. This is not a zero-sum game for humans and Skrull.
Given how this episode started, with the big reveal about G'iah's still being alive, is Talos really dead? Should we expect some kind of regeneration later on?
Well to answer that would be to be an enemy of what I do. My greatest loyalty is always to the audience, and I try not to undermine that in any way, shape, or form. But I can definitely tell you Talos's death is a turning point.
What has it been like to interact with Jackson both on-set and off?
The best things that were brought to this relationship onscreen were brought by Sam. Sam's the reason for the Skrull kiss at the very first time we see them together. It's Sam who really brings the template in the train scene that allows me to react off and against them. Sam and I have been able to work together because we don't take it too seriously. But we also try not to half-step. And the reason I look through the lens of Sam a.k.a. Nick Fury is because I come at it as a guy who watched "Jungle Fever" and just went crazy.
I think a lot of fans are wondering: What's the significance of the Skrull in the overarching narrative arc of the MCU?
Ever since they've been introduced and utilized well, they do present an ever-present threat. Because how do you know? That's one of the great things about "Secret Invasion." "Civil War" also has that flavor. It's just like, Who is who here?
The great strength of the studio is that they play what-if for real; they don't play what-if as an entertaining byline. They play it for real and keep integrating it. Once they have an event for "Secret Invasion," you can't un-have it.
While I was watching the show there was a point where I wondered if Fury was going to change into a Skrull halfway through?
Well, keep watching. Fury is more connected to the Skrull than any other human is.

S&P 500 Has Highest Close in 15 Months: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/s-amp-p-500-has-highest-close-15-months/docview/2838545134/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street pushed higher on Monday ahead of a week full of updates about where profits for big U.S. companies are heading.
The S&P 500 rose 17.37, or 0.4 percent, to 4,522.79 and its highest closing level in 15 months. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 76.32, or 0.2 percent, to 34,585.35, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 131.25, or 0.9 percent, to 14,244.95.
Stocks elsewhere around the world slipped after China reported weaker economic growth for the spring than economists had expected. Its recovery after the removal of pandemic restrictions has fallen short of forecasts. While that has helped to limit inflation globally, it has also diluted a main engine of growth for the world's economy.
The weak data from China, the world's second-largest economy, helped drag crude prices lower. Benchmark U.S. oil dropped to slightly above $ 74 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $ 1.37 to $ 78.50 per barrel. The hope among investors was that the disappointing figures would push Chinese authorities to approve more economic stimulus.
In the United States, the economy has remained resilient even though the boost from a Chinese recovery has not materialized. It has managed to avoid a long-predicted recession despite much higher interest rates meant to push down high inflation.
A survey released on Monday showed that manufacturing in New York State unexpectedly grew, beating economists' expectations for a contraction. Manufacturing has been one of the U.S. economy's weakest sectors.
The coming week will offer more details on how the economy has affected companies as corporate earnings season ramps up. Nearly 60 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to report their profits from April through June.
Expectations broadly are low. Analysts are forecasting the worst drop for earnings per share among S&P 500 companies since the pandemic was pummeling the economy in the spring of 2020, according to FactSet. They are also forecasting a third straight quarter of declines in profits.
Several banks and Delta Air Lines helped kick off the reporting season last week with reports that were better than expected. This week will feature reports from Bank of America, Netflix and Tesla, among others.
While last week's earnings reports offered a small sample size, the season's start was encouraging because of how strong corporate forecasts have generally been for future results, according to strategists at Bank of America.
"We expect the momentum to continue," strategists led by Savita Subramanian wrote in a BofA Global Research report. They predicted that earnings declines for S&P 500 companies would bottom out in this reporting season.
The latest monthly update on sales at U.S. retailers is also coming this week. Strong spending by U.S. consumers has been one of the main reasons for the economy's resilience, driven by a remarkably sturdy job market.
Such data and declining inflation have helped the S&P 500 soar nearly 18 percent so far this year. The hope among investors is that these signals will push the Federal Reserve to soon put a halt to its interest-rate increases.
To be sure, the stock market's big run also has critics warning that it has gotten too sure of itself. It is still not yet a certainty that the economy will avoid a recession, that inflation will continue to coast lower and that corporate profit growth will indeed recover.
The wide expectation is for the Fed to raise rates at its meeting next week, which would take the federal funds rate to its highest level since 2001. But the hope among traders nevertheless is that it will be the final increase of this cycle.
Lower interest rates help all kinds of stocks, but investors see big technology and other high-growth stocks as some of the biggest beneficiaries.

Strikes Could Hurt Fall Film Festivals: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Without stars on the red carpet, prestige titles like the Leonard Bernstein biopic "Maestro" and the Elvis Presley tale "Priscilla" may not get the push they need.
With summer movie season at its midpoint, Hollywood typically begins to turn its gaze toward the fall, when a trio of major film festivals acts as the unofficial kickoff to Oscar season. Seven of the last 10 best-picture winners had their debuts at a fall festival, coming out of the gate with standing ovations and critical acclaim that helped propel them through the monthslong awards-show gantlet.
But now that SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America are both on strike, could a protracted battle between the unions and the studios cause those fall launchpads to fizzle?
Though the writers' strike, which began May 2, didn't have much of an effect on the Cannes Film Festival that month, the actors' strike that started Friday may significantly reshape coming fests in Venice, Telluride, Colo., and Toronto. That's because SAG-AFTRA is prohibiting members from promoting any film while the strike is on, an across-the-board ban that includes interviews, photo calls and red-carpet duties. Without those appearances, festivals will be sapped of the star power that is invaluable to raising a film's profile.
The first event that will probably be affected is the Venice Film Festival, which begins its 80th edition on Aug. 30 with the premiere of the sexy tennis comedy "Challengers," starring Zendaya. Venice has lately rivaled Cannes for glamour and headlines, so the loss of famous actors would be a big blow. Nearly all the major moments at Venice last year were star-driven, from the viral clip of Brendan Fraser crying after the premiere of "The Whale" to the social-media scrutiny of Harry Styles and Chris Pine as they appeared to clash while promoting "Don't Worry Darling." (Though if there had been a strike, Florence Pugh, the star, would have had a better excuse for infamously skipping that film's news conference.)
The festival will announce its full lineup on July 25, and buzz suggests it could include highly anticipated films like Bradley Cooper's Leonard Bernstein biopic, "Maestro"; Sofia Coppola's "Priscilla," about the relationship between Elvis Presley and his wife, Priscilla; and "The Killer," a David Fincher thriller starring Michael Fassbender and Tilda Swinton. Those auteurs are at least famous enough to pick up some of the promotional slack, though Cooper might be in a bind as both the director and star of "Maestro," since any press he does could be seen as flouting SAG's prohibition.
The Telluride Film Festival, which runs Sept. 1-4 and shot to the spotlight the likes of "Lady Bird" and "Moonlight," should be less stricken by the absence of stars: That intimate Colorado gathering is a favorite of famous attendees because they're not required to do photo ops or media blitzes and can instead mill around like regular people.
But the Toronto International Film Festival, beginning Sept. 7, is a heady 10-day affair filled with red carpets, portrait studios and press junkets that will all shrink significantly if actors are forbidden to attend. Canadian businesses are already bracing for a hit to their bottom line if the festival contracts. Organizers issued a statement of concern last week: "The impact of this strike on the industry and events like ours cannot be denied. We will continue planning for this year's festival with the hope of a swift resolution in the coming weeks."
There is a workaround for actors to attend festivals, but it's a slim one: Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the SAG-AFTRA negotiator, has said that "truly independent" films able to secure interim agreements with the guild could have their stars do media duties. Still, that's a proviso more likely to spare the indie-focused Sundance Film Festival in January rather than fall festivals, where the biggest titles tend to hail from major studios. And if the SAG strike continues into January, it will be more than just festivals that feel the pinch.
A monthslong strike would hit the awards-season ecosystem with its toughest test since Covid: If stars can't attend ceremonies, could the events be held at all? (At least when these things were on Zoom, the nominated stars showed up.) Post-pandemic, prestige films need all the help they can get at the box office. If they can't be sustained by awards chatter and media-happy movie stars, studios could opt to move some more vulnerable year-end titles to 2024.
That could provide an awards-season advantage to streamers like Netflix, which don't have to factor the box office into decisions on what to debut or delay. And movies that have already had a big cultural moment -- like A24's "Past Lives," an art-house hit from June, or Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon," which will be released by Apple in October but received a major premiere at Cannes in May -- will be better positioned to thrive this awards season than films that may not have full-fledged press tours.
Will an agreement in this bitter battle be reached in time to save awards season? Even if both sides can compromise before the televised ceremonies begin, one change is likely to still be felt: Don't expect the usual list of studio executives to be quite so effusively thanked in acceptance speeches.

Full text: From angst-ridden military dads to the threat of doomsday cults, this month's action picks push their heroes to the edge.
'The Channel'
Rent or buy it on Amazon Prime Video or Google Play.
Since the even-keeled Jamie (Clayne Crawford), an Army veteran, returned home to New Orleans, times have been difficult: His daughter needs an operation. When his impulsive brother, Mic (Max Martini), approaches him about a bank robbery job, the financial gain becomes too much to ignore.
From its winding chase sequences to its immersive camera work, particularly the use of hand-helds, the screenwriter and director William Kaufman's "The Channel" is a brisk, white-knuckle crime flick.
The heist scene is the gripping centerpiece in a film about the bond held by brothers. It sees Mic and Jamie entering the bank with the perfect plan, but upon leaving they're ambushed by the F.B.I. The ensuing shootout, laced together by the editor Travis Medina's riveting cuts, results in a mountain of bullets and the pair on the run. With the two people the pair betrayed hot on their heels, the brothers must find a way to keep the money, and their lives.
'Cult Hero'
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
More action parody than horror film, the hilarious, gory "Cult Hero," from the director Jesse Thomas Cook, features a character who'd feel at home in a cheesy 1980s B-movie. The double-gun-toting, sunglasses-wearing Dale Domazar (Ry Barrett) hosts a show called "Cult Buster" where he travels the country trying to uncover dangerous sects. But when an episode goes bad -- resulting in the mass death of an entire clan -- Dale loses his fame and money and winds up living in a musky trailer. It's not until the self-absorbed real estate agent Kallie Jones (Liv Collins) approaches him to spring her husband from a cult led by Master Jagori (Tony Burgess) that he sees a chance for a comeback.
Apart from the brawling sequences -- Master Jagori repeatedly sends his followers to murder Kallie and Dale -- what really makes "Cult Hero" stand out are the committed performances. Barrett's sharp timing, cheesy appearance and oversize bravado recalls Steven Seagal or Hulk Hogan, while Collins delivers inspired quips and sight gags. The film even has a bopping revivalist folk song that'll keep your foot tapping, as the body count climbs.
'Iké Boys'
Rent or buy it on most major platforms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This apocalyptic film from Eric McEver is visually rich. It recounts how a Japanese director decided to make a movie about his premonition that a cadre of old gods imprisoned at the center of the earth might one day return to annihilate humanity. He makes an anime to instruct the viewer how to defeat these beings. Not only did the film bomb -- ending the director's career -- but the print became lost in a warehouse fire.
On the eve of the new millennium, somehow, the nerdy Oklahomans Shawn Gunderson (Quinn Lord) and his best friend, Vik Kapoor (Ronak Gandhi), have found a copy of the film on tape. They watch the anime with Miki (Christina Higa), a Japanese transfer student. The lost movie ends up turning Shawn into Ultraman and Vik into a Kaiju. With Miki, they must defeat the awakening gods and the local cult trying to revive them.
What "Iké Boys" lacks in budget, it makes up for in ingenuity and spirit. When the big action sequences happen, McEver turns to vivid animation to fill in the blanks. The film's lovably corny Kaiju costume recalls the Toho monster movies of the 1960s, and when the big emotional beats arrive, this tight, emotive cast delivers the theme of being yourself no matter what, with aplomb.
'Transfusion'
Rent or buy on most major platforms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This film, which, like "The Channel," is about a veteran who's in too deep, features Sam Worthington as the single, widowed father Ryan Logan. A couple of years prior, Ryan's pregnant wife died in a car crash, forcing Ryan to retire from the military to care for his son, Billy (Edward Carmody), who survived the accident. Now, Ryan's job as a wine salesman barely brings in enough money to pay for his son's schooling, and Billy continues to brush against the law, leading to him wrecking a rich lawyer's car.
To earn some cash, Ryan turns to his old army buddy Johnny (Matt Nable), who proposes they rob an apartment containing money that belongs to Johnny's crime boss.
Nable also wrote and directed the film, which has sturdy action sequences, like a sharp shootout by Ryan and Johnny against the crime boss. But also, with themes like PTSD, grief and self-harm, the film thrives as an affecting, understated family drama, boosted with an unforgettable, tender performance by Worthington.
'The Village'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Not all heroes are celebrated. We get that sense at the beginning of Michihito Fujii's film. Scenes of a young boy named Yu watching a Noh production are intercut with his father preparing to set himself ablaze after killing an industrialist who was planning to move a waste management plant to the village. The factory still came.
Because of his father's actions, the adult Yu (Ryusei Yokohama) is reviled around town. To pay down his mother's gambling debt, he works tirelessly day and night burying toxic waste in landfills for the plant. When his childhood sweetheart Misaki (Haru Kuroki) returns to town wanting to start a relationship, the opportunity for a better life arises. But the past doesn't die easily.
A taut crime film, "The Village" features big bad guys like the hateful Toru (Wataru Ichinose) and crummy industrialists using gangster tactics.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Los Angeles County has 88 cities. Ten million people. Two hundred-plus languages spoken.
And a nine-letter sign that, for much of the world, defines the entire region: HOLLYWOOD.
Los Angeles has long been regarded as the global "company town" for show business, and as a rare actors' strike upended the signature industry this week, the potential for cascading economic impacts across Southern California has emerged as a critical local issue. But economists disagree on just how extensively the simultaneous actors' and writers' strikes will be felt.
Even by the most generous estimates, Hollywood has never supported more than about 5 percent of employment in a region where many more people work in trade, health care, government and even Southern California's diminished manufacturing sector. Yet Hollywood pervades Los Angeles life in ways as big as a movie backdrop or as small as a street detour on some awards night.
For many, the ceased productions and darkened premieres are not just a threat to the flow of dollars to restaurants and retailers that cater to film crews, but also a blow to the region's cultural heart.
"To the extent that Hollywood defines America's idea of where I live, Hollywood's troubles become my troubles," said D.J. Waldie, a cultural historian in Southern California. "When Hollywood stops, a great many things stop here, and not just a few studios."
During the 2007 screenwriters' strike, the California economy lost $ 2.1 billion, according to one study. The last time unionized screenwriters and actors staged dual walkouts, in 1960, the strikes did not settle for nearly six months.
Economists on Friday said the length of the two strikes will largely determine its financial impact on Los Angeles, though some were more optimistic than others.
Lee Ohanian, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written extensively about California, estimated that about 20 percent of the local economy could be hit, in part because the industry generates so much revenue and has so many highly compensated local employees.
Chris Thornberg, a founding partner at the Los Angeles consulting firm Beacon Economics, said the strikes might not be felt locally for a long time because so much of show business has been focused on exploiting and distributing existing content.
"As long as people are paying for Hulu and buying Disney movies online, we're making money," Dr. Thornberg said. "Eventually, there will come a time when the lack of content will start to pinch, but this is a slow boil, not a rapid one."
The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, made it clear that she considered the labor standoff to be an urgent local issue and called on the studios and unions to "work around the clock" to reach an equitable agreement.
"This affects all of us and is essential to our overall economy," Mayor Bass said.
Less tangible is the potential impact on Southern California's self image. Show business is wrapped up in the region's civic identity in ways that are unparalleled in less-renowned cities.
An audience of 18.7 million people this year tuned in to the Academy Awards, Los Angeles' best known office party. Backdrops from Venice Beach to the Sixth Street Viaduct are regarded locally with pride as stars in their own right. Homeowners from the San Fernando Valley to South Pasadena run lucrative side hustles, renting their houses for film shoots and ads.
Though most of the famous names live in mansions behind gates, few Angelenos, even in far-flung exurbs, are without a celebrity story -- the producer spotted in Joshua Tree, the famous face in the next lane in traffic.
"Everywhere I go, people ask me the same question: What stars have I met?" said Stephen Cheung, the president and chief executive of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. "Nobody would ask me that if I were from another city."
Born in Hong Kong, Mr. Cheung, 44, said that he saw his first real celebrity in Los Angeles when he was about 10, through a car window. "We were near the convention center in downtown, and all of a sudden, a car pulled up and I saw Madonna get out."
Many also know stars the way anyone knows anyone in the nation's second-largest city: as neighbors or fellow parents or people walking their dogs. Entertainers sponsor local schools, embark on second careers as politicians, stump for state ballot initiatives and occasionally get into scrapes with the mayor for trying to fill their own potholes.
Democratic leaders throughout the liberal state have long been supportive; earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California extended a $ 330 million-a-year film and television tax credit program to encourage studios to keep productions at home.
Certain communities share a special bond.
"We have a lot of studio people who live in Burbank," Mimi House, a retired medical clinic administrative worker, said on Thursday while lunching with a group of fellow retirees in the Los Angeles suburb's "beautiful downtown" shortly after leaders of the actors' union, known as SAG-AFTRA, announced the walkout.
Without the entertainment industry, Burbank would be a "ghost town," added Virginia Bohr, a retired accountant at the table with Ms. House. Local officials recently renamed their airport Hollywood Burbank, though Hollywood is technically a neighborhood in Los Angeles, a separate city.
The region has long attracted show business aspirants from around the world who hope to catch their big break. Many scrape by for years before they find work outside the entertainment industry.
Thomas Whaley, a veteran teacher who for 23 years has coordinated an extensive visual and performing arts curriculum at the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, credited the entertainment community for drawing him to the region and helping to ensure the longstanding success of his program, which has become a statewide model for the breadth and quality of its offerings. Were it not for the local concentration of talent, he said, he might never have ended up in the job he has come to cherish.
"I moved to L.A. to play trombone for film and TV in 1990," said Mr. Whaley, who grew up in Rhode Island and studied to become a studio musician on full scholarships at Berklee College of Music in Boston and the University of Miami. "My mother kept saying, Come home, Rhode Island's great, and I was like, Mom, they don't have what I need."
Other Angelenos feel a disconnect with an industry whose workers have long been concentrated in parts of the city that are more affluent and white.
In Mid-City, a Los Angeles neighborhood several miles south of Hollywood that is predominantly Latino and Black, Rachel Johnson and Rosario Gomez, both 17, were more interested in frozen fruit treats from the local paleta shop than in the demands of Hollywood strikers.
"It's the least of our concerns," Ms. Johnson said of the picket lines, noting the struggling mom-and-pop businesses on their streets, rising rents and persistent homeless encampments.
"Yeah, there are bigger problems here, like gentrification," Ms. Gomez added.
Nearby at La Cevicheria, a tiny eatery on Pico Boulevard, Yejoo Kim, 29, who works in geopolitics, agreed that Hollywood "can feel worlds apart," even for Angelenos who were born and raised in the city, as she was.
But she and her roommate, David Choi, 27, also pointed to the large immigrant communities in Los Angeles that have been reflected with care in recent years in film and television.
"I feel a sense of solidarity," said Mr. Choi, a novelist interested in the pay standards that Hollywood sets for its writers. "I'd be happy to participate in a boycott of a show."

America’s Foreign Vacations Tell Us Something About the U.S. Economy

PARIS — Forget Emily. These days, a whole flood of Americans are in Paris.
People spent 2020 and 2021 either cooped up at home or traveling sparingly and mostly within the continental U.S. But after COVID-19 travel restrictions were lifted for international trips last summer, Americans are again headed overseas.
Although domestic leisure travel shows signs of calming — people are still vacationing in big numbers, but prices for hotels and flights are moderating as demand proves strong but not insatiable — foreign trips are snapping back with a vengeance. Americans are boarding planes and cruise ships to flock to Europe in particular, based on early data.
According to estimates from AAA, international travel bookings for 2023 were up 40% from 2022 through May. That is still down about 2% from 2019, but it’s a hefty surge at a time when some travelers are being held back by long passport-processing delays amid record-high applications. Tour and cruise bookings are expected to eclipse pre-pandemic highs, with especially strong demand for vacations to major European cities.
Paris, for example, experienced a huge jump in North American tourists last year compared with 2021, according to the city’s tourism bureau. Planned air arrivals for July and August of this year climbed by another 14.4% — to nearly 5% above the 2019 level.
“This year is just completely crazy,” said Steeve Calvo, a Parisian tour guide and sommelier whose company — The Americans in Paris — has been churning out visits to Normandy and French wine regions. He attributes some of the jump to a rebound from the pandemic and some to television shows and social media.
“‘Emily in Paris’: I never saw so many people in Paris with red berets,” he said, noting that the signature chapeau of the popular Netflix show’s heroine started to pop up on tourists last year. Other newcomers are eager to take coveted photos for their Instagram pages.
“In Versailles, the Hall of Mirrors, I call it the Hall of Selfie,” Calvo said, referring to a famous room in the palace.
Robust travel booking numbers and anecdotes from tour guides align with what companies say they are experiencing: From airlines to American Express, corporate executives are reporting a lasting demand for flights and vacations.
“The constructive industry backdrop is unlike anything that any of us have ever seen,” Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said during a June 27 investor day. “Travel is going gangbusters, but it’s going to continue to go gangbusters because we still have an enormous amount of demand waiting.”
Transportation Security Administration data shows that the daily average number of passengers who passed through U.S. airport checkpoints last month was 2.6 million, 0.5% above the June 2019 level, based on an analysis by Omair Sharif at Inflation Insights.
And in many foreign airports, the burst of American vacationers is palpable: Customs lines are packed with U.S. tourists, from Paris’ Charles de Gaulle to London’s Heathrow. The latter saw 8% more traffic from North America last month than in June 2019, based on airport data.
In a weird way, the rebound in foreign travel may be taking some pressure off U.S. inflation.
International flight prices, while surging for some routes, are not a big part of the U.S. consumer price index, which is dominated by domestic flight prices. In fact, airfares in the inflation measure dropped sharply in June from the previous month and are down nearly 19% from a year ago.
That is partly because fuel is cheaper and partly because airlines are getting more planes into the sky. Many pilots and air traffic controllers had been laid off or had retired, so companies struggled to keep up when demand started to recover after the initial pandemic slump, pushing prices sharply higher in 2022.
“We just didn’t have enough seats to go around last year,” Sharif said, explaining that although personnel issues persist, so far this year, the supply situation has been better. “Planes are still totally packed, but there are more planes.”
As people flock abroad, it is sapping some demand from hotels and tourist attractions in the United States. International tourists have yet to return to the United States in full force, so they are not entirely offsetting the wave of Americans headed overseas.
Domestic travel is hardly in a free fall — July 4 weekend travel probably set records, per AAA — but tourists are no longer so insatiable that hotels can keep raising room rates indefinitely. Prices for lodging away from home in the U.S. climbed by 4.5% in the year through June, which is far slower than the 25% annual increases hotel rooms were posting last spring. There is even elbow room at Disney World.
Even if it isn’t inflationary, the jump in foreign travel does highlight something about the U.S. economy: It’s hard to keep U.S. consumers down, especially affluent ones.
The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to cool growth since early 2022. Officials have made it more expensive to borrow money in hopes of creating a ripple effect that would cut into demand and force companies to stop lifting prices so much.
Consumption has slowed amid that onslaught, but it hasn’t tanked. Fed officials have taken note, remarking at their last meeting that consumption had been “stronger than expected,” minutes showed.
The resilience comes as many households remain in solid financial shape. People who travel internationally skew wealthier, and many are benefiting from a rising stock market and still-high home prices that are beginning to prove surprisingly immune to interest rate moves.
Those who do not have big stock or real estate holdings are experiencing a strong job market, and some are still holding onto extra savings built up during the pandemic. And it is not just vacation destinations feeling the momentum: Consumers are still spending on a range of other services.
“There’s this last blowoff of spending,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for insurance company Nationwide Mutual.
It could be that consumer resilience will help the U.S. economy avoid a recession as the Fed fights inflation. As has been the case at American hotels, demand that stabilizes without plummeting could allow for a slow and steady moderation of price increases.
But if consumers remain so ravenous that companies find they can still charge more, it could prolong inflation. That’s why the Fed is keeping a close eye on spending.
Bostjancic thinks consumers will pull back starting this fall. They are drawing down their savings, the labor market is cooling and it may simply take time for the Fed’s rate increases to have their full effect.
When it comes to many types of travel, there is no end in sight yet.
“Despite economic headwinds, we’re seeing very strong demand for summer leisure travel,” said Mike Daher, who leads the U.S. Transportation, Hospitality & Services practice at the consulting firm Deloitte.
Daher attributes that to three driving forces: People missed trips; social media is luring many to new places; and the advent of remote work is allowing professionals — “what we call the laptop luggers,” per Daher — to stretch out vacations by working a few days from the beach or the mountains.
Calvo is riding the wave, taking Americans on tours that showcase Paris’ shared history with France and driving them in minivan tours to Champagne.
“I have no clue if it’s going to last,” he said.

In Hollywood, the cool kids have joined the picket line.
I mean no offense, as a writer, to the screenwriters who have been on strike against film and TV studios for over two months. But writers know the score. We’re the words, not the faces. The cleverest picket sign joke is no match for the attention-focusing power of Margot Robbie or Matt Damon.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing TV and film actors, joined the writers in a walkout over how Hollywood divvies up the cash in the streaming era and how humans can thrive in the artificial-intelligence era. With that star power comes an easy cheap shot: Why should anybody care about a bunch of privileged elites whining about a dream job?
But for all the focus that a few boldface names will get in this strike, I invite you to consider a term that has come up a lot in the current negotiations: “Background actors.”
You probably don’t think much about background actors. You’re not meant to, hence the name. They’re the nonspeaking figures who populate the screen’s margins, making Gotham City or King’s Landing or the beaches of Normandy feel real, full and lived-in.
And you might have more in common with them than you think.
The lower-paid actors who make up the vast bulk of the profession are facing simple dollars-and-cents threats to their livelihoods. They’re trying to maintain their income amid the vanishing of residual payments, as streaming has shortened TV seasons and decimated the syndication model. They’re seeking guardrails against AI encroaching on their jobs.
There’s also a particular, chilling question on the table: Who owns a performer’s face? Background actors are seeking protections and better compensation in the practice of scanning their images for digital reuse.
In a news conference about the strike, a union negotiator said that the studios were seeking the rights to scan and use an actor’s image “for the rest of eternity” in exchange for one day’s pay. The studios argue that they are offering “groundbreaking” protections against the misuse of actors’ images, and counter that their proposal would only allow a company to use the “digital replica” on the specific project a background actor was hired for.
Still, the long-term “Black Mirror” implications — the practice was the actual premise of a recent episode — are unignorable. If a digital replica of you — without your bothersome need for money and the time to lead a life — can do the job, who needs you?
You could, I guess, make the argument that if someone is insignificant enough to be replaced by software, then they’re in the wrong business. But background work and small roles are precisely the routes to someday promoting your blockbuster on the red carpet. And many talented artists build entire careers around a series of small jobs. (Pamela Adlon’s series “Better Things” is a great portrait of the life of ordinary working actors.)
In the end, Hollywood’s fight isn’t far removed from the threats to many of us in today’s economy. “We are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines,” Fran Drescher, the actors’ guild president, said in announcing the strike.
You and I may be the protagonists of our own narratives, but in the grand scheme most of us are background players. We face the same risk — that every time a technological or cultural shift happens, companies will rewrite the terms of employment to their advantage, citing financial pressures while paying their top executives tens and hundreds of millions.
Maybe it’s unfair that exploitation gets more attention when it involves a union that Meryl Streep belongs to. (If the looming UPS strike materializes, it might grab the spotlight for blue-collar labor.) And there’s certainly a legitimate critique of white-collar workers who were blasé about automation until AI threatened their own jobs.
But work is work, and some dynamics are universal. As entertainment reporter and critic Maureen Ryan writes in “Burn It Down,” her investigation of workplace abuses throughout Hollywood, “It is not the inclination nor the habit of the most important entities in the commercial entertainment industry to value the people who make their products.”
If you don’t believe Ryan, listen to the anonymous studio executive, speaking of the writers’ strike, who told the trade publication Deadline, “The endgame is to allow things to drag out until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses.”
You may think of Hollywood creatives as a privileged class, but if their employers think about them like this, are you sure yours thinks any differently of you? Most of us, in Hollywood or outside it, are facing a common question: Can we have a working world in which you can survive without being a star?
You may never notice background actors if they’re doing their jobs well. Yet they’re the difference between a sterile scene and a living one. They create the impression that, beyond the close focus on the beautiful leads, there is a full, complete universe, whether it’s the galaxy of the “Star Wars” franchise or the mundane reality that you and I live in.
They are there to say that we, too, are out here, that we make the world a world, that we at least deserve our tiny places in the corner of the screen.

The Puny Power of 'Woke Capitalism': [Op-Ed]

Full text: Early last year, the musician India.Arie posted a video on her Instagram that caused a lot of headaches for my then-employer, Spotify. It was a mash-up of the many times Spotify's star podcaster, Joe Rogan, had used a racial slur for Black people on his show. I don't need to tell you which slur it was. Unsurprisingly, the video quickly went viral, and a huge uproar ensued.
Rogan had already stirred up controversy by airing Covid misinformation and interviews with transphobic speakers. For Spotify, a company based in Sweden (the supposed mecca of social democracy) that serves entertainment to a largely young, socially conscious consumer base and employs a young, socially conscious work force, you'd think it would be obvious -- if you were to listen to the characterization common from conservative politicians and "heterodox" pundits -- what would happen next. The dictates of "woke capitalism" would surely require a ritual sacrifice of Rogan, despite the huge sums Spotify had paid to bring his show exclusively to its platform. It wouldn't matter that he was the company's No. 1 podcaster. The woke mob had spoken!
Needless to say, that's not how things went. Rogan apologized in a long Instagram video, and Spotify's response was not to pull the plug on his show and torpedo the interests of the company's shareholders. Spotify stood by its star (even as several episodes were quietly removed). It also announced a $ 100 million fund to support underrepresented artists and podcasters. But, according to Bloomberg, a year later the company had spent less than 10 percent of the money.
Behold, the puny power of woke capitalism!
I have been thinking about this incident as I have watched ferocious campaigns building against companies that take even the most milquetoast stands on social and cultural issues, especially those involving gender and sexuality. It reached a peak last month with Pride, leaving a wake of social media videos of people outraged about things like onesies and koozies emblazoned with rainbows.
These fights won't stop with the end of Pride month. They are merely the skirmishes in what is likely to be a long culture war fueled by outrage about everything from the casting of a Black actor as Ariel in Disney's live-action remake of "The Little Mermaid" to investment funds including a modicum of concern about diversity and inclusion in deciding where to put their billions.
"Woke capital" is already a major theme of the Republican presidential race. The threat is apparently so great that Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida invoked Winston Churchill's famous Dunkirk speech, substituting "woke" for the Axis powers as enemy No. 1: "We will wage a war on the woke. We will fight the woke in education, we will fight the woke in the corporations, we will fight the woke in the halls of Congress." Vivek Ramaswamy is couching much of his campaign in the themes of his 2021 book, "Woke, Inc.," an excoriation of so-called woke capitalism that is somehow to blame not just for America's social woes, but its economic problems, too.
This hyping of the power of socially conscious capitalism is understandable given how aggressively the notion has been sold to companies and consumers. Research studies, many of them conducted by companies that advise businesses on corporate social responsibility, have touted the power of "purpose" to drive consumer loyalty.
Color me skeptical. Consumers make choices for many reasons: price, convenience and marketing. Maybe politics. The other day I went to my local Walgreens to buy toothpaste and ultimately chose not my favorite brand but the only one that wasn't under lock and key. I didn't want to wait for an employee to liberate the Colgate, so Crest it was. Needless to say, I did not use Google to find out which brand was more committed to bodily autonomy. What can I say? I was in a hurry.
My somewhat jaundiced view of the possibilities and perils of woke capitalism was shaped by seeing some of this play out from inside the corporate suite, albeit in the limited context of media and tech companies, running the editorial and business ends of a podcast company at Spotify and a global news organization, HuffPost, when it was owned by Verizon Media.
I have bad news for combatants on both sides of this war. For those on the left who take comfort in seeing big companies take bold stands on issues they care about, I'm here to tell you that those companies care much more about their bottom line than your beloved issue (see Spotify example above).
And those on the right who feel that the wind is at their back with successful boycotts of "woke" brands are likely to be disappointed for similar reasons. Even this year's big success -- a boycott of Bud Light after it worked with a transgender influencer as part of a broader social media campaign that apparently caused the stock of the brewing giant Anheuser-Busch to drop -- was a Pyrrhic victory: It is all but impossible to find beer companies that don't participate in celebrating Pride, thereby doing exactly what the right accuses them of: pushing a liberal agenda antithetical to conservative mores.
It turns out queer consumers and their allies are important to companies' bottom line, and -- especially in a tight labor market -- companies can hardly afford to alienate queer workers and their families and supporters. Even after getting dinged by conservative consumers and gay rights activists, Bud Light pledged to keep supporting queer businesses.
These fights disguise a bigger truth: Corporations, far from dictating cultural mores from some capitalist Mount Olympus, reflect and co-opt the social trends around them.
In 2018, as the Black Lives Matter movement gathered force, Nike created a controversial ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick, the Black football player who famously knelt during the national anthem to protest police racism and brutality toward Black civilians. The backlash was huge, but ultimately the social tide went in Nike's favor: Its stock price popped and the advertising campaign was seen as a bold success.
But corporations can also shift course, quite seamlessly, when the mood changes.
At Cannes Lions, an advertising festival held each June in the South of France, members of this year's jury that hands out awards for ad campaigns were instructed to steer clear of politics and celebrate work that was more focused on commercial success, Semafor reported.
This is a remarkable turnaround. I attended the festival a couple of times in my years as a media executive, and it often seemed like a competition to see what company could out-do-gooder the rest. It reminded me of a line from the HBO comedy "Silicon Valley," in which a tech executive declares, "I don't want to live in a world where someone else is making the world a better place better than we are."
After the murder of George Floyd, companies fell all over themselves to embrace Black causes. Some actions were gestures that cost nothing, like music streaming services observing a period of silence. Content companies pledged to increase their programming for, by and about Black people. Many businesses made pledges to diversify hiring, especially in their executive ranks.
But the evidence so far shows little progress on these pledges. Netflix, the once unstoppable juggernaut that seemed likely to eat Hollywood for breakfast, is an interesting case in point. As its growth has slowed and the political climate has changed, it reportedly shelved a plan to produce an anti-racist video series. A look at its published diversity and inclusion track record shows a small decline in the proportion of Black employees generally and executives in particular.
Thomas Frank, a historian and journalist who has chronicled the culture wars for decades, told me that he "always suspected that the backlash politics that rolled over the country in the late '60s and all through the 1970s came, at least in part, from the way commercial culture rubbed the noses of Middle America in coolness and in Middle America's own inadequacy and uncoolness. But the political backlash that resulted didn't hurt the corporations at all -- on the contrary, they eventually just changed their marketing approach to fit the new mood and then entered a golden age with Reagan and the 1980s."
The center left has been lulled by its seeming cultural power, which buttresses the belief that progress is inevitable if the time frame is elongated enough. In a world with "RuPaul's Drag Race," "How could we be talking about locking up drag queens?" we gasp.
The deeper problem is that our politics is not responsive to people's preferences. Our systems of government increasingly favor electoral minorities -- like gerrymandered state legislatures in a polarized environment -- rather than common-sense compromise. This leads to ideological zealotry. There are almost no checks on a state legislature bent on maximum cruelty.
In this atmosphere it is not that surprising that progressive consumers have turned to corporations to be a mirror of their concerns. Despite clear majority support for abortion rights and L.G.B.T.Q. rights, we are tilting ever more toward a system that allows a fanatical minority to impose its views as law. It's easier for us to hold corporations accountable than politicians. We make decisions about how to spend our money every day. Best-case scenario is you vote in new officials every couple of years.
But woke capitalism is a paper tiger. Companies embrace identity and cultural inclusion as a way to expand their market share to new communities while obscuring their raw political power and the ruthless underpinning realities of shareholder capitalism. Elites on the right, meanwhile, know very well that it is a paper tiger but are more than happy to play along with a shuck and jive that allows them to wield "woke" as a cudgel against the left -- and for some voters, it does the vital job of stoking resentment.
Following the dictates of plain old capitalism, Spotify choosing to stand by Joe Rogan, once the company had signed him up as an exclusive podcaster, was a good business decision. But the decision also made business sense for other reasons. It meant that if a right-wing mob came for queer programming on the platform, the company could point to that decision as it defends hosting podcasts that my colleagues made, stuff like "The Two Princes," a fantasy show for kids about two princes who fall in love, and "Gay Pride & Prejudice," a modern take on the Jane Austen classic. A simple policy of consistency about free speech within defined limits rather than appeals to the extremes of the culture wars is, frankly, better for everyone.
Above all, these partisan spats over politics and business serve as a useful reminder for everyone across the political spectrum: Corporations are not your friends. They do not represent your interests. Yield to their power at your own peril.

Watch Out for the Fake Tom Cruise: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In the 2002 movie "Simone," Al Pacino plays a director whose star, played by Winona Ryder, walks out on him after saying her trailer on set isn't grand enough.
Disgusted, Pacino's character secretly creates an obedient computer-generated actress to replace his temperamental one. Simone is a perfect-looking blonde, named after the computer program that crafted her, Simulation One.
But Simone is so successful -- lavished with Oscars, adored by fans -- that she overshadows her director, who becomes jealous and gets rid of her with a computer virus. But he has made her so realistic, he is charged with her murder.
Be careful what you wish for, Hollywood studios, as you mess with the primal force of A.I.
Tinseltown is going dark, as the actors join the writers on the picket line. Hollywood's century-old business model was upended by Covid and also by streaming, which swept in like an occupying army. Then streaming hit a ceiling, and Netflix and Co. scrambled to pivot.
With a dramatically different economic model shaped by transformative technologies -- A.I. is a key issue in the strike -- the writers and actors want a new deal. And they deserve it.
The Times's Brooks Barnes describes the mood of the town as très French Revolution, with writers and actors seething in fury over the Marie Antoinette antics of C.E.O.s and studio chiefs collecting humongous paychecks, frolicking in Cannes and jetting to Sun Valley.
Besides pay fairness, writers want to make sure that they're not rendered irrelevant by algorithms, and actors want to prevent their digital likenesses from coming under new ownership.
It's a complex issue. Even as writers are demanding that studios not replace them with A.I., some studio execs are no doubt wondering if the writers are being hypocritical: Will they start using A.I. to help them finish their scripts on deadline?
Chatbots are so proficient -- and growing more so every second -- that many studio suits are probably itching to bypass the middleman screenwriter.
As Puck's Matthew Belloni said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," "You can say, you know, 'Here's the "Social Network" script. Write me a script, but make it about Elon Musk, not Mark Zuckerberg."'
Jaron Lanier, the father of virtual reality, has long warned that we were cruising for a bruising. As he told me nine years ago, the lords of the cloud were acting as if they had been inventing a digital brain when what they were really doing was making a mash-up of real brains.
He said that when machines translated one language into another, they were leeching from human translators, taking matching phrases from aggregated data; those translators should have the right to negotiate for compensation for unwittingly feeding the A.I. brain.
He also has made the point that Facebook and other social media companies have been extracting our precious data for years, without giving us payment or any of the other rights a first-class citizen would normally have. He said it would be unfair if Hollywood studios created fake versions of actors and then didn't pay them.
The compensation issue is now center stage. Sarah Silverman joined class-action lawsuits against OpenAI and Meta accusing them of copyright infringement, saying that they "ingested" her work to train their A.I.s.
The ingesting and synthesizing of words, images and music is going on in giant gulps. Indeed, the day is fast approaching when the digerati will be able to make a whole fake movie.
As Lanier said, "They might say, 'Make me a movie that's similar to Tom Cruise's "Mission: Impossible." However, make sure that none of the synthetic actors can be mistaken for known actors and make sure that we're not going to get sued, but let's go right up to the line.' That's not quite feasible today, but I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be. It's just math. And we can do it."
He said that the Hollywood strikers are just the tip of the iceberg. "People say, 'Why should we help these fancy, lefty, very well-paid actors? Screw them.' But if you're making a living driving a vehicle or working in a place where you use heavy machines like an auto body shop, all kinds of jobs, this is going to create the legal precedents that could protect you in the future, too." Almost nobody is immune to the risk that A.I. could devalue their economic position, even though A.I. will also have widespread benefits.
"Tech companies would be helped by bringing the whole society into the process of improving how models perform using economic incentives," Lanier said. But, he added, if we get it wrong on "data dignity," society will "turn into a misery fast enough."
"This is really for everybody," he said of the effort not to be swallowed by A.I. "It might not seem like it, but it really, really is."

Tubi Is Rewriting the Rules of Black Indie Movies: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In genre films like "Cinnamon" and "Murder City," new voices are delivering genuine thrills with a loose energy and a generous sense of drama.
Over the past few years, Tubi has quietly amassed a thriving collection of Black-led independent movies. This might come as news to anyone caught in an endless scroll of Netflix offerings, but not to Tubi's loyal and growing following. These are movies that get right to the heart of the matter, like their titles: "Watch Your Back," "Murder City" and "Twisted House Sitter." In a way, they're the latest successors to basic cable thrillers, straight-to-video, Lifetime movies, and low-budget B-cinema. But they have a loose energy and generous sense of drama all their own.
"Cinnamon" is the first Tubi premiere under the banner Black Noir Cinema, an initiative led by Village Roadshow Pictures. It's a nifty standard-bearer: a gas station attendant and aspiring singer, Jodi (Hailey Kilgore), and a pickpocket, Eddie (David Iacono), team up for an inside job. The robbery becomes a self-own when someone from a local crime family -- led by Pam Grier -- gets killed in the process. They lean hard on the gas station owner, Wally (Damon Wayans), and then zero in on Jodi and Eddie.
The typical tangled tale of the get-rich-quick scheme is enhanced by some snappy setups and the bond between Jodi and Eddie, who has charm to burn. The film belongs to a general universe of indie crime capers, but the director, Bryian Keith Montgomery Jr., doesn't take the air out of the story with a knowing approach. Yet there's still room for the eccentricity of Wayans's outmatched huckster, Wally, and Grier's Mama, a taciturn kingpin who gives the go-ahead to kill with a flip of her shades.
Grier's presence evokes a whole vibrant history of Black crime dramas, and the logo for Black Noir Cinema -- featuring a gun-toting, Afro-sporting, flared-sleeve heroine in silhouette -- even seems a callback to the 1974 "Foxy Brown," in which she starred as a vigilante posing as a call girl to bust a crime ring and avenge her boyfriend's death. "Cinnamon" pays tribute to the grind -- the years just ticking away for Jodi at the gas station and Eddie in his dead-end hustles -- but this isn't the same struggle through an underworld associated with Grier's 1970s work. In a Variety interview about Black Noir Cinema, one of the film's producers looked beyond the echoes: The initiative is about creating "Black folk heroes," not recreating the blaxploitation genre.
The "Noir" in the program title suggests the doomed men in classic Hollywood thrillers who bet everything on extremely iffy schemes, and that certainly could apply to "Murder City." Mike Colter plays Neil, a cop kicked off the force and jailed for helping his debt-ridden father with a drug deal. Released from jail after a couple of years, he's trapped into working for a ruthless mob boss, Ash (Stephanie Sigman), but still thinks he can wangle his way to a windfall and win back his wife's trust. There's a harder edge to his predicament than in much of "Cinnamon" -- Ash especially is one cool customer -- and a daisy-chain of double-crosses leaves viewers guessing at Neil's chances till the final shootouts.
"Murder City" also leans into a little heartstring-pulling with Neil's efforts to resettle in his own home, where Ash has become a dubious benefactor to his wife and son. But the director, Michael D. Olmos, more often keeps up a simmering menace, deploying some noir lighting when Neil visits his father (Antonio Fargas, a "Foxy Brown" alum) in jail, and dropping the odd tough-guy one-liner exchange ("Go to hell!" "I probably will").
The "Black Noir Cinema" label shows that Tubi is doubling down on Black creators and viewers (who helped the streamer surpass the Max service in a recent measure of viewership share). But viewed against the rest of the lineup, "Murder City" suggests an aspiration to more polished and conventional versions of the shoestring productions that already flourish on Tubi. "Cinnamon" may have premiered at the Tribeca Festival, but titles like "If I Can't" have launched a thousand TikToks marveling at their go-for-broke plotting and, sometimes, their no-budget fight scenes.
"If I Can't," directed by and starring Tubi regular Mena Monroe, was recently listed as the most popular title on the streamer, probably for many of the same reasons that others might dismiss it as an over-the-top feature-length soap opera. But it also feels like an unfiltered update to a long tradition of I-will-survive melodrama: Harlem (Monroe) luxuriates in the doting treatment of her adoring husband -- a recurring theme in Tubi's assorted soon-to-be-doomed marriages -- only to see him shot to death in front of her. She manages to heal and dates a new man -- only to find herself the object of his physical and psychological abuse.
Monroe's soft-spoken manner and resilience make her a sympathetic center amid all the story's ups and downs, which include being judged by others for staying too long with her abusive boyfriend. "If I Can't" has a rolling momentum shared by many Tubi movies, cruising in and out of moments of passion, high drama and casual banter with a don't-look-back ease that can make more cautiously plotted films feel a bit arid. You will not see "If I Can't" opening the New York Film Festival, but this year's actual opener, "May December," relies on boundary-breaking melodrama and the truths that lie within.
There's also no denying the ingenuity and efficiency of another independent Tubi offering, "Locked In," from the Cleveland-based director David C. Snyder. (Tubi feels like a haven for non-Hollywood directors, with Detroit another hotbed for creation.) This 77-minute wonder starts with a puzzle -- four women wake up confined in a blue-lit basement, strangers to one another -- and unspools with the relaxed fun of a terrific bar story.
Cutaways and flashbacks link a bank heist and a man named Locke, but a lot of the fun rests on the interplay and suspicions among the foursome (Myonnah Amonie, Brittany Mayti, Buddy Vonn and the reliable scene-stealer Joi Roston). Amnesia runs rampant as they ponder what might have happened: "I have a boyfriend, but ... I don't think he crazy." The film is unpredictable but necessarily more tightly constructed than "If I Can't," which contains all the betrayals, sudden deaths and pure what-now moments often found on Tubi.
Far from everything on Tubi has the same flair, watchability, or even professional polish, as the TikTok hashtag #tubimoviesbelike attests. But as a home for independent Black filmmakers and viewers, it occupies a unique place right now. Especially when measured against the perils of one-size-fits-all studio content, the pleasures and the essential authenticity of the Tubi showcase can't be ignored.

Full text: Fran Drescher, who became a household name for her role on a 1990s sitcom, is now president of the union going on strike.
The stage was different, and so was the tone. But the voice was unmistakable.
Fran Drescher, the owner of a distinctly nasal, Queens-inflected accent, made her name in Hollywood for her starring role in the sitcom "The Nanny." On Thursday, she appeared before dozens of cameras as the president of the actors' union that voted unanimously earlier in the day to go on strike, delivering a fiery argument depicting the stakes of the decision.
"The eyes of the world and particularly the eyes of labor are upon us," Ms. Drescher said. "What happens to us is important. What's happening to us is happening across all fields of labor."
She shook her fists in indignation. "I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us!" she continued. "It is disgusting. Shame on them!"
Ms. Drescher is the latest in a long line of familiar faces -- Ronald Reagan, Patty Duke and Charlton Heston among them -- to run SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents tens of thousands of screen actors. But it amounts to a surprising plot twist in her long career.
As the Thursday news conference made clear, she is now a leading face of a resurgent labor movement nationally. How she handles it in the coming weeks, and possibly months, could help determine the fate of 160,000 actors.
The actors' strike, which will go into effect on Friday, is a crisis point for Hollywood, which had already been rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts with the rise of streaming and the steady decline of cable television and box office returns. Hollywood writers have been on strike for months, and with actors now joining them -- the first time since 1960 that both are on strike at the same time -- the industry will essentially grind to a halt.
Ms. Drescher, 65, has spent decades acting in Hollywood, both in television and film. Since her starring role on "The Nanny" in the 1990s, by far her most prominent role, she has appeared sporadically in television and feature films. She most recently starred in an NBC sitcom, "Indebted," which lasted 12 episodes before it was canceled in 2020.
She has long expressed concerns about corporate greed, captioning photos with slogans like "STOP CAPITALIST GREED NOW." It was enough for New York Magazine to put a headline on a 2017 blog post, "Your New Favorite Anti-Capitalist Icon Is Fran Drescher."
A few years later, in 2021, Ms. Drescher won election to the guild presidency in a deeply contested race versus the actor Matthew Modine. They represented different factions: Ms. Drescher for the establishment Unite for Strength Party, and Mr. Modine for an upstart group, Membership First.
The race become so bitter that Mr. Modine accused Ms. Drescher of spreading falsehoods about him and reportedly said: "I'm ashamed of Fran Drescher, I'm disappointed. But she'll be judged by the people in the world after she's gone, or by whatever God she worships."
Unlike the screenwriters, who have gone on strike many times over the decades and have historically been unified, actors have been known more for their intramural squabbling. Hollywood had been bracing for a writers' strike since the beginning of the year -- but few senior executives and producers were prepared for the actors to have the resolve to go through with one.
When Ms. Drescher came into power she vowed to bring the union together and to bring an end to the "dysfunctional division in this union."
When the actors agreed to a strike authorization, it was with 97.9 percent of the vote -- a stunning figure that even eclipsed the writers' significant strike authorization. Last month, Membership First, the opposition party, endorsed Ms. Drescher's re-election bid.
Still, some of her public statements and actions in recent weeks have confounded many actors.
In late June, days before the actors' contract was set to expire, Ms. Drescher and the union's lead negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, released a video that struck many viewers as surprisingly upbeat given the high stakes of the negotiations.
"I just want to assure you that we are having extremely productive negotiations that are laser-focused on all the crucial issues that you told us are most important to you," she said, wearing a military jacket. "We are standing strong, and we're going to achieve a seminal deal!"
Just days later, more than 1,000 actors, including Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence, signed a letter expressing concerns to union leadership that they were not taking into account their willingness to strike. "We hope that, on our behalf, you will meet that moment and not miss it," the letter said.
Ms. Drescher -- curiously, given her position -- added her signature to the letter.
On Monday, days before the actors' contract was set to expire, Ms. Drescher drew attention on another front: She was attending a couture Dolce & Gabbana fashion show in Puglia, Italy, where she posed for photos with Kim Kardashian. To her 362 million Instagram followers, Ms. Kardashian said of Ms. Drescher: "To my fashion icon! Always on my mood board! I seriously love this woman!"
The backlash was quick and swift. The "General Hospital" actress Nancy Lee Grahn questioned if the photo was a joke. "I'm hoping this is not true. It can't be. No one could be this stupid," she wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the actors' union said that Ms. Drescher was working as a "brand ambassador" for Dolce and Gabbana, and that the commitment was "fully known to the negotiating committee." Mr. Crabtree-Ireland called criticism of Ms. Drescher's appearance at the fashion show "outrageous" and "despicable."
Ms. Drescher addressed the issue at the news conference on Thursday. "It was absolute work," she said, adding that she continued to communicate with negotiators from abroad. "I was in hair and makeup three hours a day, walking in heels on cobblestones. Doing things like that, which is work. Not fun."
While Mr. Crabtree-Ireland spoke at the news conference from a teleprompter, Ms. Drescher spoke off the cuff.
"Wake up and smell the coffee," she said of the studios. "We demand respect! You cannot exist without us!"
"They stand on the wrong side of history at this very moment," she continued, pointing her finger forcefully toward the camera banks. "We stand in solidarity in unprecedented unity. Our union, our sister unions, and the unions around the world, are standing by us."

Full text: The difference between comedy and drama is hazier than ever, as is the future of the Emmy Awards ceremony itself.
The 2023 Primetime Emmy nominations were announced on Wednesday. James Poniewozik and Margaret Lyons, two television critics for The New York Times, discussed who made it and who didn't, the limp limited-series slate, reality TV blind spots and all those acting nominations for "Succession" and "The White Lotus."
JAMES PONIEWOZIK Weirder than usual Emmys season this year, Margaret! The writers are on strike. The actors might follow them. We don't even know when or if the actual awards show will happen. And yet the nominations have come chugging along, to remind us what TV was like when there were people making it.
Meanwhile, TV is going through a period of retrenchment, with cost-cutting at Warner Bros. Discovery and elsewhere. So however credible the Emmys are as an award, they could make a bigger difference in who gets a budget and who gets the ax.
Now that I have the cheerful stuff out of the way: The TV biz may be filled with uncertainty, but I don't see a lot of big shockers among the major nominees. But I'll start with a happy surprise -- let's hear it for "Jury Duty," the sneaky faux-documentary comedy that was designed to seem neither written nor acted but that pulled off its audacious stunt on the strength of both crafts.
MARGARET LYONS It is indeed a weird time for TV! I feel like we are watching two circles in a Venn diagram drift apart: The people who care about TV and the people who make money off TV. And the Emmys are carrying on as usual like divorcing parents agreeing to be polite at their daughter's wedding, even though everyone is mad, everyone knows exactly how poorly some parties have behaved, dad wants to bring his new girlfriend, Discovery+, and also it's a cash bar.
But "Jury Duty"! I'm especially thrilled it was nominated for casting -- I'd argue that was its greatest and most essential achievement across its many successes. I did sort of chuckle, though, that it is up against "Barry" and "The Bear," shows that feel so foundationally different from an ensemble of goofy jurors that it seems outrageous for them to all be in competition.
I'm also surprised that "Atlanta" only notched one nomination (for cinematography) in its final season. But there are a lot of banner shows for whom this is their last Emmys.
PONIEWOZIK I could run through a whole list of nays and hoorays, but I want to look big picture first. A running theme in our Emmy chats lately has been how much stronger the limited-series nominees were than everything else. I do not think that's true this year! To me, "Beef" is the class of the field among what's nominated, which also includes the garish "Dahmer," the middling "Daisy Jones & the Six" and (LOL) "Obi-Wan Kenobi." None of those last few come close to "Dead Ringers," the sanguinary David Cronenberg re-imagination that was the rare case of a TV adaptation with something original to say. It got a single nod, like "Atlanta," for cinematography.
LYONS I'm with you: "Beef" is the standout in its category for me, too.
There is always some blurriness between comedy and drama, but exactly where that gray area is changes from year to year. Sometimes all the comedies are kind of bummers or many dramas are quite snappy; sometimes the length distinction feels arbitrary at best. What struck me this year is the chasm between comedy and drama in the guest performer categories -- obviously a real apples-and-oranges, but it points to a major format trend between the disciplines.
Dramas have significant "departure" episodes, exemplified by "The Last of Us," and comedies have what amounts to celebrity cameos, like Taraji P. Henson on "Abbott Elementary." "The Bear" is not a ha-ha comedy, but Jon Bernthal's nod for guest actor feels very "comedy" because of how that character operates within the fabric of the show.
PONIEWOZIK Yeah, Margaret, every Emmys these days is a pretty good argument against separate comedy and drama categories. For me, "The Diplomat" is more a comedy, yet there it is in drama. Is "Bad Sisters" more a drama than "Barry"? I guess, but you can measure the distance in millimeters.
But speaking of dramas that are among the funniest things on TV: We won't be helping our chances in Google search unless we start talking "Succession." The saga of the Roy family ends, appropriately enough, with its whole family scrapping for a limited amount of acting prizes. This time Shiv, I mean Sarah Snook, has an edge, as the only member of the clan up for best actress. (Watch out for Bella Ramsey of "The Last of Us," though. You may have a shiv but Ellie has a knife!)
If it is the year of "Succession," which Roy deserves best actor? I'm not going to shade Brian Cox--I am afraid to -- but Logan was by necessity more a supporting figure in the final season, holding sway in absentia. Between Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong I guess I slightly lean Strong, partly for how painfully he conveyed Kendall's doomed hungry ambition, partly as payback for everyone who made fun of him for taking acting seriously and correctly using the word "dramaturgically."
One thing I'm sure of is that the "Connor's Wedding" episode should (and probably will) take every category it can. But I do have to laugh at the supporting-drama-actor category: Eight nominees, all from "Succession" or "The White Lotus." There was acting going on elsewhere on TV last season, I swear it! (But congratulations in advance to Matthew Macfadyen.)
LYONS For me, best actor is Strong by a light-year -- not to put down any of the other performances, but his control of the register of Kendall's voice alone deserves an Emmy in my book. And while I know what you mean about "Succession" overload in supporting actor, going through the list of submitted roles, I'm not convinced there's someone who was clearly snubbed. Though I'm starting to worry that "For All Mankind" will never know a moment of Emmy glory ever, and that bums me out.
The Emmys have a lot of blind spots, but the refusal to engage meaningfully with reality programming drives me crazy. "Love Is Blind" is nominated over "Couples Therapy"? Come on! And in the reality competition category, what does "Alone" have to do to get a little love?
PONIEWOZIK Yup! The Emmys have come a long way -- or at least a way -- from the days of handing statues to "Modern Family" in perpetuity. But competition reality is now one of the most set-in-stone categories, and there again are "Survivor," "The Amazing Race" and "RuPaul's Drag Race." I confess I'm not up on "Alone"; I am but one man with but two eyes. But I would have loved to have seen them open the books for "The Traitors" -- like "The Mole" in a Scottish castle, with Alan Cumming hamming it up as if he were in a John Waters production of "Macbeth." (It got a single nomination, for casting.)
As everyone out there compiles their own lists of grudges, here's the standard reminder that the Emmys calendar is not the same as Regular Human Person Calendar. The eligibility period runs from June through the following May. So you've gotta have a good memory!
"The Bear," for instance, is eligible not for the just-released Season 2 (which was astounding) but for last year's Season 1 (which was perfectly good). The comedy category is full of shows nominated for seasons that are not their peak: "Abbott Elementary" (still lovable but off its Season 1 pace), "Barry" (a great achievement with some rough patches in its final run) and "Ted Lasso" (dear God).
LYONS Beyond the sometimes confusing calendar, I also want to mention the sometimes-confounding category rules. For example, "I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson" is indeed an Emmy nominee, but not in scripted variety series with "Black Lady Sketch Show" or "Saturday Night Live" -- it counts as a short form comedy, drama or variety series because its episodes are under 20 minutes. Tim Robinson is also nominated, but again, in a short form category.
So sure! To understand the Emmys is to accept their shortcomings, and to that end I'd say this feels like a quintessential selection: A few bright surprises, a few heavy hitters, some shows that are coasting on name recognition ("Wednesday," come on now) or lingering affection for previous seasons. Now we're left to wonder if the ceremony will happen and in what capacity ...
PONIEWOZIK See you in September! [Checks the headlines about the Hollywood labor negotiations.] Or much, much later!

Full text: The Suffolk County police found 10 bodies while searching for a 24-year-old aspiring actress who had disappeared in 2010. No arrest was made in connection with the killings until now.
An architect who had lived most of his life in Nassau County and worked in Manhattan was arrested on Thursday night in connection with the killings of four women near Gilgo Beach on Long Island's South Shore. The discovery of their bodies and seven others in 2010 and 2011 terrified residents and the case remained unsolved for more than a decade.
Here are the events that led up to the arrest of the architect, Rex Heuermann:
MAY 1, 2010
Shannan Gilbert disappears.
Ms. Gilbert, 24, was an aspiring actress from Jersey City, N.J., who worked as an escort. She was last seen on May 1 after a job in Oak Beach, a gated community several miles from Gilgo Beach.
DEC. 11 to 13, 2010
Four bodies are found along Ocean Parkway.
While searching for Ms. Gilbert's body, the Suffolk County police discovered four bodies over three days along Ocean Parkway between Gilgo Beach and Cedar Beach, nearby. The bodies were spread over about a quarter mile, each roughly 500 feet apart.
DEC. 14, 2010
Police suggest a serial killer may have been behind the deaths.
Richard Dormer, the commissioner of the Suffolk County Police Department, said at a news conference that it was not "a coincidence that four bodies turned up in the same location," adding that "it appears as though somebody targeted these individuals and dumped them."
Mr. Dormer said it looked as if a car had pulled up on the side of the roadway and "dumped them in the bushes." He said that "the bodies would indicate they were dumped there by the same person or persons."
DEC. 15, 2010
The four victims are all determined to be women.
Officials investigated whether two of the women could be Ms. Gilbert and Megan Waterman, 22, of Scarborough, Maine, who had advertised herself as an escort on Craigslist and was last seen leaving a hotel several miles northeast of where the bodies were found.
JAN 19, 2011
The first body is identified as Megan Waterman's.
Ms. Waterman's death was ruled a homicide.
JAN 24, 2011
The other three women are identified.
The victims were identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Conn.; Melissa Barthelemy, 24, who had been living in the Bronx but was originally from the Buffalo area; and Amber Lynn Costello, 27, who was last seen in North Babylon on Long Island.
Ms. Brainard-Barnes had been missing since July 9, 2007; Ms. Barthelemy disappeared on July 12, 2009; and Ms. Costello was last seen on Sept. 2, 2010.
The police said all of the women whose remains were found were escorts.
APRIL 4, 2011
The police find the remains of a toddler.
While searching for Ms. Gilbert's body, investigators found the remains of eight women and one man in his late teens or early 20s, who the authorities said was wearing women's clothing and appeared to have died a violent death.
On April 4, they found the body of a toddler. The little girl's body had been hidden in a thicket of branches and poison ivy off Ocean Parkway. She was between 18 months and 24 months old at the time of her death.
DEC 13, 2011
After finding a total of 10 bodies, police announce they have discovered Ms. Gilbert's remains.
Law enforcement officials said they had found the "skeletal remains" of Ms. Gilbert. Officials said they thought Ms. Gilbert had drowned while trying to reach the parkway after knocking on a door in Oak Beach.
NOV. 12, 2016
A docuseries about serial killings airs an episode about the deaths on A&E.
"The Killing Season," an eight-episode series, was created by the filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Rachel Mills. The series, which also examines deaths in places like New Jersey, Florida and New Mexico, wasn't the first to delve into the killings: A&E broadcast "The Long Island Serial Killer" in 2011, and in 2016, the network Investigation Discovery began a series, "People Magazine Investigates," with a two-hour installment on the case. Years later, in 2020, Netflix released a film called "Lost Girls" about the case, which was based on Robert Kolker's book "Lost Girls: An Unsolved American Mystery."
JAN. 16, 2020
Officials release the first major clue about the possible killer in nearly a decade.
Investigators showed a photograph of a piece of evidence collected at the beginning of the investigation: a black leather belt, embossed with a pair of letters about half an inch tall that officials believed spelled out the initials "W.H." or "H.M." Officials said they thought the belt was handled by the suspect. The police also created a website with information about the case where people could leave tips.
JULY 13, 2023
Rex Heuermann is arrested in Midtown Manhattan.
A bail application prosecutors filed in Suffolk County Court in Riverhead said Mr. Heuermann had been charged with first degree murder in three of the killings: those of Ms. Waterman, Ms. Costello and Ms. Barthelemy. He was named as the prime suspect in the death of Ms. Brainard-Barnes.
Mr. Heuermann pleaded not guilty.

Gotta Save the Castle? Start a Podcast.: [Style Desk]

Full text: Last month, Emma, Duchess of Rutland, sat in her drawing room and weighed the pros and cons of living over the shop. Specifically, Belvoir Castle, a stately and splendid pile perched on a wooded hilltop in the English countryside with more than 356 rooms and soaring neo-Gothic towers and turrets. It has been the site of the family seat since the 16th century.
"Well, it is magnificent, of course, and we are incredibly lucky, but you never quite know who is in here with you," she said. "There isn't privacy in the way most people might expect from their homes. And don't get me started on the ghosts."
A private secretary wandered by with a giant flag that needed repair before it could fly from the castle's two-and-a-half-acre roof. Downstairs, the castle tearoom hummed with tables of tourists sampling scones with jams from the Belvoir estate. Nearby, a platoon of pickup trucks bounced across a field packing up obstacles from a recent Tough Mudder endurance event. For the duchess, born Emma Watkins, it was a day like any other.
A farmer's daughter from the Welsh borders, she moved to Belvoir in 2001 when her husband became the 11th Duke of Rutland, one of the most senior hereditary titles in England. He may have inherited a fairy-tale castle, but they were also landed with 12 million pounds (almost $ 15.5 million) of inheritance taxes and, in her words, "battalions of rats and staff who clearly preferred the former incumbents to us."
In the years since, as both chatelaine and chief executive, the duchess has brokered filming and event deals, streamlined the operations of the estate and undertaken a costly restoration to safeguard Belvoir for the next generation.
Recently, despite tabloid scrutiny for her unconventional living arrangements (the duke and duchess are legally separated and have lived in different wings since 2012) and the fact that Britain's historic houses are increasingly part of a brewing culture war over how the country should reckon with its colonial past, the duchess has displayed a growing taste for the limelight, albeit on her terms.
In 2020, she started a podcast, "Duchess," in which she interviews other duchesses. A Duchess Gallery shop on the estate sells branded clothing, home wares, gins, wines and cider. And last year the duchess published "The Accidental Duchess," an autobiography that includes candid accounts of her husband's serial affairs and her string of miscarriages while raising five children.
Now 59, she is emerging as one of the more amiable public faces of Britain's aristocracy at a time when many prefer to remain below the radar. That means she is more sanguine than most about airing dirty laundry.
Brisk but friendly, she crossed her bare, toned legs (she said she runs about two miles each day after a cup of Earl Grey tea at sunrise) as she recalled an early morning attempt to put a load of clothes into the washing machine. Her utility room, she said, is on the other side of a landing from her living quarters, which are concealed from the public by screens. She wore what she described as "a granny nightie" as she nipped across the hall.
"To my horror, there were 20 or 30 mesmerized Texans from a coach tour all pointing at me from a staircase," she said. She smiled and stroked the duke's little Shih Tzu, Spitfire, who was resting in her lap with a resigned air.
"There is always something happening here," she said. "We do what we need to do to keep the lights on."
Belvoir, Pronounced 'Beaver'
It is an idiosyncratic -- and fiercely protected -- quirk of the British cultural landscape that so many of its stately homes can have visitors even while the families that own them remain in residence. About one-third of the historic houses are in the care of conservation charities like the National Trust or English Heritage, but Belvoir Castle, in Leicestershire, remains in private hands.
"Many houses opened up for the first time after the Second World War, when new income streams needed to be found to meet repair bills and when houses were being knocked down because owners could no longer manage to keep them," said Ben Cowell, the director general of Historic Houses, a nonprofit that helps preserve about 1,500 privately owned properties.
Starting in the 1970s, changing laws about inheritance taxes made it fiscally advantageous to open up houses to the public for a certain number of days each year, generating funds for eye-watering preservation costs. (Today, Historic Houses estimates its properties have, collectively, a roughly £2 billion (about $ 2.5 billion) repair and maintenance backlog.)
"We find that visitors really love seeing houses that remain lived-in homes, as opposed to being museum pieces where nobody now lives," Mr. Cowell said.
At Belvoir, some even stay the night. The castle, which was a stand-in for Windsor Castle in "The Crown" and has been featured in movies including "The Da Vinci Code" and "The Young Victoria," often hosts guests for weekend events and photo shoots. They can stay in sumptuous state bedrooms, several of which are newly renovated, including one that, in collaboration with de Gournay, is covered in hand-painted wallpapers. (Belvoir wallpapers are, naturally, available to order.)
In fact, wallpaper preservation is often a priority for the duchess, a onetime interior decorator (and real estate agent and opera singer). It is a cornerstone of her new charitable initiative, American Friends of Belvoir Castle, which will host an inaugural fund-raising gala at the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., next year.
An American reverence for Britain's grand houses, spurred by the popularity of shows like "The Crown" and "Downton Abbey," has been important for the castle coffers. After all, Belvoir -- pronounced "beaver" -- costs about £1 million a year to run "just standing still," the duchess said. She is always looking for donors.
"Americans love to trace their roots and the sense of history we have here," she said. "It has been simply wonderful to have so many listeners from there for 'Duchess."'
Ah yes, the "Duchess" podcast. Meghan Markle is not the only duchess in the podcast game. (A biography of the Duchess of Sussex sat on an ottoman in the family drawing room at Belvoir.)
But why would the Duchess of Rutland, who said she didn't even know what a podcast was until the idea was presented to her, agree to interview other women who run stately homes, including Lady Henrietta Spencer Churchill of Blenheim Palace and the Duchess of Argyll of Inveraray Castle and Countess Spencer of Althorp House? Was she not worried that a project with such an unashamedly niche and elitist focus could backfire? The duchess looked shocked at the suggestion.
"Not for a moment," she said. "People can like me or hate me, but I have never been one to dwell on others' negativity. 'Duchess' was about giving people a glimpse behind the scenes of what it's like to be a woman running one of these properties. And the fact that it can be jolly hard work. I don't think I've had breakfast in bed once in the two decades I've lived here."
The podcast was the brainchild of the duchess's oldest daughter, Lady Violet Manners, who came up with the idea while studying at U.C.L.A. Violet, her mother said, felt sure there was an audience for such a series. The duchess, who is an adept interviewer, cast herself in the mold of "upmarket showgirl," she said, happy to come on and do her bit.
Lady Violet found inspiration for the podcast from years of listening to after-dinner conversation between duchesses as they sat by the Belvoir fire, swapping recommendations for curtain makers and stonemasons or tips on what to do when a flood happens or a ceiling caves in. What struck the duchess when recording the podcasts was that many of the women, or "girls," as she called them, were of a similar mind-set. Namely, that they were custodians of personal and collective monuments to important national history and were largely unafraid to get their hands dirty.
"I also realized that the British aristocracy have been rather practical at picking the right sort of wife they needed at a particular time, which is partly why they've kept going for generations," the duchess said. Sorts like an artistic visionary or an American heiress. Or someone like her.
"I was raised on a farm," she said. "I didn't come with a title or know a thing about the worlds of heritage or class, but I will do everything I possibly can for Belvoir to thrive for as long as I'm here."
Not Without Its Complications
Some of these efforts have gone above and beyond what many would be prepared to do. In her autobiography, the duchess describes weeping while breastfeeding her son Charles, the Belvoir heir, when she realized for the first time the duke had been unfaithful. At his 1920s-themed 50th birthday party in 2009, she had a similar revelation, and the moment, she wrote, left her "feeling as if I'd been punched and fighting for breath."
She locked herself in the state dining room to smoke cigarettes, drink wine and dance (alone) to "I Will Survive." A divorce lawyer told her she could expect to walk away with £30 million, she said. But she chose to stay, the duke residing in the Shepherds' Tower and the duchess in the Nursery Wing.
"It's a very modern arrangement, yet very French 18th century at the same time," Nicky Haslam, the interior designer and socialite, said in an article in Vanity Fair. The duke, a vocal fan of Donald Trump and Brexit who has written several books on subjects like naval history, has lived at the castle with various partners in the years since the separation. For the last decade, the duchess has been in a relationship with Phil Burtt, the estate manager.
"It's not without its complications, but when is anything perfect?" said the duchess, who said she had a breakdown in 2017 when she walked across the castle to her late mother-in-law's bedroom and didn't emerge for months. She stressed that she was "much better" now and that crystals, reiki and meditation had all helped. And, she said, she and the duke were "on the same page," with a friendship and a deal in place that will allow her to remain at Belvoir as chief executive until she is 65. They even share the occasional supper together.
"Money is not my God," she said. "How awful it would be to go down in history as the person who caused this place to be broken up after hundreds of years."
The duchess still believes in primogeniture, or the right of succession belonging to the firstborn son, and doesn't think that her other four children would want the burden of such an inheritance anyway. Lady Violet, Lady Alice and Lady Eliza, once known as the beautiful "bad-Manners sisters" on account of London parties so raucous that their neighbors complained to the newspapers, are now working in creative consultancy, styling and interior design, while Charles works in the City of London and his brother Hugo attends Newcastle University.
And while she has loved working on the podcast, the duchess said, she is now handing over the reins to Lady Violet for the next series, which begins Aug. 17 and features custodians of historic houses presenting individual episodes themselves. The duchess wants to focus on the estate's commercial enterprises, including a retail village and farm, as well as a new YouTube series that delves into the history of Belvoir, rather than houses elsewhere.
Perhaps building a multiplatform social media following was part and parcel with being a successful 21st-century duchess?
"Oh no, no, I don't think so," the duchess said. "Most of the girls I interviewed probably think 'Oh no, what on earth is she doing now?' Putting yourself out there and talking about money can still be seen by much of the British aristocracy with an eye roll. But I just do the work and keep going. I know why I do what I do."

Full text: With her first brick-and-mortar bakery, Justice of the Pies, the pastry chef Maya-Camille Broussard focuses on creativity -- and inclusivity for people with disabilities.
The South Side of Chicago brims with inimitable African American culture and history, and the pastry chef Maya-Camille Broussard is adding her brand of sweetness to the place where she was born and raised. In June, Ms. Broussard opened the first brick-and-mortar store of her longtime delivery and wholesale pie business, Justice of the Pies.
The shop, in a former dentist's office in Avalon Park, one of the South Side's many historic, predominantly African American neighborhoods, serves Ms. Broussard's inventive pies and pastries, such as her calling cards -- a blue cheese praline pear pie and a strawberry basil Key lime pie -- along with unorthodox items like her salted caramel peach pie and a deep-dish chilaquiles quiche.
Recipe: Strawberry Basil Key Lime Pie
Ms. Broussard, who lost 75 percent of her hearing in a childhood accident, may be the industry's most prominent hard-of-hearing Black pastry chef. She has gained a following for her pies through social media, pop-ups and appearances on the Netflix competition show "Bake Squad." "I realized that being a member of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community actually gave me a superpower," she said, "and that superpower includes a heightened sense of smell and taste."
Ms. Broussard chose her bakery's location in hopes of encouraging other chefs and entrepreneurs to join her. "I want to force people who don't look like me to come to the South Side if they want my pies," she said. "I want to force people to come to a neighborhood that deserves private investment, a neighborhood that has a blighted corridor, a neighborhood that has empty storefronts."
Zella Palmer, an author and professor at Dillard University in New Orleans who grew up on the South Side of Chicago, said neighborhoods like Avalon Park deserve more inventive Black-owned businesses. "There's a huge pride in the community to see this gleaming pie shop," she said. "This is a pie shop that looks like it could be in Brooklyn, or on Magazine Street in New Orleans, but it's here."
Several of the shop's counters are 32 inches high, meeting the height standards of the American Disabilities Act and making them accessible for wheelchair users. Each section of the shop has a different floor tile texture, which helps patrons with limited sight who use a walking cane navigate the store.
"How can I be an ambassador for people living with disabilities and have a space that isn't accessible?" she said. Signs in the shop carry Braille inscriptions, and language is designed to be inclusive, too. (In the bathroom, there are "personal hygiene products" rather than "feminine hygiene products.") A service door that has a bell and a flashlight allows Ms. Broussard to remain aware of important deliveries.
Ms. Broussard started Justice of the Pies in 2014, naming it for her father, Stephen Broussard, a criminal-justice lawyer and longtime activist. She had a complicated relationship with him and has sought healing through the bakery. Mr. Broussard displayed a predilection for pies, convincing a young Ms. Broussard -- an initial skeptic -- to give them a chance.
For several years, she operated in different businesses and spaces, while also creating programs to address food insecurity, including teaching young people on the South Side what she describes as "self-sufficiency" skills, such as how to budget, make a grocery list and follow a recipe.
Ms. Broussard communicates by reading lips, which requires a level of effort that can slow down her pie-baking process. To keep up with demand, the pastry chef keeps her head down while working, and hears ambient sound rather than what a person might be saying to her, leading some customers to think she was ignoring them. (One even stormed out, swearing at her before leaving.)
She is eager to push the boundaries with her new menu, which will debut in full in September. She talks about including items beyond her pies to round it out -- like the lunchroom cookie, her play on a buttery sugar cookie once served in the city's public schools. She's tinkering with a tuna melt with sun-dried tomatoes, fig jam, olives and Manchego.
"When people are willing to play with me and engage with what I'm creating, it makes me feel good because it's like 'OK, I'm doing something crazy, but it's working."'

During a Strike, a Hollywood Diner Becomes a Different Kind of Writers' Room: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In their third month on the picket lines, Los Angeles screenwriters are drawing inspiration -- and sustenance -- from a local restaurant as their industry faces pressures from changing viewer habits.
They are usually fresh off the picket lines when they sink into plaid booths behind red Formica tables, or pull up to the terrazzo countertop, not far from the jukebox that switches from Sam Cooke to Joan Jett.
The room rumbles with their chatter, their laughter. Their emergency savings are dwindling, but hey, sitting together over free milkshakes and tuna melts, things don't feel so bad.
Such is the daily scene at Swingers, a beloved retro diner in Los Angeles where the lunch and dinner crowds are dominated by Hollywood writers still on strike.
For more than two months, they have fought studios for better wages and job security, and there is no hint of an agreement on the horizon. And yet, spirits are high.
"This is the time you would think things would be petering out, people would be getting tired," said Scott Saltzburg, a writer for the game show "Weakest Link" on NBC who tucked into a corner table on a recent weekday with a friend. "And I don't see that at all."
Since early May, 11,500 screenwriters have been on strike against Hollywood studios and entertainment companies in a battle for higher pay and better working conditions. Writers say their industry has increasingly become a gig economy, in which they are forced to string together income with side hustles. Those in the lowest-paid tier take on dog-sitting and delivery jobs to make ends meet.
Writers say they are frustrated at being slowly edged out of a changing industry. The Writers Guild of America has warned that the profession is at stake, as fewer episodes of each show are ordered, writers' rooms shrink and companies like Netflix and Amazon limit their residual payments. The writers also want restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence.
For their part, major-studio executives are facing a business model in crisis, as viewing habits and advertisers shift away from broadcast and cable networks. Streaming services have continued to lose money, and executives say there is little room in the situation for raises.
"In some ways, the W.G.A. has caught management at an awkward moment," said Jonathan Kuntz, a retired film historian who taught at the School of Theater, Film and Television at the University of California, Los Angeles. "It's not a time when they're feeling rich and fat and sassy and might be willing to share. Instead, there's great upheaval, and we've seen layoffs and cutbacks."
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios' interests, points to the high salaries that writers can already reach and says that companies have offered outsized wage and residual increases. The alliance has resisted the union's proposal for a minimum number of writers on staff for shows, saying that would be a hiring quota that does not align with the creative process.
Most productions in Los Angeles have been disrupted by picketing writers. Other trades that serve the industry -- the caterers, costumers, prop houses -- are sympathetic, but hurting.
"It's been really tough -- it's so slow, and there's nothing going on," said Dan Schultz, vice president of Prop Heaven in Burbank. "We're an ancillary business, and things roll downhill. We're at the bottom of that hill."
Mr. Schultz said the prop house had lost at least 80 percent of its business because of the strike. Requests for props for live events or commercials have helped, but there is no pivot that can make up for regular production work. For now, the company's 28 employees focus on in-house projects like cleaning up and organizing areas of the showroom.
At Western Costume, which has outfitted actors in films for more than a century, the 120,000-square-foot warehouse full of rentals has had little traffic lately.
"When we're busy, it's like a train station -- there's a constant flow of customers coming in and out," said Gilbert Moussally, vice president of costume operations. "There's almost zero at this point."
During the 2007 writers' strike, the California economy lost $ 2.1 billion, according to one estimate. The hardship could intensify if the actors also go on strike after their contract with the studios expires Wednesday night.
The current writers' strike is expected to last longer than the 100-day walkout in 2007. Many writers said that guild members seem particularly determined, and that morale is much higher this time around. At picket lines across the city, there are theme days (think cosplay or Beyoncé), television-show reunions, karaoke Fridays. Guild members are drawing support from social media, and strike captains have been flooded with donations of beverages, snacks, sunscreen and food trucks.
And there are free burgers and fries at Swingers, an institution that has always drawn industry regulars.
Drew Carey -- the actor, comedian and game-show host -- is currently paying back the restaurant for each meal, plus tip, that is ordered by someone who flashes a Writers Guild membership card. Mr. Carey made the same grand gesture during the previous strike, one that he also extends at Bob's Big Boy in Burbank.
Each week, his tab at Swingers runs more than $ 10,000. Without it, "I'm sure we would be completely hurting, and we were, the first few weeks," said its owner, Stephanie Wilson.
The restaurant has its own Hollywood story arc: Iconic hangout where employees who are like family closes during the pandemic. Actress/waitress turned manager and mother of three scrapes together funds from relatives and friends to buy and revive the place.
Ms. Wilson, 41, now oversees a main hub of the strike. "Writers are, I think, kind of the backbone of it all," she said.
By early evening on a Monday night, the diner's servers had changed shifts, but the clatter of plates and glasses had not paused. The sun's last rays lingered on tables where customers squinted at the light.
Sitting across from her husband and collaborator, Anya Meksin attempted to finish her chopped salad while keeping their 2-year-old son from climbing over the top of the booth. The family has been coming to the diner at least twice a week, trying to stretch the savings they are relying on.
Just before the strike, Ms. Meksin, 41, was hired for "High Potential," a new detective series on ABC. But the work won't start until after the union has a contract.
The free dinners and the chance to be around people in similar situations has become her comfort zone.
"It feels," she said, "like a union mess hall."

CHICAGO — The South Side of Chicago brims with inimitable African American culture and history, and pastry chef Maya-Camille Broussard is adding her brand of sweetness to the place where she was born and raised. In June, Broussard opened the first brick-and-mortar store of her longtime delivery and wholesale pie business, Justice of the Pies.
The shop, in a former dentist’s office in Avalon Park, one of the South Side’s many historic, predominantly African American neighborhoods, serves Broussard’s inventive pies and pastries, such as her calling cards — a blue cheese praline pear pie and a strawberry basil Key lime pie — along with unorthodox items like her salted caramel peach pie and a deep-dish chilaquiles quiche.

Strawberry Basil Key Lime Pie
Recipe from Maya-Camille Broussard
Adapted by Kayla Stewart
A night of cocktails inspired Maya-Camille Broussard’s strawberry basil Key lime pie, a signature pie at her Chicago pastry shop, Justice of the Pies. After tasting a vodka cocktail with puréed basil, lime and bell pepper crafted by her cousin Peter, the pastry chef recreated the mixture as a pie filling, nixing the bell pepper, adding juice from Key limes and balancing the sublimely sour taste with the creamy sweetness of condensed milk. If strawberries are out of season, you may top the pie with macerated strawberries for an additional dose of sweetness.
Yield: One 9-inch pie
Total time: 45 minutes, plus 6 hours’ cooling
Ingredients:
For the graham cracker crust:
1 3/4 packed cups (227 grams) graham cracker crumbs
1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup (113 grams) unsalted butter, melted
For the filling:
2 cups (54 grams) fresh basil leaves
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup (240 grams) fresh lime juice, preferably from Key limes
1 (14-ounce/397-gram) can sweetened condensed milk
4 large egg yolks
For topping:
1 pound strawberries, hulled and quartered or thinly sliced lengthwise
Preparation:
1. Prepare the crust: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar and melted butter until there are no dry crumbs visible.
2. Transfer the crumbs to a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan and tamp down so that the crumbs form a solid layer across the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Bake until set and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool completely.
3. Meanwhile, prepare the filling: In a blender, combine the basil, olive oil and 2 tablespoons lime juice. Using a silicone spatula, press the basil toward the bottom to compress the leaves, then pulse to blend the mixture. Add 2 more tablespoons lime juice, scrape down the sides of the blender and press the mixture back down. Blend on high speed until emulsified.
4. In a large bowl, whisk the basil purée and sweetened condensed milk until evenly light green. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. While whisking, slowly pour in the remaining 3/4 cup lime juice, then continue to whisk until blended. The mixture will begin to thicken as the acids in the juice react with the proteins in the condensed milk. Allow the mixture to stand for 5 minutes to thicken even more.
5. Set the crust on a baking sheet and pour in the filling. Smooth the top. Bake until tiny bubbles emerge on the surface, about 15 minutes.
6. Cool the pie to room temperature, then refrigerate, uncovered, until set and thoroughly chilled, at least 6 hours. You can refrigerate the pie in a cake box for up to 7 days or freeze for up to 2 months. (Remove the pie from the freezer and allow it to stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.)
7. When ready to serve, top slices of pie with the strawberries.

Dangerous Work but Little Help For Women Selling Real Estate: [National Desk]

Full text: Most sexual harassment comes from potential clients, and agents say they are vulnerable to abuse in an industry that offers few protections.
Sara Ghodsi sold auto parts before moving to San Diego and becoming a real estate agent. She didn't have to sit in an office all day, made a good income and had the freedom to work on her own schedule, all of which she enjoyed.
But Ms. Ghodsi also understood it was a very competitive field as the number of agents across the country swelled to a record high. So when a homeowner in the coastal town of Oceanside, Calif., called and said he would consider selling, Ms. Ghodsi, eager to find a property for her client during the pandemic, agreed to meet him at his condominium -- alone.
As they talked that afternoon in August 2021, the man began inching his chair closer to hers. Then he reached out, groped her thigh and forcefully kissed her.
"I kind of blacked out a little," said Ms. Ghodsi, 37. "I was trying to be calm and collected because I was by myself in a stranger's house. The door was maybe five feet away, but I had no idea what this guy was capable of doing."
Across the nation, the overwhelming majority of real estate agents are women -- and they are vulnerable to abuse in an industry that offers few protections, demands that they meet clients alone in empty homes and encourages them to use their appearance to help bring in buyers. Reports of harassment and occasionally physical violence, including rape and even murder, highlight the risks they face.
The National Association of Realtors reports that 66 percent of their members are women. Many were attracted to the field for the same reasons as Ms. Ghodsi: flexible schedules, a workplace that's almost entirely remote and a licensing process that can be completed in as little as a few weeks.
But the industry is also structured so that 90 percent of agents are not actually employees of the agencies they work with. They are independent contractors, which means they are not protected under Title VII -- the federal law that prohibits discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.
It also means that many real estate agencies that rely on these agents for the vast majority of their income do not feel obligated -- or even inclined -- to offer them any kind of institutional protection or training. For most of the women out there, it is up to them to come up with safety strategies like sharing their location with a family member or friend, insisting on references before meeting a client -- or even carrying a firearm for protection.
And so, nearly six years after the #MeToo movement ignited a global reckoning about sexual harassment and assault, hundreds of thousands of women across the country are working in an industry that resists new measures to protect the women in its ranks.
"That world is pretty much the wild, wild west," said Kimberly Perlin, a complex trauma therapist in Towson, Md., who has treated several real estate agents who were sexually assaulted at work. "Anybody can call up and say they have money and want a house, including sexual predators. And in a house, you have an unattended space, and an inherent power balance, because the salesperson wants the sale and the buyer knows it."
The National Association of Realtors, a trade organization representing 1.5 million members, has been resistant to require any sort of safety training of its members.
Classes in its Realtor safety program, which includes webinars on best practices for safety, remain optional. On the group's website, the program makes safety a matter of personal precautions, advising agents to avoid showing houses after dark and always ensure that properties have reliable cellphone service.
"It's hard to force people to take certain things," said Tracy Kasper, president-elect of the National Association of Realtors, of safety training. "Could that become part of what we make mandatory? It could. Have we done it yet? No we haven't."
Agents say the solution requires industrywide buy-in, and some recommended universal background checks for buyers and making mandatory safety trainings a contingency for all brokerages' memberships in trade organizations. Others suggested that female agents have an option to ask for an escort when client meetings feel unsafe, with their brokerages covering the cost.
Ms. Ghodsi began carrying a Taser gun after her encounter. She filed a police report, but declined to press charges against her aggressor. "I just wanted it on file," she said, "so it's on record."
It continues to affect both her mental health and her career.
"I feel like I haven't been able to do my job to my full potential like I was before, because I'm scared," she said.
Younger agents, and those new to the profession, are not always aware of the dangers.
"I never thought about it when I was starting out," said Rachel DiSalvo, 41, who has been selling homes in New York and New Jersey for 12 years. "I would meet strangers at vacant homes at night."
She has faced both sexual harassment while on the job -- buyers making innuendos or attempting to grope her -- as well as violence. One seller, angry she hadn't secured him a higher price, took out an ax in front of her and proceeded to attack the lawn sign that bore her picture.
"I didn't know what to do so I just tried to keep calm," she said of the incident. "He was screaming and yelling. In the industry, we call it a 'mantrum."'
Surveys by industry groups have found that harassment in the industry is commonplace, with most real estate agents reporting that they had either personally experienced or witnessed sexual harassment in the workplace.
Working with house flippers, when homes sit vacant for prolonged periods, has also presented her with risks. In November, a squatter laid claim to a recently renovated home that she was trying to sell, and after she asked him to leave the property, he began calling her cellphone -- the number was on the lawn's "For Sale" sign -- at all hours, threatening to have her killed.
She got the police involved, and eventually had him evicted from the property.
Ms. DiSalvo now has an alarm button on her phone and keeps pepper spray in her car, which she takes into properties whenever she feels uneasy. She always shares her live location with friends or family when going to showings. But she is aware of the industry's Catch-22: Every time she asks a new client to provide identification before meeting, or refuses to set a meeting after dark, she knows they might just opt to go with another agent.
"We don't have an HR department," she said. "If someone does harass you, and you complain about it, you basically lose the opportunity to make that commission."
Ms. DiSalvo is an independent contractor currently working with a Keller Williams brokerage in New Jersey. She notifies the brokerage every time she faces an uncomfortable incident. That follows protocol.
"Keller Williams's policies and guidelines encourage employees and agents who believe they have been harassed in the workplace to promptly report those facts to their franchisee's management," said Darryl Frost, a spokesman for Keller Williams, who added that management is also required to investigate. But while Ms. DiSalvo has always felt that she receives a sensitive ear, little action follows.
After the squatter threatened her, she was left on her own to coordinate with the police. And at a previous brokerage, it was suggested a male colleague step in to close a deal after she was verbally harassed by the client. But that meant Ms. DiSalvo paid the male agent a referral fee out of her own commission.
"There is no scenario in which the brokerage gets involved unless the police report comes to them directly," she said. "In 12 years, I have always been the one problem-solving in these scenarios."
Agents also know that their physical appearance is linked to their success.
One need only watch an episode of "Selling Sunset," Netflix's hit reality show following a group of high-earning female agents, to get the connection: the higher the hemlines and the stilettos, it seems the higher the commissions, as well. Real estate agents use headshots to bring in business, because they know their physical appearance is part of their brand.
"It's really a double-edged sword because as a Realtor, you have to look good, be nice, and sometimes flirt with everybody to make them trust you. But that shouldn't make me a target," said Ms. Ghodsi.
Yet the very nature of their jobs -- often meeting strangers to woo them into buying property -- exposes real estate agents to danger. Those in the industry are well aware of high profile murders: One agent was killed showing a million-dollar home in 2008 in British Columbia; another was gunned down outside a property she was showing in Florida last year. In 2021 alone, 25 real estate professionals died from violence on the job, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Perhaps no crime sent more shock waves through the industry than the death of Beverly Carter.
Ms. Carter had just one more property to show on that September day before she could go home.
It was nearly 6 p.m., and the Arkansas real estate agent called her husband to tell him that she would be home for dinner before getting into her brown Cadillac and driving 30 minutes outside of Little Rock to show a home to a stranger.
She was never seen alive again.
Ms. Carter was 50 years old when she was murdered in 2014. Her killer, who lured her to the isolated property by pretending to be an interested buyer, kidnapped her, suffocated her and eventually buried her body in a shallow grave nearby. He later told reporters that he targeted Ms. Carter because -- like most real estate agents -- "she was a woman working alone." He was sentenced to life in prison; his wife, who served as an accomplice, received a 30-year sentence.
Her son, Carl Carter, remembers being woken by the doorbell at 4 a.m. on the Tuesday detectives found her body. She had been missing for four days and a group of his mother's colleagues, knowing that media was already camped out at the concrete plant where her body was discovered, came to his home to break the news to him personally.
"The industry is operating without guardrails," he said.
In 2017 he began the Beverly Carter Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to creating more stringent safety measures for real estate agents. The same year, he and his family filed a lawsuit against Crye-Leike Realtors, the agency for which Ms. Carter had been working as an independent contractor, alleging the firm was aware of the dangers she faced but never offered any training or safeguards to prevent them. That suit was later dismissed because of the statute of limitations.
"No comment is needed," said Harold Crye, president of Crye-Leike, in an email when contacted by a reporter about the case.
Too much onus is on individual agents to create their own safety measures, Mr. Carter said, when what is needed is industrywide reform. Rather than put protocols in place that would protect agents in the field, brokerages have been slow to respond to calls for broader reform -- or resistant all together, Mr. Carter said.
"I've been told by big-name brokerages: 'Sorry about your mom. But I'm not here to keep people safe, I'm here to make money,"' he said. "It's just very much a for-profit industry." The National Association of Realtors has made other trainings mandatory in the past: in May, after mounting pressure over discriminatory practices and appraisal bias, the organization announced that agents must now take regular continuing education classes in fair housing and diversity, equity and inclusion.
On the group's webpage, they offer safety strategy tips like "share your schedule with a colleague, assistant or family member"; "check your cellphone battery and signal before heading to an appointment" and "never go into attics, crawl spaces or garages where you could be trapped."
The organization also conducts an annual survey on safety. This year, when agents were asked if they'd been a victim of a crime while on the job, 98 percent of respondents said no. While the organization has touted those numbers as a success, Mr. Carter views them differently.
"A few percentage points out of 1.5 million suddenly becomes a really different conversation when you realize it means thousands of people have been victimized," Mr. Carter said.
Some female agents, concerned about their own personal safety, are choosing to carry handguns on the job.
Dawna Hetzler, 53, began carrying a gun on the job years ago after a friend encouraged her to get tactical training and a concealed weapon permit because she worked alone so often.
She was still arranging brochures at an open house in the Denver suburbs in August 2019 when she heard a knock at the door. The tall man with a shaved head who stood outside said he was interested in potentially buying the townhouse she was showing. She let him in, and when he asked to see the upstairs, she led him to the primary bedroom.
Then he suddenly pulled up his shirt, revealing a 12-inch knife tucked into his pants. He also reached for a canister of bear spray and doused her in the face. But that day, she had her Springfield 9-millimeter gun hidden in an ankle holster beneath her pants leg. She fired one shot, and he fled.
"He brought a knife to a gunfight," she said.
Her attacker was arrested four days later, and later sentenced to 16 years in prison.
Ms. Hetzler now offers trainings to other real estate agents, some of which involve tactical skills including headlocks as well as how to handle a gun during an attack. But carrying a weapon, she said, is a deeply personal decision.
"If you don't believe in firearms, it doesn't matter to me, there's no judgment. Just find another way to defend yourself," she said. "Nothing is worth your life, including a sale."

Sara Ghodsi sold auto parts before moving to San Diego and becoming a real estate agent. She didn’t have to sit in an office all day, made a good income and had the freedom to work on her own schedule, all of which she enjoyed.
But Ghodsi also understood it was a very competitive field as the number of agents across the country swelled to a record high. So when a homeowner in the coastal town of Oceanside, California, called and said he would consider selling, Ghodsi, eager to find a property for her client during the pandemic, agreed to meet him at his condominium — alone.
As they talked that afternoon in August 2021, the man began inching his chair closer to hers. Then he reached out, groped her thigh and forcefully kissed her.
“I kind of blacked out a little,” said Ghodsi, 37. “I was trying to be calm and collected because I was by myself in a stranger’s house. The door was maybe 5 feet away, but I had no idea what this guy was capable of doing.”
Across the nation, the overwhelming majority of real estate agents are women — and they are vulnerable to abuse in an industry that offers few protections, demands that they meet clients alone in empty homes and encourages them to use their appearance to help bring in buyers. Reports of harassment and occasionally physical violence, including rape and even murder, highlight the risks they face.
The National Association of Realtors reports that 66% of their members are women. Many were attracted to the field for the same reasons as Ghodsi: flexible schedules, a workplace that’s almost entirely remote and a licensing process that can be completed in as little as a few weeks.
But the industry is also structured so that 90% of agents are not actually employees of the agencies they work with. They are independent contractors, which means they are not protected under Title VII — the federal law that prohibits discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.
It also means that many real estate agencies that rely on these agents for the vast majority of their income do not feel obligated — or even inclined — to offer them any kind of institutional protection or training. For most of the women out there, it is up to them to come up with safety strategies like sharing their location with a family member or friend, insisting on references before meeting a client — or even carrying a firearm for protection.
And so, nearly six years after the #MeToo movement ignited a global reckoning about sexual harassment and assault, hundreds of thousands of women across the country are working in an industry that resists new measures to protect the women in its ranks.
“That world is pretty much the wild, wild west,” said Kimberly Perlin, a complex trauma therapist in Towson, Maryland, who has treated several real estate agents who were sexually assaulted at work. “Anybody can call up and say they have money and want a house, including sexual predators. And in a house, you have an unattended space, and an inherent power balance, because the salesperson wants the sale and the buyer knows it.”
The National Association of Realtors, a trade organization representing 1.5 million members, has been resistant to require any sort of safety training of its members.
Classes in its Realtor safety program, which includes webinars on best practices for safety, remain optional. On the group’s website, the program makes safety a matter of personal precautions, advising agents to avoid showing houses after dark and always ensure that properties have reliable cellphone service.
“It’s hard to force people to take certain things,” said Tracy Kasper, president-elect of the National Association of Realtors, of safety training. “Could that become part of what we make mandatory? It could. Have we done it yet? No we haven’t.”
Agents say the solution requires industrywide buy-in, and some recommended universal background checks for buyers and making mandatory safety trainings a contingency for all brokerages’ memberships in trade organizations. Others suggested that female agents have an option to ask for an escort when client meetings feel unsafe, with their brokerages covering the cost.
Ghodsi began carrying a stun gun after her encounter. She filed a police report, but declined to press charges against her aggressor. “I just wanted it on file,” she said, “so it’s on record.”
It continues to affect both her mental health and her career.
“I feel like I haven’t been able to do my job to my full potential like I was before, because I’m scared,” she said.
Younger agents, and those new to the profession, are not always aware of the dangers.
“I never thought about it when I was starting out,” said Rachel DiSalvo, 41, who has been selling homes in New York and New Jersey for 12 years. “I would meet strangers at vacant homes at night.”
She has faced both sexual harassment while on the job — buyers making innuendoes or attempting to grope her — as well as violence. One seller, angry she hadn’t secured him a higher price, took out an ax in front of her and proceeded to attack the lawn sign that bore her picture.
“I didn’t know what to do so I just tried to keep calm,” DiSalvo said of the incident. “He was screaming and yelling. In the industry, we call it a ‘mantrum’.”
Surveys by industry groups have found that harassment in the industry is commonplace, with most real estate agents reporting that they had either personally experienced or witnessed sexual harassment in the workplace.
Working with house flippers, when homes sit vacant for prolonged periods, has also presented her with risks. In November, a squatter laid claim to a recently renovated home that DiSalvo was trying to sell, and after she asked him to leave the property, he began calling her cellphone — the number on the “For Sale” sign — at all hours, threatening to have her killed.
She got the police involved, and eventually had him evicted from the property.
DiSalvo now has an alarm button on her phone and keeps pepper spray in her car, which she takes into properties whenever she feels uneasy. She always shares her live location with friends or family when going to showings. But she is aware of the industry’s Catch-22: Every time she asks a new client to provide identification before meeting, or refuses to set a meeting after dark, she knows they might just opt to go with another agent.
“We don’t have an HR department,” she said. “If someone does harass you, and you complain about it, you basically lose the opportunity to make that commission.”
DiSalvo is an independent contractor currently working with a Keller Williams brokerage in New Jersey. She notifies the brokerage every time she faces an uncomfortable incident. That follows protocol.
“Keller Williams’ policies and guidelines encourage employees and agents who believe they have been harassed in the workplace to promptly report those facts to their franchisee’s management,” said Darryl Frost, a spokesperson for Keller Williams, who added that management is also required to investigate. But while DiSalvo has always felt that she receives a sensitive ear, little action follows.

And at a previous brokerage, it was suggested a male colleague step in to close a deal after she was verbally harassed by the client. But that meant DiSalvo paid the male agent a referral fee out of her own commission.
“There is no scenario in which the brokerage gets involved unless the police report comes to them directly,” she said. “In 12 years, I have always been the one problem-solving in these scenarios.”

It's Seven Grandkids, Mr. President: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Even my Republican sister is not immune to Joe Biden's gregarious Irish charm.
She met him at media holiday parties over the years and was so impressed that she got seduced to the other side for a time, voting for the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and writing in Biden's name for president in 2012. She sent out a Christmas card one year with a picture of herself cheek to cheek with Biden -- and some of her Republican friends stopped speaking to her.
So I was surprised recently when I discovered my sister writing a letter to President Biden, a plea that she had started in the middle of the night, after mulling over the matter for quite a while.
"I watched as you told the nation that you had six grandchildren and you loved each one of them," she wrote. "I believe that. What I cannot believe and what I find unconscionable is that you refuse to admit or accept the fact that there is a beautiful little 4-year-old girl living in Arkansas by the name of Navy Joan who is your seventh grandchild."
Peggy wrote about Hunter's high-priced lawyers going down to Arkansas to make sure Navy could not use the Biden name and to slash child support payments.
"She has the Biden blood running through her veins, and all she is going to have as a reminder of this are some of Hunter's original paintings; sounds like a lousy trade-off, if you ask me," Peggy wrote, referring to the agreement that assigned some of Hunter's artwork to the daughter he has never met, even though DNA testing in 2019 established his paternity.
In his 2021 memoir, Hunter wrote dismissively about Navy's mother, Lunden Roberts, whom he met when he was spiraling into addiction and going to Washington strip clubs. He wrote that the women he had sexual encounters with during his drug "rampages" were "hardly the dating type."
"I had no recollection of our encounter," he said of Roberts. Yet he put her on the payroll of his consulting firm as a personal assistant while she was pregnant. About three months after Navy was born, Hunter took away Roberts's company health insurance.
"As she grows up, knowing that her father and paternal grandparents wanted nothing to do with her," Peggy wrote, "she will probably be able to see a video or two showing her half sister Naomi getting married on the South Lawn and you watching the fireworks on the balcony with little Beau. And if she misses that, there will be plenty of schoolmates to remind her that she wasn't wanted. Kids can be mean that way."
She asked why Hunter couldn't act like Tom Brady, who treats his son by Bridget Moynahan, the actress he was dating before he married Gisele Bündchen, the same as the two children he and Gisele had. (Not to mention Arnold Schwarzenegger, who says in a new Netflix documentary series that he has a great relationship with the son he had after a tryst with his family's housekeeper that broke up his marriage.)
"Mr. President, many years ago, you lost your daughter in a horrendous car accident," Peggy continued. "I know you still carry that pain with you every day because I have watched your face when you speak about her. Please do not throw away your granddaughter."
My sister and I often disagree about politics, but this is not a political issue to us. It's a human one. Joe Biden's mantra has always been that "the absolute most important thing is your family." It is the heart of his political narrative. Empathy, born of family tragedies, has been his stock in trade. Callously scarring Navy's life, just as it gets started, undercuts that. As Katie Rogers, a Times White House correspondent, wrote in a haunting front-page piece last weekend about Hunter's unwanted child, Biden is so sensitive "that only the president's most senior advisers talk to him about his son." Rogers said that "in strategy meetings in recent years, aides have been told that the Bidens have six, not seven, grandchildren." Jill Biden dedicated her 2020 children's book to the six grandchildren.
What the Navy story reveals is how dated and inauthentic the 80-year-old president's view of family is.
Once you could get away with using terms like "out of wedlock" and pretend that children born outside marriage didn't exist or were somehow shameful. But now we have become vastly more accepting of nontraditional families. We live in an Ancestry.com world, where people are searching out their birth parents and trying to find relatives they didn't know they had.
I have sympathy for Hunter going into a "dark, bleak hole," as he called it. I have sympathy for a father coping with a son who was out of control and who may still be fragile. With Hunter, his father can seem paralyzed about the right thing to do.
But the president can't defend Hunter on all his other messes and draw the line at accepting one little girl. You can't punish her for something she had no choice about. The Bidens should embrace the life Hunter brought into the world, even if he didn't consider her mother "the dating type."
The president's cold shoulder -- and heart -- is counter to every message he has sent for decades, and it's out of sync with the America he wants to continue to lead.

Full text: In 1973, Uri Geller claimed to bend metal with his mind on live television. Skeptics couldn't beat him. Now they've joined him.
In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC's most popular television shows, "The Dimbleby Talk-In," and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Mr. Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
"It's cracking," Mr. Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. "It's becoming like plastic."
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Mr. Geller became not just a global celebrity -- a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice -- but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn't explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
"I've never even seen a magic show," Mr. Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. "Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight."
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show "The Next Uri Geller," which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It's a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Mr. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the '70s and '80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Mr. Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled "Bend It Like Geller," which was written by the Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the "Talk-In" appearance, the book celebrates Mr. Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Mr. Harris, who was once among Mr. Geller's most avid debunkers.
Today, Mr. Harris and Mr. Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Mr. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, "Gellerism Revealed," as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Mr. Geller is an entertainer, one who'd figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Mr. Geller's bent spoons are, in a sense, the analog precursors of digital deep fakes -- images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Mr. Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Mr. Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in "The Matrix."
"It's not the spoon that bends," a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves's character. "It is only yourself."
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Mr. Geller can't actually bend metal with his brain -- and civility and fairness demands this "if" -- he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Mr. Geller's claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
"I mean this in the most respectful way," said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Mr. Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. "I think the world is aware that if he's fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging."
The best publicist in the world
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Mr. Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
"Where are you all from?" he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
"Thank you for coming to Israel!" he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Mr. Geller is a vegan who doesn't drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he'll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a "mystifier." Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
"I tell them, 'Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,"' he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. "This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience."
Mr. Geller never retired, though he doesn't travel much any more and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours -- no walk-ins, please -- to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $ 6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $ 10 million.
In Britain, Mr. Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!" as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news -- offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
"I'm the best publicist in the world, come on," he said, matter-of-factly. "You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn't matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant."
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Mr. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That's a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
"Yoko Ono, amazing woman," he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. "She always wears Porsche glasses."
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn't told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending ("Doesn't matter how I do it, whether it's real or not") and then a slightly off-key version of "My Way," in a recording sung by Mr. Geller himself, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people -- including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
"I have so many questions," said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Mr. Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting 'Bend!' in unison
By the time Mr. Geller appeared on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother's kitchen around age 5. It didn't occur to him that this could be a profession until many years later, after he had left the army and was working as a courier and part-time model. At a photo shoot, he bent a photographer's key.
"The guy freaked out and said, 'I'm having a house party tonight, will you come and demonstrate your powers because nobody is going to believe me,"' Mr. Geller recalled. "I go and I'm stunned. I'm stunned by the reaction."
He soon was paid to perform at other parties, then small theaters, then larger ones. Each performance was unscripted and chaotic, its lack of polish only enhancing the sense that this was not a show.
Word spread about this hunky guy with the paranormal act. His first setback came in 1970, when a public relations man concocted and published a fabricated image of Mr. Geller with Sophia Loren, whom he'd visited in Rome. Ms. Loren's objections made front-page news in Israel, and Mr. Geller assumed he was finished. He asked his manager to cancel that evening's show in Haifa.
"I get to the theater that night, there are 400 people outside without tickets," he said. "It was sold out. That's when I realized controversy, for me, is a diamond on a silver platter."
There were soon more platters. In 1973, he was a guest on "The Tonight Show," and for 20 intensely awkward minutes Mr. Geller didn't even try to bend the objects laid out in front of him. (The vibe was wrong, he explained.) Astonishingly, viewers seemed to regard the failure as a sign of authenticity. Only someone at the mercy of the universe's unpredictable vibrations, went the theory, could have flopped like that.
His appearance on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," a few months later, was the performance of a daredevil who doesn't need a motorcycle to risk his life.
The two academics who sat on either side of Mr. Geller were, it turned out, both fans of the paranormal. (One, Lyall Watson, argued in a book that the emotions of plants could be registered on a lie detector.) The role of rational observer fell that evening to David Berglas, one of Britain's most famous magicians, who had been invited backstage by the show's host, David Dimbleby, to offer an instant assessment.
Now 96 years old, Mr. Berglas remembered the conversation in a recent phone interview.
"Can you do that?" Mr. Dimbleby asked him when the show was over.
"Of course," Mr. Berglas said. He then picked up a teaspoon and bent it after a brief rub.
"Yes," Mr. Dimbleby said, unimpressed, "but you're a magician."
'I basically call him a fraud'
One early Geller devotee was Mr. Harris, who watched the "Dimbleby" show from his grandparents' home in Sydney, Australia. He was 15 at the time and already a performing magician. After the broadcast, as instructed by Mr. Geller, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a utensil and willed it to bend. It did.
"I was totally sucked in," he said in a recent phone interview. "If it had been presented as a magic trick, I would have figured it out immediately. But this was something else, something standing on the edge of the unknown."
It was also something new. Psychic metal bending wasn't among the dozen or so genres of magic, like card tricks or levitation. And this guy didn't dress the part. He wore street clothes and lacked a patter. Briefly, Mr. Harris said, he imagined a better world, one in which the energy crisis was solved, in part, by mind power. Because if one guy could bend a fork, who knows what a few million people could achieve?
By 1976, Mr. Harris was becoming a doubter. That year, he attended a Geller show in Brisbane, along with about 4,000 others, and remembers an eccentric, riveting performance with a tray of spoons and keys provided by the audience and stretches of silence punctuated by inexplicable bends. After the show, Mr. Harris managed to get backstage, the first and only time he met Mr. Geller in person. He handed him a matchbox, wrapped in tinfoil and tape, containing a piece of metal.
"It was a challenge from a hyperactive young man," Mr. Harris said during a recent video call with Mr. Geller. "He started to unravel it, then said: 'No, no, no, you take it home, unravel it. See if it's bent and let me know."'
It was not bent. By then, Mr. Harris realized that the slight anomaly in his grandparents' spoon three years earlier had been there all along. Like many collections of well-worn utensils, they varied in curvature, something nobody ever had reason to notice until then.
Mr. Harris felt hoodwinked, which is why the book "Gellerism Revealed" is infused with the rage of disillusionment.
"I basically call him a fraud and charlatan," he said.
James Randi, a Canadian magician and escape artist, known professionally as the Amazing Randi, went much further. A relative unknown at the time, Mr. Randi, who eventually won a MacArthur Fellowship as a professional skeptic, was the loudest anti-Geller voice in the world.
"He is intending to enter the 'psychic healing' field soon, and when he starts into that racket he can kill people," he wrote in an edition of his book "The Truth About Uri Geller." He also called Mr. Geller a "dangerous and insidious figure," one he intended to stop "at all costs."
Those costs, it turned out, were high. Mr. Geller filed defamation lawsuits against Mr. Randi, including one for claiming that Mr. Geller was performing tricks once taught on the back of cereal boxes. The so-called cornflakes case ended with a dismissal, but over the years Mr. Randi burned through most of his $ 272,000 MacArthur grant covering personal legal expenses. He died three years ago and apparently loathed his nemesis to the end. He once asked that someone throw his cremated ashes into Mr. Geller's eyes, an obituary in The Economist stated.
The vitriol is a little hard to fathom. It's true that Mr. Geller had a lucrative side hustle in the 1980s working for mining companies who thought his putative psychic powers could help them determine where to dig. In a 1986 Financial Times story, he said that his standard fee was 1 million pounds per assignment, $ 3 million in inflation-adjusted terms, and that 11 companies had retained him.
Mr. Geller's track record as a prospector is not known, and he says he can't remember. But he never went into faith healing, nor did he charge enough to leave many with a case of buyer's remorse. He performed live shows and wrote books like "Use Your Psychic Powers to Have It All."
So watching the Geller haters now is like watching people run into nursery schools shouting that there is no Santa Claus. Consider Mr. Randi's appearance on Barbara Walters's talk show in 1974. He arrived soon after Mr. Geller had been there and entranced the host by bending her door key, apparently with his mind. Mr. Randi had now come to prove that there was nothing psychic about this feat.
"Here is my identical key," Ms. Walters told Mr. Randi, challenging him to equal Mr. Geller, and clearly hoping he would fail. "Touch it and make it bend."
A few moments later, the key is bent. Ms. Walters deflates. Suddenly, Mr. Geller seemed like a workaday huckster and the world seemed a little duller. She looked at the key that Mr. Randi had just bent and began theatrically boohooing, as if to say, "Thanks for nothing, you buzz killer."
The new sleight of hand
The science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," and today magic and technology are merging. Start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
"Geller's bent spoon demonstrations and deep fakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we're seeing," said Alice Pailhès, an author of "The Psychology of Magic." "Both elicit strong emotional responses -- confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia."
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you're likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deep fake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it's going to take much more than Mr. Randi and Ben Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series "Death by Magic," said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago. He still prefers nondigital methods, though, which he attributes in no small part to the influence of Mr. Geller.
Mr. Money-Coutts first met Mr. Geller in 2003. A student at the British prep school Eton who was a budding magician, he invited Mr. Geller to perform for 700 gobsmacked schoolboys. ("I was told to write a letter to the catering department to apologize because they basically had no spoons for weeks after he came," Mr. Money-Coutts recalled.) Mr. Geller had relocated to Britain by then, having spent 12 tumultuous years in the United States, most of them in New York City.
While there, he had gotten rich, but he wasn't equipped for money or fame on this scale, and he was rattled by the verbal assaults. He struggled with panic attacks and became anorexic and bulimic. He also shopped compulsively, once buying 100 silk shirts during a visit to a Brioni store in Milan, few of which he ended up wearing.
"It was decadence," he said. "I had 10 Gucci suitcases, leather Gucci suitcases. Do you know how much they cost?"
Mr. Geller gradually regained his mental equilibrium, though his taste for luxury proved hard to shake. When he moved to Britain in the mid-80s -- a relative suggested it would be a better place to raise a family -- he fell in love with a house in Sonning, a village 40 miles west of London, because it reminded him of Graceland and the White House. He more than doubled the square footage of the place, adding bedrooms, a cinema room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. At some point, about six years ago, it all started to seem berserk.
"I just looked at the marble and the crystal chandeliers," he said of Sonning Court, as the house is known, "and I thought, 'I've got to get out of this."'
He wanted to radically downsize, he said, and today he lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment not far from where he grew up. He has settled where he began. On the off chance that he can't truly bend metal with his mind, he has done something less miraculous but nearly as implausible: He has earned a very comfortable living for 50 years performing what is essentially the most acclaimed party trick of all time.
Now and then, he speaks to magicians, giving tips and what are essentially motivational speeches. Be original, be persistent, stick with a persona, he tells listeners. At the Blackpool Magic Convention in February 2020, he gave all that advice to a packed room, and he performed a newish effect. He poured radish seeds into his hand and asked everyone to chant "Sprout!" over and over. As he swirled the seeds with a finger, a close-up camera showed a green shoot that seemed to materialize in the middle of his hand, as though it had been willed to blossom.
"Among magicians," asked a cheeky young man, during the question and answer part of the presentation, "was that a magic trick? Did you sneak a bit of cress in with your seeds?"
"Are you serious?" Mr. Geller all but shouted, more amused than galled. "Do you really think that I'm going to say at the age of 73 that this was a trick? Get a life!"

A Doomsaying Theory Resonates in Pop Culture: [Style Desk]

Full text: "The Fourth Turning" was a curiosity when it was published in the 1990s. Its influence has grown since then, and a sequel is on the way.
Close watchers of "The Watcher," the popular Netflix series about a couple who move to the New Jersey suburbs, only to be stalked in their dream home, may have caught the reference.
It comes when one of the main characters, played by Bobby Cannavale, stumbles upon a creepy man in his kitchen who describes himself as a building inspector. After Mr. Cannavale's character remarks that people are fleeing New York City, the man replies: "It's the fourth turning."
The puzzlement on Mr. Cannavale's face invites an explanation.
According to "fourth turning" proponents, American history goes through recurring cycles. Each one, which lasts about 80 to 100 years, consists of four generation-long seasons, or "turnings." The winter season is a time of upheaval and reconstruction -- a fourth turning.
The theory first appeared in "The Fourth Turning," a work of pop political science that has had a cult following more or less since it was published in 1997. In the last few years of political turmoil, the book and its ideas have bubbled into the mainstream.
According to "The Fourth Turning," previous crisis periods include the American Revolution, the Civil War and World War II. America entered its latest fourth turning in the mid-2000s. It will culminate in a crisis sometime in the 2020s -- i.e., now.
One of the book's authors, Neil Howe, 71, has become a frequent podcast guest. A follow-up, "The Fourth Turning Is Here," comes out this month.
The theory is popular with people at both ends of the political spectrum. It also inspired an acclaimed Off Broadway play, "Heroes of the Fourth Turning," which features a conservative Catholic writer, Teresa, who is obsessed with the book and its promise of a coming revolution.
The play's author, Will Arbery, 33, said he heard about "The Fourth Turning" while researching Stephen K. Bannon, the right-wing firebrand and former adviser to President Donald J. Trump, who is a longtime fan of the book and directed a 2010 documentary based on its ideas. A writer for the HBO show "Succession," Mr. Arbery said he had also found references to "The Fourth Turning" in modern corporate culture.
He described it as "this almost fun theory about history," but added: "And yet there's something deeply menacing about it."
Mr. Arbery, who said he does not subscribe to the theory, sees parallels between the fourth turning and other nonscientific beliefs. "I modeled the way that Teresa talks about the fourth turning on the way that young liberals talk about astrology," he said.
The book's outlook on the near future has made it appealing to macro traders and crypto enthusiasts, and it is frequently cited on the podcasts "Macro Voices," "Wealthion" and "On the Margin."
"I've read 'The Fourth Turning,' and indeed found it useful from a macroeconomic investing perspective," Lyn Alden, 35, an investment analyst, wrote in an email. "History doesn't repeat, but it kind of gives us a loose framework to work with."
For Ryen W. Thomas, 42, a filmmaker and co-host of a YouTube series, "Generational Talk," "The Fourth Turning" captured a mood of decline in recent American life. "I remember feeling safe in the '90s, and then as soon as 9/11 hit, the world went topsy-turvy," he said. "Every time my cohort got to the point where we were optimistic, another crisis happened. When I read the book, I was like, 'That makes sense."'
"The Fourth Turning" was conceived during a period of relative calm. In the late 1980s, Mr. Howe, a Washington, D.C., policy analyst, teamed with William Strauss, a founder of the political satire troupe the Capitol Steps.
Their first book, "Generations," told a story of American history through generational profiles going back to the 1600s. The book was said to have influenced Bill Clinton to choose a fellow baby boomer, Al Gore, as his running mate. Mr. Strauss died in 2007, and Mr. Howe has carried on the pair's work since then.
When it was published, "The Fourth Turning" drew a withering review in The New York Times by the writer Michael Lind, who criticized the authors for cherry-picking facts and lumped them in with "purveyors of pseudoscience." But when the 2008 financial crisis hit at almost exactly the point when the start of the fourth turning was predicted, it seemed to many that the authors might have been onto something. Recent events -- the pandemic, the storming of the Capitol -- have seemingly provided more evidence for the book's fans.
Mr. Howe, who is the managing director of the demography team at the investment research firm Hedgeye, likened the popularity of "The Fourth Turning" to the stock of a staple business like Campbell Soup Company during an economic crisis. The worse the news gets, the more its fortunes rise.
"Obviously, it's not intentional," he said, speaking from his home in Virginia.
Historically, a fourth turning crisis has always translated into a civil war, a war of great nations, or both, according to the book. Either is possible over the next decade, Mr. Howe said. But he is a doomsayer with an optimistic streak: Each fourth turning, in his telling, kicks off a renaissance in civic life.
In the new book, he describes what a coming civil war or geopolitical conflict might look like -- though he shies away from casting himself as a modern-day Nostradamus.
"This big tidal shift is arriving," Mr. Howe said. "But if you're asking me which wave is going to knock down the lighthouse, I can't do that. I can just tell you that this is the time period. It gives you a good idea of what to watch for."

Shortage of Crucial Antibiotic Used to Treat Syphilis Could Worsen U.S. Epidemic: [National Desk]

Full text: The primary drug used to treat the sexually transmitted infection could be scarce into next year, Pfizer warns.
A new shortage of a type of penicillin crucial to the fight against syphilis is alarming infectious disease experts, who warn that a protracted scarcity of the drug could worsen the U.S. epidemic of the sexually transmitted infection.
The shortage, announced by the drugmaker Pfizer in a letter last month, involves Bicillin L-A, a long-acting injectable antibiotic also known as penicillin G benzathine. The company cited significant increases in demand because of the rising rate of syphilis infections, as well as Bicillin's recent use as an alternative to amoxicillin, another antibiotic that has periodically been scarce and is prescribed for more general infections like strep throat.
Steven Danehy, a spokesman for Pfizer, said it would likely take about a year for the company to ramp up production by 50 percent at its plant in Rochester, Mich., and ultimately manufacture enough Bicillin to meet demand and shore up reserves.
Syphilis has been on the rise in the United States since 2000, reaching 176,713 cases in 2021, which was an increase of nearly 75 percent since 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Congenital syphilis tripled during that four-year period, to 2,855 cases, including 220 stillbirths or infant deaths. Rates are highest among the infants of Native American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and Black mothers.
Bicillin is the only recommended treatment for pregnant women who are infected, and is very effective at preventing transmission to the fetus if provided early enough. Congenital syphilis has a high fatality rate, and can otherwise cause preterm birth and severe birth defects.
"It worries me that these moms may not have access to lifesaving medication," Dr. Anita Henderson, a pediatrician in Hattiesburg, Miss., said. The state had seen large increases in the rate of congenital syphilis over the last five years, she said.
Among adult syphilis cases, nearly one-fourth are in women; just under a third are in men who have sex only with men; and about one-fifth are in men who only have sex with women.
The infection can cause sores and a rash and, if left untreated, can seriously damage the internal organs, nervous system, eyes and ears, and can be fatal.
Pfizer also warned that its supply of a rarely used pediatric version of Bicillin would soon run out because the company had begun using that drug's production line to increase the adult formula. Doctors turned to it in the last year in lieu of amoxicillin during an increase in the number of strep throat cases.
Bicillin is also used to manage rheumatic heart disease and rheumatic fever, which are particular health risks, albeit uncommon, for children. Multiple antibiotic alternatives are available for these conditions, according to Dr. Meg Doherty, director of global H.I.V., hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections programs at the World Health Organization.
To ward off bacterial infections, military recruits receive Bicillin during boot camp, where the drug is known as the "peanut butter shot" because of its color and consistency. According to Dr. Ryan C. Maves, a professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, recruits otherwise face a high risk of invasive streptococcal infection.
Alternatives to Bicillin for pregnant women are under development and review but are years away from becoming available to them, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious disease expert at the University of Southern California. He urged the Biden administration to pay Pfizer for some 500,000 doses to encourage production.
The Bicillin shortfall is but one element of a widespread drug-shortage crisis that has left doctors and pharmacists scrambling for vital therapeutic staples and forced them to ration treatments like chemotherapy. A recent Senate report also characterized the supply problems as a threat to national security.
Most drug companies have not been particularly keen on developing antibiotics, in part because the profit margin for this class of drugs is typically far lower than the next blockbuster drug that could be worth billions of dollars.
A bipartisan group in Congress recently reintroduced the $ 6 billion Pasteur Act, a Netflix-like subscription model that would act as a financial incentive for research and development by pharmaceutical companies.While the legislation could address drug shortages, its main goal is to combat the global threat of drug-resistant pathogens.
David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of S.T.D. Directors, a trade association for public health associations, said rates of syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea are all surging "in part due to a public health landscape that is stretched dangerously thin, resulting in a lack of S.T.I. prevention, testing, and treatment."
He and others criticized Pfizer for inadequate production of the drug given the decades-long rising trajectory of syphilis infections. But Pfizer's spokesman, Mr. Danehy, said the company had invested $ 38 million in its Michigan plant to improve manufacturing after a previous shortage of Bicillin in 2017.
Mr. Harvey also denounced the Biden administration for agreeing in the debt ceiling deal to slash $ 400 million from the C.D.C.'s budget for S.T.I. prevention.
To stretch the Bicillin supply, the C.D.C. recommends that doctors give preference to pregnant patients and infected or exposed infants. Other patients should instead be prescribed doxycycline for two to four weeks, depending on the disease stage. But experts expressed worry that such individuals, including the partners of pregnant women, might have trouble sticking to the twice-daily pill regimen, potentially compromising its effectiveness.
Eric Tichy, division chair of supply chain management at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said Pfizer likely stands alone in producing Bicillin for the U.S. market because of the considerable complexity and expense of manufacturing the drug.
But other experts objected to Pfizer's pricing practices. "Here's a prime example of why leaving public health to the free market can be disastrous," Tim Horn, director of medication access at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, an advocacy group, said in an email.
"Since 2013, the price of Bicillin L-A has increased an astonishing 275 percent," Mr. Horn said.
Mr. Danehy said the list price for a 4-milliliter Bicillin L-A syringe is $ 470, and that the company adjusted prices to ensure proper, quality supply.
While many health care organizations and clinics are able to secure discounts, some frontline independent clinics are paying top dollar for the antibiotic.
Dr. Phyllis Ritchie, who runs a free S.T.I. clinic largely serving gay men in Palm Springs, Calif., said the cost of a 10-pack of shots of Bicillin had risen to $ 6,500 from $ 4,000 two years ago. With the clinic using about 15 to 20 of the 10-packs annually, its $ 225,000 yearly budget can no longer withstand the financial strain, she said.
When she first began practicing medicine in the mid-1990s, Dr. Ritchie recalled, a 10-pack cost under $ 300.
"It's a crisis," she said.

TEL AVIV, Israel — In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC’s most popular television shows, “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
“It’s cracking,” Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. “It’s becoming like plastic.”
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Geller became not just a global celebrity — a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice — but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn’t explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
“I’ve never even seen a magic show,” Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. “Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight.”
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show “The Next Uri Geller,” which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It’s a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the ’70s and ’80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled “Bend It Like Geller,” which was written by Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the “Talk-In” appearance, the book celebrates Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Harris, who was once among Geller’s most avid debunkers.
Today, Harris and Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, “Gellerism Revealed,” as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Geller is an entertainer, one who’d figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Geller’s bent spoons are, in a sense, the analogue precursors of digital deepfakes — images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in “The Matrix.”
“It’s not the spoon that bends,” a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves’ character. “It is only yourself.”
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Geller can’t actually bend metal with his brain — and civility and fairness demands this “if” — he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Geller’s claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
“I mean this in the most respectful way,” said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. “I think the world is aware that if he’s fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging.”
The Best Publicist in the World
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
“Where are you all from?” he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
“Thank you for coming to Israel!” he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Geller is a vegan who doesn’t drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he’ll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a “mystifier.” Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
“I tell them, ‘Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,’” he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. “This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience.”
Geller never retired, although he doesn’t travel much anymore and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours — no walk-ins, please — to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $10 million.
In Britain, Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show “I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!” as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news — offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
“I’m the best publicist in the world, come on,” he said, matter-of-factly. “You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn’t matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant.”
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That’s a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
“Yoko Ono, amazing woman,” he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. “She always wears Porsche glasses.”
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn’t told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending (“Doesn’t matter how I do it, whether it’s real or not”) and then a slightly off-key version of “My Way,” in a recording sung by Geller, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people — including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
“I have so many questions,” said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting ‘Bend!’ in Unison
By the time Geller appeared on “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother’s kitchen around age 5. It didn’t occur to him that this could be a profession until many years later, after he had left the army and was working as a courier and part-time model. At a photo shoot, he bent a photographer’s key.
“The guy freaked out and said, ‘I’m having a house party tonight. Will you come and demonstrate your powers because nobody is going to believe me,’” Geller recalled. “I go and I’m stunned. I’m stunned by the reaction.”
He soon was paid to perform at other parties, then small theaters, then larger ones. Each performance was unscripted and chaotic, its lack of polish only enhancing the sense that this was not a show.
Word spread about this hunky guy with the paranormal act. His first setback came in 1970, when a public relations man concocted and published a fabricated image of Geller with Sophia Loren, whom he’d visited in Rome. Loren’s objections made front-page news in Israel, and Geller assumed he was finished. He asked his manager to cancel that evening’s show in Haifa.
“I get to the theater that night; there are 400 people outside without tickets,” he said. “It was sold out. That’s when I realized controversy, for me, is a diamond on a silver platter.”
There were soon more platters. In 1973, he was a guest on “The Tonight Show,” and for 20 intensely awkward minutes, Geller didn’t even try to bend the objects laid out in front of him. (The vibe was wrong, he explained.) Astonishingly, viewers seemed to regard the failure as a sign of authenticity. Only someone at the mercy of the universe’s unpredictable vibrations, went the theory, could have flopped like that.
His appearance on “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” a few months later, was the performance of a daredevil who doesn’t need a motorcycle to risk his life.
The two academics who sat on either side of Geller were, it turned out, both fans of the paranormal. (One, Lyall Watson, argued in a book that the emotions of plants could be registered on a lie detector.) The role of rational observer fell that evening to David Berglas, one of Britain’s most famous magicians, who had been invited backstage by the show’s host, David Dimbleby, to offer an instant assessment.
Now 96 years old, Berglas remembered the conversation in a recent phone interview.
“Can you do that?” Dimbleby asked him when the show was over.
“Of course,” Berglas said. He then picked up a teaspoon and bent it after a brief rub.
“Yes,” Dimbleby said, unimpressed, “but you’re a magician.”
‘I Basically Call Him a Fraud’
One early Geller devotee was Harris, who watched the “Dimbleby” show from his grandparents’ home in Sydney. He was 15 at the time and already a performing magician. After the broadcast, as instructed by Geller, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a utensil and willed it to bend. It did.
“I was totally sucked in,” he said in a recent phone interview. “If it had been presented as a magic trick, I would have figured it out immediately. But this was something else, something standing on the edge of the unknown.”
It was also something new. Psychic metal bending wasn’t among the dozen or so genres of magic, like card tricks or levitation. And this guy didn’t dress the part. He wore street clothes and lacked a patter. Briefly, Harris said, he imagined a better world, one in which the energy crisis was solved, in part, by mind power. Because if one guy could bend a fork, who knows what a few million people could achieve?
By 1976, Harris was becoming a doubter. That year, he attended a Geller show in Brisbane, Australia, along with about 4,000 others, and remembers an eccentric, riveting performance with a tray of spoons and keys provided by the audience and stretches of silence punctuated by inexplicable bends. After the show, Harris managed to get backstage, the first and only time he met Geller in person. He handed him a matchbox, wrapped in tinfoil and tape, containing a piece of metal.
“It was a challenge from a hyperactive young man,” Harris said during a recent video call with Geller. “He started to unravel it, then said: ‘No, no, no, you take it home, unravel it. See if it’s bent and let me know.’”
It was not bent. By then, Harris realized that the slight anomaly in his grandparents’ spoon three years earlier had been there all along. Like many collections of well-worn utensils, they varied in curvature, something nobody ever had reason to notice until then.
Harris felt hoodwinked, which is why the book “Gellerism Revealed” is infused with the rage of disillusionment.
“I basically call him a fraud and charlatan,” he said.
James Randi, a Canadian magician and escape artist, known professionally as the Amazing Randi, went much further. A relative unknown at the time, Randi, who eventually won a MacArthur Fellowship as a professional skeptic, was the loudest anti-Geller voice in the world.
“He is intending to enter the ‘psychic healing’ field soon, and when he starts into that racket he can kill people,” he wrote in an edition of his book “The Truth About Uri Geller.” He also called Geller a “dangerous and insidious figure,” one he intended to stop “at all costs.”
Those costs, it turned out, were high. Geller filed defamation lawsuits against Randi, including one for claiming that Geller was performing tricks once taught on the back of cereal boxes. The so-called cornflakes case ended with a dismissal, but over the years Randi burned through most of his $272,000 MacArthur grant covering personal legal expenses. He died three years ago and apparently loathed his nemesis to the end. He once asked that someone throw his cremated ashes into Geller’s eyes, an obituary in The Economist stated.
The vitriol is a little hard to fathom. It’s true that Geller had a lucrative side hustle in the 1980s working for mining companies that thought his putative psychic powers could help them determine where to dig. In a 1986 Financial Times story, he said that his standard fee was 1 million pounds per assignment, $3 million in inflation-adjusted terms, and that 11 companies had retained him.
Geller’s track record as a prospector is not known, and he says he can’t remember. But he never went into faith healing, nor did he charge enough to leave many with a case of buyer’s remorse. He performed live shows and wrote books like “Use Your Psychic Powers to Have It All.”
So watching the Geller haters now is like watching people run into nursery schools shouting that there is no Santa Claus. Consider Randi’s appearance on Barbara Walters’ talk show in 1974. He arrived soon after Geller had been there and entranced the host by bending her door key, apparently with his mind. Randi had now come to prove that there was nothing psychic about this feat.
“Here is my identical key,” Walters told Randi, challenging him to equal Geller, and clearly hoping he would fail. “Touch it and make it bend.”
A few moments later, the key is bent. Walters deflates. Suddenly, Geller seemed like a workaday huckster and the world seemed a little duller. She looked at the key that Randi had just bent and began theatrically boohooing, as if to say, “Thanks for nothing, you buzz killer.”
The New Sleight of Hand
Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and today magic and technology are merging. Startups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
“Geller’s bent spoon demonstrations and deepfakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we’re seeing,” said Alice Pailhès, an author of “The Psychology of Magic.” “Both elicit strong emotional responses — confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia.”
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you’re likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deepfake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it’s going to take much more than Randi and Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series “Death by Magic,” said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago. He still prefers nondigital methods, though, which he attributes in no small part to the influence of Geller.
Money-Coutts first met Geller in 2003. A student at British prep school Eton who was a budding magician, he invited Geller to perform for 700 gobsmacked schoolboys. (“I was told to write a letter to the catering department to apologize because they basically had no spoons for weeks after he came,” Money-Coutts recalled.) Geller had relocated to Britain by then, having spent 12 tumultuous years in the United States, most of them in New York City.
While there, he had gotten rich, but he wasn’t equipped for money or fame on this scale, and he was rattled by the verbal assaults. He struggled with panic attacks and became anorexic and bulimic. He also shopped compulsively, once buying 100 silk shirts during a visit to a Brioni store in Milan, few of which he ended up wearing.
“It was decadence,” he said. “I had 10 Gucci suitcases, leather Gucci suitcases. Do you know how much they cost?”
Geller gradually regained his mental equilibrium, although his taste for luxury proved hard to shake. When he moved to Britain in the mid-’80s — a relative suggested it would be a better place to raise a family — he fell in love with a house in Sonning, a village 40 miles west of London, because it reminded him of Graceland and the White House. He more than doubled the square footage of the place, adding bedrooms, a cinema room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. At some point, about six years ago, it all started to seem berserk.
“I just looked at the marble and the crystal chandeliers,” he said of Sonning Court, as the house is known, “and I thought, ‘I’ve got to get out of this.’”
He wanted to radically downsize, he said, and today he lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment not far from where he grew up. He has settled where he began. On the off chance that he can’t truly bend metal with his mind, he has done something less miraculous but nearly as implausible: He has earned a very comfortable living for 50 years performing what is essentially the most acclaimed party trick of all time.
Now and then, he speaks to magicians, giving tips and what are essentially motivational speeches. Be original, be persistent, stick with a persona, he tells listeners. At the Blackpool Magic Convention in February 2020, he gave all that advice to a packed room, and he performed a newish effect. He poured radish seeds into his hand and asked everyone to chant “Sprout!” over and over. As he swirled the seeds with a finger, a close-up camera showed a green shoot that seemed to materialize in the middle of his hand, as if it had been willed to blossom.
“Among magicians,” asked a cheeky young man, during the question-and-answer part of the presentation, “was that a magic trick? Did you sneak a bit of cress in with your seeds?”
“Are you serious ?” Geller all but shouted, more amused than galled. “Do you really think that I’m going to say at the age of 73 that this was a trick? Get a life!”

Full text: Renaissance, a French nonprofit, focuses on producing upcycled pieces made in the couture style while providing job training opportunities.
On a cold evening in March, a cement-floored warehouse in the gritty Paris suburb of Fontenay-sous-Bois played host to a different kind of couture fashion show. A model in a short-sleeved jacket with a bronze chevron bodice, navy silk chiffon kilt and swinging bronze chain fringe marched out to a D.J.'s club beat.
Another model wore a tangerine corset dress made of swirling strips of fabric that cascaded like a waterfall toward the floor. A third was dressed in a white silk strapless gown, gathered on the hip, that was embroidered with blue and pink posies.
Unlike traditional couture, as presented on runways in Paris this week, these clothes weren't sewn by seasoned artisans or made from precious new materials. The bronze jacket was fashioned from a secondhand pair of Etro men's pants and embroidered with thin chains from a company that had gone bankrupt.
The chiffon was dead stock from a retired couturière's atelier. The tangerine dress was made from neckties of decommissioned uniforms of the Aéroports de Paris. The white floral gown had been a 19th-century shawl.
And all were sewn by a team of studio hands who, not long ago, would have had a difficult time finding jobs in the luxury fashion industry.
The event showcased the work of Renaissance, a French nonprofit that produces upcycled pieces made in the couture style and offers job training opportunities to low-income individuals and immigrants. It was founded in 2018 by Philippe Guilet, a former design assistant to Karl Lagerfeld, Thierry Mugler and Jean Paul Gaultier, who wanted to prove that couture could be more responsible.
The organization teaches some of the most sophisticated techniques in fashion design and builds on a movement by nonprofits to train workers and help place them in fashion jobs. Like much of traditional couture, many of Renaissance's pieces are one-offs that are carefully handcrafted.
"There are other designers who work in upcycling, which is a solution for fashion waste," said Pascal Morand, the executive president of Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, the governing body for the French fashion industry, and a member of the Renaissance board. There are organizations, he noted, that teach the craft of sewing. "But Renaissance combines these two aspects on a very high level," he said.
Mr. Guilet, who had also worked for Chloé, J. Mendel and Donna Karan, had long been interested in upcycling. (For Mr. Gaultier's spring 2002 couture collection, he made a cocktail dress out of men's neckties.) He turned a pair of men's pants into a waistcoat and showed it to Mr. Morand, a longtime friend. Mr. Morand thought the piece was beautiful and asked Mr. Guilet how he could spin it into something more.
Mr. Guilet decided he wanted "to do something that was eco-responsible that also passes on this beautiful savoir-faire," he said, meaning an accomplished knowledge of craft.
He raised funding from the Kering luxury group and received grants from the French government. In September 2019, he opened an atelier in the Cité du Vercors, a public housing complex in Villejuif, a low-income suburb south of Paris. The space had been offered by Action Logement, an urban development association that helps fund and run social housing. There, Mr. Guilet set up sewing machines, work tables and Stockman dummies, and interviewed candidates sent by a government job placement agency.
He selected 15 people, including immigrants from Ghana, Morocco and Tunisia, and refugees from Ukraine and Afghanistan. Like all Renaissance students and teachers, they received wages and French employment benefits. For seven months, Mr. Guilet taught the class couture techniques, like the "Méthode Grès," a fluid style of draping invented by the couturière Madame Grès.
"Couture is about the intelligence of the hand," Mr. Guilet said. "If you understand couture, you can do anything. You are a master."
Through word of mouth, Renaissance received donations of well-made vintage clothes, which the studio turned into modern silhouettes rooted in the French classics. Mr. Guilet staged the first Renaissance fashion show in March 2020, at the Institut du Monde Arabe.
The second collection, produced by the second class of 20 students, was presented at the Drouot auction house in Paris in July 2021. Afterward, some of the outfits from the first two shows were auctioned; several gowns sold for more than $ 7,000 apiece. Some of those pieces were displayed during couture week last January.
Though there are sewing machines in the Renaissance studio, much of the work is done by hand, as it is in couture. "This is not about cutting up old dresses and sewing them into something new, but about learning the couture technique," Mr. Guilet said. "Students unpick the seams, and once it's undone, they understand what they have, and figure out how best to use it with the aim of zero waste."
During the course, each student produces two or three looks that are available for rent or purchase. Three looks ended up on the Netflix series "Emily in Paris," including a sharply tailored suit made from a judo kimono given by the former champion of France; a dress refashioned from a Sonia Rykiel dress; and another dress cut from Yamamoto men's pants and a Rykiel dress.
The organization's job training program is also flourishing. Nearly half of Renaissance's 35 graduates have landed jobs at luxury fashion houses, including Saint Laurent, Chloé, Alaïa and Dior, and several have opened their own studios, to produce wedding dresses, or do alterations and repairs.
Robby and Ted Kipre, 25-year-old twin brothers who grew up in the Cité du Vercors and were in the first class of apprentices, started a streetwear brand called Kipre Couture. They staged a show during Paris men's fashion week in January, and they have held four pop-up shops in Paris.
During the post-show reception in the Fontenay warehouse in March, Ted Kipre said that fashion had "always been our passion -- we always wanted to do it, but we didn't know where to start."
He was dressed in one of the brand's looks: black crepe pants, a leather jacket and a Kipre Couture baseball cap -- 100 percent upcycled, he said.
Renaissance is now developing a capsule collection produced by the current class of 40, selected from more than 1,300 applicants. The collection is made from uniforms donated by the RATP, the transportation agency in Paris that operates the Métro and buses. The clothes will be sold on Renaissance's e-commerce website, which is scheduled to go live in September.
"Eventually, we'd like to have a boutique," Mr. Guilet said. "Then anyone can bring in their beautiful old clothes and refashion them into something new."

Full text: If you give birth to a baby in the United States in 2023, odds are you will learn something about postpartum depression along the way -- maybe from your doctor or midwife, maybe from a celebrity or on social media.
But for many women, postpartum depression is shockingly isolating -- a mix of sadness, hopelessness and overwhelm that stems not just from the hormonal tumult of pregnancy and the postpartum period, but from many other stressors, like a lack of paid leave, insufficient child care, and the staggering responsibility of caring for a new and helpless human.
The condition, which can arise at any point during the first year postpartum -- and is distinct from the relatively short-lived "baby blues" most women experience soon after delivery -- is now recognized as one of the most common complications of childbirth. It affects one in eight new moms, and mental health struggles are a leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the United States, primarily from suicide and drug overdose.
There are more treatment options for postpartum depression now than ever before, including the first medication designed specifically to treat it. But factors like stigma and inadequate screening keep many mothers from getting help. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20 percent of women were not asked about depression during a prenatal visit, and more than half of women with postpartum depression continue to go untreated.
This spring, The New York Times spent time with four mothers who were then in the grips of postpartum depression. They offered a stark, intimate glimpse into their experiences, in their own words.
Conversations have been edited and condensed for clarity.

Allie's Story
My son was due at the end of September, but in late August, I started having contractions. I think I just went into denial, like, no, he couldn't possibly be showing up this early. The birth itself was not a great experience. They set him on my chest and I only had time to touch his back and for me to realize: "Oh. That's my baby right there." Then he was gone. I was so out of it that I kept asking: "Where is he? What's going on?" My whole body was filled with panic. But they did give him back to me, and we were able to do skin-to-skin.
On our second day in the hospital, I got hit with the baby blues. If I looked at the baby for too long, I'd start crying. If I had to hand the baby to my husband so I could go to the bathroom, I'd start crying. Once we got home, I put the baby's bassinet as close to our bed as I could, and even then, I would stay awake and just stare at him. Nighttime was the worst. As soon as the sun set, I would feel this intense doom: How much sleep will we get tonight? What if we do get sleep and something happens? We had the Owlet monitor sock and the Nanit video monitor, and even then, I would lay there listening to him breathe. I couldn't look away.
I started working with a therapist before becoming pregnant, and I knew I was at a higher risk for postpartum mental health disorders because I had a history of anxiety and depression. At three weeks postpartum, I had my medication adjusted. It helped a little, but there was always something for me to feel scared about. Is he getting enough milk? What if something happens while we're out and about?
At his one-month appointment with the pediatrician, I filled out one of those questionnaires that checks for postpartum mental health issues, and I knew that my answers were going to be a big red flag. Like, oh, we definitely need to talk to this lady. But they never said anything.
Two months ago, I found a new therapist who works specifically with postpartum moms. I see her twice a month and her office is baby-friendly, so I can bring him. It has not been a cure-all or anything close to it, but she has given me some tools to help me manage my anxiety. One is a list of questions I can ask myself to try and identify: Is this thought coming from a place of logic? A place of emotion? How likely is it for this thing to actually happen?
It has helped me a lot to know, OK, other moms also experience intrusive thoughts -- they're worried when they go to the top of the stairs that they're going to fall and drop their baby, or that something is going to happen while they're driving. But she has helped me understand that just because certain feelings are common, they are not "normal."
Carrie's Story
We struggled for about five years to get pregnant with Lily. I had multiple miscarriages and more chemical pregnancies than I can count. I do think secondary infertility caused a kind of trauma. I went into this pregnancy feeling like: I am so grateful for this. I have to soak up every second of it. And for the first month after she was born, I was euphoric. But then, and I hate saying it, it felt like the magic of it just kind of died off. It all started to feel really, really heavy.
I started to see a therapist who specializes in loss and infertility about four or five months into my pregnancy. It was online, through BetterHelp. Our insurance didn't cover it, but I had a coupon code to get a percentage off for seven sessions. In hindsight, I should have pushed to keep going, but I remember asking my husband: "Can we afford $ 350 a month?" It was like having another car payment.
I run a business making baby bonnets, and I never really stopped working. I took three weeks off after the baby was born -- if I don't show up, my husband and I don't pay our mortgage. I had this vision that I would take the baby to work with me, but I didn't think about the fact that once I'm done for the day, I go home and have two very energetic kids who need me, too.
I feel exhausted, like I am unworthy of this life that I used to love. At work, I feel like I am doing the bare minimum. It's as if my passion for doing what I love is entirely lost. At home, I feel like a zombie. My 7-year-old loves to do craft projects with me, which when I was pregnant I really enjoyed. But they feel more like a chore when dealing with the postpartum depression. The fact that I feel like I can't fully show up for my family, or for the job I love, kind of adds another level of depression, on top of the hormonal stuff.
A few weeks ago, I was really swimming in my head: Like, I have this baby here who is making it so I can't work, but if I could work, I could make more money. It was this snowballing frustration and rage. I called my husband and told him: "I need you to come home from work right now." He dropped everything and did. I was screaming and crying, and he took the baby away to give me a break. I slept for, like, five hours. After that, I spoke to my mom and she told me she thought I needed to talk to somebody.
I met with my OB-GYN and he prescribed Zoloft, and connected me to a social worker who said she's going to get me placed with a therapist, but it is going to take four to six weeks. I was shocked but I also kind of felt like: Well, maybe I am not really deserving of this help. If it's going to take six weeks, then clearly there are people out there who need it more than I do.
To me, the depression feels like a physical weight -- like, if I could just take it off of me. If I could just reach into my chest and pull it out.
Janelle's Story
I had some depression when I became a parent the first time around. I got treatment, but I feel like it kind of lingered -- and with the second pregnancy it came back full force. I don't think I knew I was feeling it again until around six weeks postpartum. My partner actually noticed before I did -- he was like, "Janelle, I think it's happening again."
That's also when I started to realize, Oh my god, I'm going to have to go back to work soon. I'm a nurse, and I had always tied that to my identity, but I started feeling like, I don't want to be a nurse anymore. Forget this license.
I couldn't concentrate on things. I was overstimulated and I was so irritable -- with my partner and with my family. I felt like: This is a lot. Did I really want this? It just felt overwhelming. I would sit on the couch and just watch Netflix. I'd try and get up and do something, but it felt like I was stuck.
I started seeing a therapist who works with my OB-GYN's clinic. It was not a good fit, but she told me about a place called The Motherhood Center that offers a more intensive level of care. You go for full days, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. I knew I needed help, but I also felt like, Am I really that bad, that I need that type of assistance? It was hard to come to terms with: I need mental health help. I was in the program from December to February.
A few months after the baby was born, I did have feelings of not wanting to be here anymore. It was this feeling of impending doom, like something bad was going to happen. I never spoke about that when it was happening, because you feel so ashamed. How do you say that out loud? One fear you have is, Are they going to take my children away? There's such a stigma to all of this -- even doing this interview.
I'm taking Prozac and I am continuing to go to therapy -- and I am doing better, though I still have hard weeks. I want people to know that motherhood is so complex, and it's beautiful. I think that getting treatment and being vulnerable is so important. Because it's in the vulnerability that you're able to move forward.
Shivani's Story
I struggled a lot with fertility: We tried for a year, and then I suffered a miscarriage. After that, I had an ectopic pregnancy that essentially took three months to diagnose, and then it took us a whole year after that to get pregnant again. Then a month before our son was born, my husband developed fungal pneumonia. I had to resuscitate him, and he had to be hospitalized and intubated. I think all of that contributed to what I experienced postpartum.
I was in a lot of pain after the birth, to the point where I couldn't really sit up in bed, and I was just really, really exhausted. I was also having a hard time breastfeeding -- he wasn't really latching. When it was time for our son's first pediatrician's appointment, I had my husband and my mom take him because I couldn't move, I couldn't sit, everything was uncomfortable. I cried the entire time they were gone. I felt like such a failure of a mother.
Every time I had Rishav at the breast, I started to cry. I dreaded feeding him every two hours. I knew he was relying on me for food, but it was hurting me and he wasn't getting enough, and it just felt like too much. I switched to exclusive pumping, but I had a lot of guilt, pain and shame around breastfeeding. I didn't feel that immediate, instant connection to him. I did have moments -- not long periods, and not anything I ever felt like I would act on -- when I wondered whether my son was better off without me. Was I just not a good mom? Was I not made to be a good mom?
When I was around four or five weeks postpartum, I met with my therapist (I had been in therapy before, and scheduled the appointment when I was still pregnant) and told her: "I am crying all the time. I do not think this is the baby blues."
At my six-week postpartum checkup, something still felt wrong physically. I still felt a lot of pressure, and I didn't know if it was my stitches or something else. My OB-GYN referred me to a pelvic floor physical therapist and urogynecologist. Then she started getting ready to leave the room, and I was like: "Wait! Before you go, there's something I really want to speak to you about, which is my mental health." And that's when I just started crying. She thanked me for bringing it up, and told me that because of how busy things are she's not always able to.
I had a urinary tract infection, and the urogynecologist diagnosed me with prolapse, both of the uterus and the rectum. Thankfully, my husband has great health insurance so I was able to see a pelvic floor physical therapist.
At around nine months, I started feeling a lot better emotionally. I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that I was finally doing much better physically. I'm definitely still healing, but now that my son is turning 1, I kind of look back at that whole experience in awe. I'm like, Wow. I made a lot of progress. I guess there's a message of hope in here.

You go for full days, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. I knew I needed help, but I also felt like, Am I really that bad, that I need that type of assistance? It was hard to come to terms with: I need mental health help. I was in the program from December to February.
A few months after the baby was born, I did have feelings of not wanting to be here anymore. It was this feeling of impending doom, like something bad was going to happen. I never spoke about that when it was happening, because you feel so ashamed. How do you say that out loud? One fear you have is, Are they going to take my children away? There’s such a stigma to all of this — even doing this interview.
I’m taking Prozac and I am continuing to go to therapy — and I am doing better, though I still have hard weeks. I want people to know that motherhood is so complex, and it’s beautiful. I think that getting treatment and being vulnerable is so important. Because it’s in the vulnerability that you’re able to move forward.

Shivani’s Story
I struggled a lot with fertility : We tried for a year, and then I suffered a miscarriage. After that, I had an ectopic pregnancy that essentially took three months to diagnose, and then it took us a whole year after that to get pregnant again. Then a month before our son was born, my husband developed fungal pneumonia. I had to resuscitate him, and he had to be hospitalized and intubated. I think all of that contributed to what I experienced postpartum.
I was in a lot of pain after the birth, to the point where I couldn’t really sit up in bed, and I was just really, really exhausted. I was also having a hard time breastfeeding — he wasn’t really latching. When it was time for our son’s first pediatrician’s appointment, I had my husband and my mom take him because I couldn’t move, I couldn’t sit, everything was uncomfortable. I cried the entire time they were gone. I felt like such a failure of a mother.
Every time I had Rishav at the breast, I started to cry. I dreaded feeding him every two hours. I knew he was relying on me for food, but it was hurting me and he wasn’t getting enough, and it just felt like too much. I switched to exclusive pumping, but I had a lot of guilt, pain and shame around breastfeeding. I didn’t feel that immediate, instant connection to him. I did have moments — not long periods, and not anything I ever felt like I would act on — when I wondered whether my son was better off without me. Was I just not a good mom? Was I not made to be a good mom?
When I was around four or five weeks postpartum, I met with my therapist (I had been in therapy before, and scheduled the appointment when I was still pregnant) and told her: “I am crying all the time. I do not think this is the baby blues.”
At my six-week postpartum checkup, something still felt wrong physically. I still felt a lot of pressure, and I didn’t know if it was my stitches or something else. My OB-GYN referred me to a pelvic floor physical therapist and urogynecologist. Then she started getting ready to leave the room, and I was like: “Wait! Before you go, there’s something I really want to speak to you about, which is my mental health.” And that’s when I just started crying. She thanked me for bringing it up, and told me that because of how busy things are she’s not always able to.
I had a urinary tract infection, and the urogynecologist diagnosed me with prolapse, both of the uterus and the rectum. Thankfully, my husband has great health insurance so I was able to see a pelvic floor physical therapist.
At around nine months, I started feeling a lot better emotionally. I think a lot of that had to do with the fact that I was finally doing much better physically. I’m definitely still healing, but now that my son is turning 1, I kind of look back at that whole experience in awe. I’m like, Wow. I made a lot of progress . I guess there’s a message of hope in here.

Full text: Minjee Lee has spent these past few years feeling golf's glories and agonies more than most.
She won her first major tournament at the 2021 Evian Championship, a come-from-behind playoff victory, and followed it less than a year later with a record-setting win at the 2022 U.S. Women's Open. Then came a tie for 43rd when she tried to defend her Evian title, worries about exhaustion and a pair of frustrating finishes in the first two majors of this year.
Now ranked sixth in the world after reaching No. 2 last summer, Lee, a 27-year-old Australian, will have to conquer Pebble Beach Golf Links -- the renowned course on the California coast -- if she is to defend her Open title. The tournament begins Thursday.
In a springtime interview at T.P.C. Harding Park in San Francisco, Lee discussed her masterful iron play, the hazards of Pebble Beach, the evolution of the women's game and why winning a major once, never mind twice, is so difficult.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
You haven't missed a cut at a major since 2019.
I didn't even know.
How much of that represents a progression of your athletic talent versus your mind-set?
You're always trying to get a little bit better each day. So for me, for my progression and not having missed a cut over that period of time, I feel like I've put in a lot of hours and effort into my game and improving each day. It just shows my consistency over X amount of time.
How did winning the Evian Championship in 2021 shape the subsequent years?
It was a bit of a relief because there was a lot of talk: "When is she going to win her first major?" I heard a lot of things, but they were never to my face. They were always in passing or social media or a lot of things here and there. So it was kind of a relief, a monkey off my back. I knew I had it in me, but it finally happened -- like, to actually get a win in a major is really, really hard.
You always work toward winning majors, and your goals are very specific, so for that to be my first one, it led into my next year, as well.
And as you learned last year at Evian, defending a championship is hard to do.
Oh, yeah. It's really hard.
Going into Pebble Beach, how do you approach trying to defend a major?
The hardest thing is to do your normal thing. Usually when you're defending, you're pulled in a lot of different directions: media, your practice rounds, you put in a lot of work because it's a new venue and you have to do all of your prep starting from scratch.
It's not like Evian, where I already knew the golf course and had played it for years. [This year], it will be a little bit different. The U.S. Open has always meant a lot to me and to be able to win it was a dream come true for me. I don't know how it will feel driving in there as a defending champion.
The wind will be a factor at Pebble Beach. You grew up in Australia and dealt with the wind. You live in Texas and deal with the wind. Does it feel like an advantage this year?
I like playing in the wind -- I like a tough test of golf. I just feel like you can really use your creativity when it's windy. Low shots are key, but it's not always just the low shots. Are you going to use the wind? Are you going to fight the wind? It's just a lot of different ways that you can play in the wind. I find it more fun when it's harder, and because it really separates who is a good ball-striker and who isn't as good, it really separates the field. I've always played in wind, so it doesn't really feel that different for me.
There are not many better iron players on the planet. Do you find yourself still emphasizing irons when you practice and prepare, or can you afford to spend more time on other things?
I never really felt like I was better in that aspect until I saw the stat. Yeah, sure, my stats were better than the men, but I never really specifically worked on my irons -- like, I always worked on my technique or how I move a certain way for a certain shot. But last year, it just happened to be better than any other year, and I'm not sure what really changed. It just kind of happened. You just work on something for so long, and then at one point, it just clicks. I probably don't work on my swing as much right now; I'm working on other parts of my game, but only because those other areas are where I'd benefit the most.
You've said you don't pay attention to stats, but you set the Open scoring record last year, earning the highest payout in history ( $ 1.8 million) for women's golf. Do you think about those kinds of superlatives?
I feel like I don't -- not as much as I should. I probably should look at it and think, "Oh, you did really well," and then compliment myself. I just do my work, and when I'm away from the golf course, I don't think about golf.
There's a moment in the Netflix documentary series "Full Swing" when Brooks Koepka talks about how golf is a game where, when things are going well, you think you're never going to lose it, and when it's not going well, you think you'll never find your way back. This year hasn't been a glide path for you. Where are you on that continuum?
I had an off-season, like I always would in that period of time, and then played Asia and didn't have that good of results. I was like, I'm just going to take a few weeks more at home, and I missed three events and that happened to be six weeks.
Time went so quickly, and I was like, I've spent eight years going full-throttle, I'm allowed to take that time for myself. So I did, and I feel good. I feel quite refreshed. First week was Chevron -- a major coming back for the first week -- and I'm slowly working back into playing rhythms.
You changed caddies recently. How has it affected you on the course?
I've actually learned a lot about myself. When you're younger, you rely a lot on your caddie, and I think I did that for quite a long time, just because I was young and didn't know what I wanted as much. Now I know myself a bit better and I've matured a lot more.
It just feels like I know what I want in a caddie and all that I need from my caddie. I don't need the reassurance; I know what I'm doing. I just need somebody who knows me well, who is going to be a good companion out on the golf course. We spend so much time with them on the golf course, it's like if you don't like that person, it's just not going to work.
This is the first U.S. Women's Open at Pebble Beach, somewhere that looms large in golf's imagination. What's the bigger milestone for women's golf: that the Open is being played at Pebble Beach, or that last year's British Open was at Muirfield, where women couldn't even be members until 2017?
I'm a little bit mixed in that aspect. I'm really happy and grateful that we were able to play at Muirfield and have access to the golf course, and being at Pebble for the first time. I know that a lot of work goes into having those championships there. It's not easy -- nothing is easy, right? -- but I am a little bit bittersweet that it took this much time to get the women on these golf courses. I'm very appreciative of the tours and the U.S. Golf Association and all of our sponsors for really pushing the women's game and the L.P.G.A. to go to all of these great venues now, and I know it's only going to get better.
But I feel like it was a long time coming.
In February, you said one of your goals was not to be totally exhausted by the end of 2023. We've seen more and more elite athletes talk about burnout, mental illness, depression and exhaustion. How much of that weighs on your mind as you're trying to sort out when to play?
I've always had quite a full year. I've played a lot of events, and that's what I really wanted to do. I wanted to play. But now I want to play less -- like, I don't want to be as tired coming down to some really important events at the end of the year.
Now my priorities are different. I don't need to spend all of my time playing every single event, trying to keep my card as a rookie. I'm getting older, so I want to look after my body, look after my mind. That's what's going to help me perform my best, so I think that's why a lot of athletes are now talking about taking care of your well-being, taking care of your mind, where you are in your life. Just to be healthy inside and out I think is really important, and if nobody talks about it, nobody will really know about it either, so you can't get the proper help if you need it.
Does having won two majors help you feel liberated that you can take the breaks and take the pauses -- that there's maybe a little less to prove?
Not really. I've never really thought about it in that way. Obviously, I am hungry for more: I want to win the other majors, and I don't think that will ever change. And I've been close to world No. 1 a couple of times but not quite got over the line. So I still have a lot to show. I have a lot of fight left in me. I still have a lot of drive.
You played for the first time when you were about 10. Looking back, do you wish you had started earlier? Started later?
It was a good age for me. I swam and I played golf. I didn't know what I wanted to do, and I just tried a bunch of things: different sports, dance, music, everything. I was fortunate that my parents let me try everything. I just found it in golf, and I really enjoyed practicing and going and seeing my friends at the golf course. I used to hit these squishy golf balls around on the chipping green, and it was just fun. The way I got into it, I think it was the right way.
Was golf your best sport?
Well, I have pretty good hand-eye coordination, but I think because we were really a golfy family -- my parents and my brother and my grandparents, they all loved playing golf, so we were just always around it.
As a two-time Olympian, do you want to play in Paris next year?
That's pretty high on my list. I think Paris will be a pretty amazing turnout. The Olympics are probably the greatest honor you can have of representing your country, so I think that is going to be one of my bigger goals for next year.
But Pebble Beach comes first. When do you start playing it in your head?
I'm not really a look-up-the-golf-course-beforehand kind of girl. I've seen some holes on TV but nothing too much in detail.
I like seeing the course and really visualizing it when I get there. I wouldn't be able to tell if I did it on the map. I just like to internalize it when I get there.

Fireworks Have a Splashy New Competitor This 4th of July: Drone Shows: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The light displays are quieter, safer and better for the environment.
Like many in the fireworks industry, Stephen Vitale is in the family business. He runs a fifth-generation company, Pyrotecnico, in New Castle, Pa. In October, he struck a surprising alliance with Nova Sky Stories, the drone company that Kimbal Musk acquired from Intel.
Increasingly, drones are lighting up skybound entertainment shows. Flocks of flying robots have created magical illusions everywhere from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to the coronation of King Charles III this spring. And the global drone light show market, which was virtually nonexistent a decade ago, was valued at about $ 1 billion in 2021, according to Allied Market Research.
Drone shows are in some ways the newer, hipper brand of fireworks. And they're quieter, safer and better for the environment.
Fireworks providers like Vitale face a tough decision: Invest in the expensive equipment and regulatory clearance required to get into the drone business, or believe that demand for fireworks will remain steady even as a new type of competition skyrockets.
Change is coming. Fireworks providers bring in most of their revenue around the Fourth of July. And some of the organizers of those events are shifting to drones. Places like Salt Lake City and Boulder, Colo., plan to use them instead of fireworks for Independence Day celebrations this year, citing the reduced risk of forest fires and pollution.
But not everyone is convinced the light shows will suffice as a replacement. Galveston, Texas, is reverting to fireworks after using drones in 2022. And Reddit pages about the drawbacks of drone shows bemoan the fact that drones don't evoke the booming sounds that fireworks do.
"Drones are much more sophisticated," said Chris Hopkins, who co-owns Celebration Fireworks and Star Flight Drone Shows. "They just don't have the same visceral reaction."
Pivoting is a big investment. Hopkins invested in drones last year, eager to take advantage of the creative liberties they offered. "In the past, I could have hinted at the Demogorgon," he told DealBook, referring to a monster in the Netflix show "Stranger Things." "Now I can have the Demogorgon."
It was an expensive gambit: Drones cost more than $ 1,500 each, and he soon learned that a good show required at least 75. Then there was the hassle of filling out a nearly 200-page application to the Federal Aviation Administration for regulatory clearance and finding people skilled at flying the devices.
Some companies are sticking with fireworks. "I know there are some companies that are doing that -- I guess our philosophy is we're going to do what we do best," Heather Gobet of Western Display, a fourth-generation fireworks company in Oregon, told DealBook.
Gobet, who bought the business from her parents about eight years ago, has decided that dealing with the expertise, certifications and expense of acquiring drones is prohibitive. Instead, she will team up with companies that offer drone shows when customers demand them.
Besides, she has other challenges to worry about: The industry is grappling with supply chain snarls, labor shortages, an aging generation of pyrotechnic experts and costly compliance.
There's hope for industry harmony. Drones can be used for advertising in a way that fireworks cannot -- say, by displaying a corporate logo above a busy road. Many shows, like a Democratic celebration of the 2020 presidential election result, feature both drones and fireworks.
But growing competition is opening up opportunities, said Rick Boss, who runs Sky Elements, a nearly three-year-old drone show company. Larger traditional fireworks companies are looking to expand or go into new realms like drones, while smaller fireworks businesses are struggling.
"There are companies that are shrinking, maybe even stepping out of it -- and so that creates opportunity," he said. "It's a good time to be aggressive." -- Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Bidenomics 2.0. President Biden sought to reboot the messaging on his economic record, as his poll ratings have been stuck in doldrums despite seemingly good data: 13 million new jobs, unemployment rates for Black and Hispanic Americans at record lows and a new industrial policy to drive green investment. Inflation is a big reason, with Americans still feeling the sting of rising prices. But the Biden team believes it also needs to do a better job of salesmanship.
Ryan Reynolds and RedBird put the pedal to the metal. The Canadian actor teamed up with the private equity firm to lead a 200 million-euro ( $ 218 million) investment in Alpine, the Formula 1 team owned by Renault. The group also included the actors Michael B. Jordan and Rob McElhenney, Reynolds's partner in owning the Welsh soccer club Wrexham A.F.C., which has become a media phenomenon thanks to the Hulu series about the team.
The Supreme Court has a big week. The court made a series of major decisions: It struck down affirmative action at universities; it backed a business that refused to provide services to a same-sex couple despite a state law that forbids discrimination against gay people; and it rejected Biden's proposal to cancel at least some student debt, imposing new restrictions on presidential power.
Weekend wins. As people's schedules changed during the pandemic, consumer spending shifted away from weekdays to weekends, according to The Economist. The reasons: Fewer workers are going to the office and going out after work, and many restaurants, bars and clubs shut for good during lockdowns.
The never-ending Aperol spritz summer
For many Americans, summer holiday weekends mean cold beverages at cookouts. Beer is the stereotypical go-to choice, but sales by volume have been declining. What has become more dominant? For many, an Italian cocktail called the Aperol spritz.
Over more than a decade, the drink, with its signature bright orange hue and slightly bitter bite, has outlasted countless rival drinks of the summer and pandemic lockdowns. Its enduring success is a testament to how clever marketing and adroit navigating of trends turned an obscure Italian aperitivo into a staple for urban millennials.
A primer on Aperol. Created in 1919, the beverage had largely been confined to northern Italy until 2003, when Campari Group bought Aperol and began to roll out a meticulous marketing campaign. The company quickly homed in on the spritz -- a simple cocktail with an easy-to-remember recipe of three parts sparkling wine, two parts Aperol and one part club soda -- as the vehicle.
Those efforts have paid off handsomely for Campari. Aperol accounted for 21 percent of the company's €2.7 billion ( $ 2.9 billion) in revenue last year, and grew 28 percent globally and nearly 50 percent in the United States alone.
Experts chalk up its success to a number of factors, beyond wall-to-wall marketing:
The rise of low-alcohol cocktails. After decades of what Spiros Malandrakis of the research firm Euromonitor called "high-energy" going-out drinking (read: shots), Aperol is a relatively lightweight 11 percent alcohol by volume.
The ease of making it. "It's a very forgiving cocktail," even for home bartenders, said Julie Reiner, a co-owner of the New York cocktail bars Milady's and Leyenda.
Aperol's inherent attractiveness on social media. "The orange hue looks so good in Instagram feeds," Malandrakis said -- and its association with European glamour is reinforced by the likes of its prominence in HBO's "The White Lotus."
Aperol's success stands out in the fad-driven cocktails industry. Remember when hard seltzers like White Claw were the talk of the town? Or how Dirty Shirleys were last summer's must-have drink? Those concoctions may have faded, but Aperol's appeal has not: Campari said sales in the first quarter were up 33 percent from a year earlier.
That has led to a surge in sales of bitters more generally. The category sold 487.8 million liters' worth last year, according to Euromonitor, up 30 percent from 2012.
The Aperol spritz's popularity has helped turn an entire range of cocktails -- many of which follow the blueprint of the original drink but substitute in other ingredients -- into must-haves at bars.
"For a brunch menu, you've got to have a spritz," Reiner said. "It's a category that's just growing, because people like it." (When she reopened Milady's last fall, she created two cocktails: a martini riff and a take on an Aperol spritz that uses ruby-colored sparkling Lambrusco instead of Prosecco.)
Aperol is likely to have legs for some time. "I don't see it going anywhere for three to five years at least," Malandrakis said, while noting that tastes will eventually change.
Campari continues to have high hopes for its best seller as well: In February, Robert Kunze-Concewitz, the company's C.E.O., told analysts, "We're only at the very beginning of a very long Aperol runway."
Which BBQ ingredient is an inflation anomaly?
Ingredients for your Fourth of July cookout are more expensive this year. While inflation has come down from its 2022 heights of about 9 percent, prices remain high: On average, prices for grilling favorites are about 31 percent higher than they were four years ago, according to the "BBQ index," a report by Rabobank's market research unit, RaboResearch. But there is one exception. Which of these items costs about as much as it did in 2020?
Ground beef
Burger buns
Lettuce
Potato chips
Beer
Tomato
Find the answer below.
Thanks for reading! We are taking a break for the holiday. We'll see you on July 5.
We'd like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.
Quiz answer: It's the tomato. The U.S. market has seen a surge in tomato imports, particularly those grown in Mexico, said Almuhanad Melhim, an analyst who focuses on fresh produce at the RaboResearch. That has brought down prices.
The item with the highest price increase? Burger buns, whose prices were sent soaring by an increase in wheat prices after Russia invaded Ukraine, and remain high.

Full text: He got laughs and won awards on Broadway in "Enter Laughing" and in movies like "Little Miss Sunshine." But he also had a flair for drama.
Alan Arkin, who won a Tony Award for his first lead role on Broadway, received an Academy Award nomination for his first feature film, and went on to have a long and diverse career as a character actor who specialized in comedy but was equally adept at drama, died on Thursday in San Marcos, Calif. He was 89.
His son Matthew Arkin said that Mr. Arkin, who had heart ailments, died at home.
Mr. Arkin was not quite a show-business neophyte when he was cast in the 1963 Broadway comedy "Enter Laughing," Joseph Stein's adaptation of Carl Reiner's semi-autobiographical novel about a stage-struck boy from the Bronx. He had toured and recorded with the Tarriers, a folk music group, and he had appeared on Broadway with the Second City, the celebrated improvisational comedy troupe. But he was still a relative unknown.
He did not stay unknown for long.
In a cast that included established professionals like Sylvia Sidney and Vivian Blaine, Mr. Arkin stole the show and won the hearts of the critics. "'Enter Laughing' is marvelously funny, and so is Alan Arkin in the principal role," Howard Taubman wrote in The New York Times.
Mr. Arkin won a Tony. The show ran for a year and made him a star.
Reviewers were again enthusiastic, and Mr. Arkin again found himself in a hit show, when he returned to Broadway in 1964 as a woebegone misfit in Murray Schisgal's absurdist farce "Luv," staged by Mike Nichols and co-starring Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson. With two Broadway triumphs under his belt, it was a confident Mr. Arkin who moved from the stage to the screen in 1966.
"I never had any doubts about making it in movies," he told The Daily News a year later. "I just knew I had to, because there was no alternative."
His confidence proved justified. He was nominated for an Oscar for his first feature film, "The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming," an offbeat comedy about the hysteria that ensues when a Russian submarine runs aground on an island in Massachusetts. As the frantic leader of a landing party sent ashore to find a way to refloat the vessel, he earned a place in cinema history with a riotous scene in which he teaches his non-English-speaking crew to say "Emergency! Everybody to get from street!"
That led to a series of roles that established him as a man of a thousand accents, or close to it. He played a French detective in "Inspector Clouseau" (1968), putting his own spin on a role created (and subsequently reclaimed) by Peter Sellers; a Puerto Rican widower in "Popi" (1969); a Lithuanian sailor in the television movie "The Defection of Simas Kudirka" (1978); and many other nationalities and ethnicities.
"I could play any kind of foreigner," he told The Times in 1970. "But I can't play any kind of native of anywhere."
But he soon became even better known for playing likably hapless Everyman characters. The ultimate Arkin Everyman was Captain Yossarian in "Catch-22" (1970), Mike Nichols's film version of Joseph Heller's celebrated World War II novel.
"Catch-22" received mixed reviews and was a disappointment at the box office, but Mr. Arkin's performance as Yossarian, a panicky bombardier constantly looking for ways to avoid combat, was widely praised. In his Times review, Vincent Canby said of Mr. Arkin that "because he projects intelligence with such monomaniacal intensity, he is both funny and heroic at the same time."
By that time Mr. Arkin had also successfully ventured outside the realm of comedy, establishing a lifelong pattern. In "Wait Until Dark" (1967), a suspense drama starring Audrey Hepburn as a blind woman who is terrorized by drug dealers looking for a secret stash of heroin, he was convincingly evil as the dealer in chief.
In "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" (1968), based on the novel by Carson McCullers, he played a deaf man drawn to help the disadvantaged in a racially divided Southern town. That performance earned him his second Oscar nomination.
It would be almost 40 years before his third nomination, and his only Oscar, for his portrayal of a crusty and heroin-habituated grandfather in the indie comedy "Little Miss Sunshine" (2006). His fourth and final nomination was for his role as a cynical movie producer in "Argo" (2012), Ben Affleck's based-on-a-true-story account of the made-in-Hollywood rescue of hostages in Iran.
The years between nominations were busy ones.
Alan Wolf Arkin was born on March 26, 1934, in Brooklyn to David Arkin, a painter and writer, and Beatrice (Wortis) Arkin, a teacher whom he later remembered as "a tough old Depression-style lefty." The family later moved to Los Angeles, where his father lost his job as a schoolteacher when he refused to answer questions about his political beliefs.
Mr. Arkin studied acting at Los Angeles City College and later at Bennington College in Vermont, which was a women's school at the time but accepted a few male theater students.
His first professional experience, however, was not as an actor but as a singer and guitarist with the Tarriers, a folk group that had hits with "The Banana Boat Song" and other records.
"I thought it was going to be an entree into an acting career, like the naïve young man that I was," Mr. Arkin said in 2020 when he and his son Adam were guests on "Gilbert Gottfried's Amazing Colossal Podcast." "It didn't, so I quit them after two years."
His first notable work as an actor was with the Second City in Chicago, which he joined in 1960. "I took the Second City job because I was failing in New York," he told The Times in 1986. "I couldn't get arrested. When I got there I wasn't funny at all. But slowly I built one character, then another, and the audience helped teach me what was funny and what didn't work."
He made his Broadway debut in 1961 in the company's revue "From the Second City." From there, it was a short step to "Enter Laughing."
It was also a relatively short step from acting to directing. In 1966 he directed the Off Broadway play "Eh?," which featured a young Dustin Hoffman. In 1969 he directed a successful Off Broadway revival of Jules Feiffer's dark comedy "Little Murders."
He also directed the 1971 movie version, which starred Elliott Gould and in which Mr. Arkin played a small role. It was one of only two feature films he directed. Neither "Little Murders" nor "Fire Sale," released in 1977, was a hit.
By far the most successful of his dozen or so stage directing credits was the original Broadway production of the Neil Simon comedy "The Sunshine Boys" (1972), which starred Jack Albertson and Sam Levene as two feuding ex-vaudevillians reunited against their will, and for which he received a Tony nomination.
Mr. Arkin told The Times in 1986, when he was staging an Off Broadway revival of the 1937 farce "Room Service," that he much preferred directing for the stage to acting on it.
"I'm always grateful that I don't have to do it," he said. "I haven't been onstage for 20 years, and there have been maybe 15 minutes when I wanted to go back."
But he continued to stay busy in the movies. His memorable roles in the 1970s included a sympathetic Sigmund Freud coping with the drug-addicted Sherlock Holmes (Nicol Williamson) in "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution" (1976), and a mild-mannered dentist -- another quintessential Arkin Everyman -- dragged into an insane adventure by a mysterious character (Peter Falk) who may or may not be a C.I.A. agent in "The In-Laws" (1979).
Among his later film roles were a worn-out real estate salesman in the film version of David Mamet's play "Glengarry Glen Ross" (1992), a psychiatrist treating a professional hit man (John Cusack) in "Grosse Pointe Blank" (1997) and an overprotective father in "Slums of Beverly Hills" (1998). But from the 1980s on, much of his best work was done on television.
"There was a period of a year or two when I wasn't getting many good offers," he said in 1986. "And a television show came along that I thought was exceptional, and within two weeks there was another one." He added, "Although I'm more impressed by movies, I find I'm more moved by television."
In addition to numerous made-for-TV movies, Mr. Arkin's small-screen roles included the title character, a scheming hospital administrator, on the short-lived sitcom "Harry" (1987); a judge on the cable drama "100 Centre Street" in 2001 and 2002; Grace's father in a 2005 episode of "Will & Grace"; and, most recently, the cranky agent and best friend of an aging acting coach (Michael Douglas) on the first two seasons of the critically praised Netflix comedy "The Kominsky Method," for which he received Emmy and Golden Globe nominations in 2019 and 2020.
He was nominated for six Emmys in his career, including for his performances in two TV movies based on real events, "Escape From Sobibor" (1987) and "The Pentagon Papers" (2003), although he never won.
In 1998 he returned to the stage for the first time in more than 30 years, to good reviews, when he teamed with Elaine May for "Power Plays," an Off Broadway program of three one-acts. In addition to directing all three and writing one of them (the other two were written by Ms. May), he appeared in two: his own "Virtual Reality," the surreal story of two men awaiting the delivery of a mysterious shipment, with his son Anthony Arkin; and Ms. May's "In and Out of the Light," in which he played a lecherous dentist alongside Anthony, Ms. May and her daughter, Jeannie Berlin.
Mr. Arkin's first two marriages, to Jeremy Yaffe and the actress Barbara Dana, ended in divorce. In addition to his sons, Matthew, Adam and Anthony, he is survived by his wife, Suzanne Newlander Arkin, and four grandchildren.
Mr. Arkin was also an occasional author. He wrote several children's books, among them "The Lemming Condition" (1976) and "Cassie Loves Beethoven" (2000). In 2011 he published a memoir, "An Improvised Life"; he followed that in 2020 with "Out of My Mind," a brief history of his search for meaning in the universe and his embrace of Eastern philosophy.
Toward the end of "An Improvised Life," Mr. Arkin reflected on his chosen profession. Noting that a lot of actors "are better at pretending to be other people than they are at being themselves," he wrote, "When things get tense, when I start taking my work a bit too seriously, I remind myself that I'm only pretending to be a human being."

Marvin Kitman, 93, Who Twitted TV Networks for 35 Years, Is Dead: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He twitted the networks for 35 years as a critic at Newsday. He also audited George Washington's wartime expense account and wrote a biography of Bill O'Reilly.
Marvin Kitman, who survived longer as a television reviewer than most of the programs he mirthfully critiqued, and who as a satirist and amateur historian audaciously, if belatedly, audited George Washington's Revolutionary War expense account, died on Thursday at the Actors Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. He was 93.
His son, Jamie Kitman, said the cause was cancer.
Mr. Kitman joined the leftist but anti-Soviet magazine The New Leader as a TV critic in 1967, only after the magazine's editor agreed that he could reveal in his first column that he had never regularly watched television.
He began writing a syndicated column for the Long Island daily newspaper Newsday on Dec. 7, 1969 -- "a day that will live in infamy," he said, "as far as the TV industry is concerned."
Over 35 years he churned out 5,786 columns, championing groundbreaking shows like "All in the Family," "Seinfeld" and "Monty Python's Flying Circus" while mercilessly panning others. He branded the 1980 debut of the sixth season of "Saturday Night Live" "offensive and raunchy" and wrote of "Kentucky Woman," a 1983 TV movie starring Cheryl Ladd, the former "Charlie's Angels" star: "Cheryl Ladd as a coal miner was a very moving television experience. It made me want to convert to nuclear power."
In 1982, Mr. Kitman was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for criticism. His last column was published on April 1, 2005. ("Newsday gave me a tryout," he wrote, "and after 35 years we decided it wasn't working out.")
He also wrote a number of books. The most notable was probably "George Washington's Expense Account" (1970), for which he was listed as Washington's co-author under the name Marvin Kitman, Pfc. (Ret.)
A work of nonfiction and not satire, it included a facsimile of Washington's ledger itemizing cases of Madeira for personal use and military outlays for his army's frequent, if occasionally strategic, advances to the rear.
An article about the book in The New York Times said that Mr. Kitman's interpretation straddled "the line that divides verity from travesty" -- not unlike Washington himself, who "at times struggled mightily over whether a certain expense was public or private" and "usually resolved the issue in favor of himself."
The historian Robin W. Winks, writing in The Times Book Review, declared that the book was a vehicle for Washington's famous cherry tree to inflict its revenge. As evidence of Mr. Kitman's prodigious research into Washington's intemperance, he cited a mention that the general had gained 28 pounds during the war, which lasted more than seven years.
Washington magnanimously rejected the $ 6,000 annual salary offered by Congress (the equivalent of about $ 1.7 million in today's dollars over eight years). Instead, Mr. Kitman wrote, the commander in chief sought reimbursement for $ 480,000 in expenses (about $ 17 million today).
Mr. Kitman also wrote about Washington in "The Making of the Prefident 1789" (1989), which exposed the political machinations behind Washington's nonpartisan election -- and incidentally, with the unorthodox spelling of its title, satirized the writing style of the era.
His first book was the audaciously titled "The Number One Best Seller: The True Adventures of Marvin Kitman," published in 1966. His last was "Gullible's Travels: A Comical History of the Trump Era," published in 2020.
One of the liberal Mr. Kitman's more surprising works was "The Man Who Would Not Shut Up: The Rise of Bill O'Reilly" (2007), which Jacob Heilbrunn, reviewing it for The Times, pronounced "a mash note" to Mr. O'Reilly, noting that Mr. Kitman saw the pugnacious conservative culture warrior as "a potent (and welcome) antidote to the pap served up for decades by the television industry."
Still, Mr. Heilbrunn wrote, the book ultimately revealed that Mr. O'Reilly's work was less about conservative ideas than about "parading his seething personal resentments in order to become the very thing he purports to despise: a celebrity."
Publishers Weekly wrote that it was "difficult to imagine a better researched or less biased work about such a divisive figure as O'Reilly."
Mr. Kitman was no stranger to the political arena himself. He briefly ran for president in the New Hampshire Republican primary in 1964 under the banner "I would rather be president than write."
When his delegate was reported to have received 638 votes in the primary, more than half as many as went to the perennial candidate Harold Stassen, Mr. Kitman demanded a recount. "There was some kind of fraud in my getting so many," he complained.
Had his mock campaign in 1964 actually succeeded, he could have faced the Democratic incumbent, President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose press secretary was Bill Moyers -- who, as Newsday's publisher in 1969, recruited Mr. Kitman.
"I hired Marvin," Mr. Moyers said in an email, "because we needed his wit, without which a media critic is a warrior without a sword."
"In the early days of television -- the '50s and '60s -- he thought the sure way to coax television to fulfill its cultural and creative possibilities was through satire," Mr. Moyers added. "How could the big moguls in their plush counting houses high above Manhattan not read a guy who wrote that 'on the TV screen pure drivel tends to drive out ordinary drivel'?"
Marvin Kitman was born on Nov, 24, 1929, in Pittsburgh to Jewish immigrants from Russia. His family moved to New York in the 1930s. His father, Myer, was an inspector and clerk for Western Union. His mother, Rose (Kaufman) Kitman, worked at a glider factory in Brooklyn during World War II.
"Some parents send their kids to Switzerland 'for finishing,"' Mr. Kitman often said. "Mine brought me to Brooklyn."
After graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, he attended the City College of New York. He parents hoped he would become a draftsman but he discovered a facility for writing when he worked on the student newspaper. He graduated in 1953 with a bachelor's degree in English.
In 1951, Mr. Kitman married Carolyne Sibushnick, who later became a photographer. In addition to his son, she survives him, along with their daughters, Suzy Kitman and A.J. Knight, and three grandchildren.
After being drafted into the Army, Mr. Kitman served as a sportswriter on the base newspaper at Fort Dix in New Jersey from 1953 to 1955. He then moved to Leonia, N.J., where he worked as a freelance writer, writing a column for a horse racing tout sheet and consumer advocacy articles for the underground humor magazine The Realist.
He was a founding editor, with Victor Navasky, of the satirical magazine Monocle, and a staff writer for The Saturday Evening Post.
He later appeared on TV as a critic for WPIX and WNEW (now WNYW) in New York. He found himself no less disillusioned with broadcast television after working in the medium himself than he had been when writing about it. Particularly dispiriting was his experience helping to create and write a short-lived CBS sitcom titled "Ball Four" with the former major league pitcher Jim Bouton (who also starred, as a fictionalized version of himself) and the sportswriter Vic Ziegel, based on Mr. Bouton's book of the same name.
"It was the constant rewriting at night, how everyone was always so exhausted," he recalled to The Record of Bergen County, N.J., in 2013, "and the input from the executives -- all they knew about writing was the alphabet."
He went on to write for The Huffington Post and in 2013 began his own blog at marvinkitman.com, in which he expounded Marshall McLuhan-like on the anthropological impact of television. "Our kidneys had changed," he wrote. "We had to go to the bathroom more often, like during the commercial breaks."
Resorting to his accustomed modesty, Mr. Kitman, tongue planted firmly in cheek, also soliloquized on his bona fides as a constructive critic rather than a chronic kvetch.
"Thirty-five years of telling the commercial networks they were steering into an iceberg is the reason they are not being threatened today by cable, Netflix and everybody else streaming on hand-held devices, including the electric toothbrush. (Have you ever tried watching TV on it?)," he wrote in 2013.
"The dinosaurs," he added, "are dancing as fast as they can into the La Brea Tar Pits in L.A. and no longer need my help."

With a Crackdown on Membership Sharing, Costco Is Eliminating a Popular Shopping Secret: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The wholesale retailer announced on Wednesday that it will require identification at all registers, including self-checkout lanes, eliminating a popular shopping secret.
The success of Costco's business model relies on rigor. The wholesale retailer, which uses a membership system, strictly monitors entrances and exits and double checks customer receipts.
But for friends and relatives of members, there was a well-known hack for scoring Costco's low prices without paying an annual fee: the self-checkout lanes. Some users found they could borrow a member's card, or a member's QR code from the Costco app, and avoid the identification requirements of the regular checkout lanes.
That workaround is coming to an end. The company said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that it had noticed that nonmember shoppers had been using other people's membership cards, which according to Costco policy are nontransferable, in the self-checkout lanes.
"We are now asking to see their membership card with their photo at our self-service checkout registers," the company explained, adding, "If their membership card does not have a photo, then we ask for a photo ID."
Costco is beloved by consumers for its $ 1.50 hot dog-and-soda combo, towering rows of inexpensive bulk goods and its signature Kirkland brand products -- everything from linens to liquor. A regular membership costs $ 60 a year, and an executive card costs $ 120 a year.
Katie Thomas, who leads the Kearney Consumer Institute, a management consulting firm, said it was a "not unreasonable hack" for occasional shoppers to borrow a friend's Costco card or QR code, adding that she thought it could lead to new paid memberships. Ms. Thomas said she herself was recently scolded at a Costco for using her mother's membership card, though she said she was also a member.
Costco said in its statement that it was "able to keep our prices as low as possible because our membership fees help offset our operational expenses, making our membership fee and structure important to us."
The retail market has grown tighter, said Neil Saunders, managing director at the retail consulting firm GlobalData, who guessed that reasons for the crackdown at Costco might include increasing pressures on corporate margins and the rising cost of commodities, labor and overhead for wholesalers.
"They probably turned a blind eye to it whilst growth and everything was looking rosy," he said, but are becoming stricter in a more difficult economic environment.
Though Costco faced supply constraints and labor shortages during the pandemic, it reported strong operating results for 2022 in an annual report that also boasted about new items, including "BBQ pellets, women's jeans, reformulated dog food, sauté pans, fresh mini cakes and chicken yakisoba."
The company also reported that it had nearly 119 million cardholders last year. Revenue from those membership fees totaled $ 4.2 billion in 2022, up 9 percent from 2021. Costco's net income was $ 5.8 billion last year, the company reported, up from $ 5 billion in 2021.
"You see the importance of the membership model," Mr. Saunders said.
The member renewal rate was around 90 percent worldwide in 2022, the company said. Costco has not raised the cost of its membership since 2017, but executives indicated in a recent earnings call that the cost might increase.
Ms. Thomas pointed out the clear parallel to Netflix, which announced last month that it would begin kicking people off the service if they were using someone's account for more than 30 days while at a different location, attributing its crackdown to shifting economic forces and increased competition.
Costco said on Wednesday, "We don't feel it's right that nonmembers receive the same benefits and pricing as our members."

The Growing Industry Of 'Adventure Tourism' Inspires New Insurance: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some offer evacuations and others provide coverage for accidental death or injury to cater to the growing adventure tourism market.
The tragic deaths of five people on a tour to see the Titanic shipwreck this week have put the risks of extreme travel into focus. But despite the dangers, travel to out-there locations like the South Pole, remote mountaintops, shark-infested waters and space is becoming more popular.
Adventure tourism is expected to bring in more than $ 1 trillion of revenue globally by 2030, up from an expected $ 316.6 billion in 2022, according to the market research firm Grand View Research.
And as interest grows, so, too, will the number of search and rescue missions, says Mikki Hastings, president of the National Association for Search and Rescue. "Whether it's space or Everest, every person deserves to be found," she said.
The number of businesses aiming to mitigate the danger and potential emergency costs of extreme travel are starting to rise. Some offer rescue and medical evacuation from remote locations. Others are working out new types of insurance policies for pursuits like space travel.
Traditional travel insurance won't swoop in with paramedics, even though it typically covers the cost of an emergency. Dan Richards, the chief executive of Global Rescue, told DealBook that he wanted to fill that gap when he founded the emergency travel management company in 2004. For a $ 360 annual fee, it provides members with evacuation services. Upgrades, including one that promises "military special operations veterans" will retrieve you from dangerous locations like war zones, can raise the fee to about $ 1,800. Similarly, Medjet, a medical evacuation service, sells annual memberships, and companies like AirMed International, SkyMed and others offer emergency extractions.
Travel insurance is going to space. With companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic selling tickets for trips, the market for space tourism is expected to grow to about $ 3 billion by 2030, according to estimates from UBS. The space travel insurance market is still small, but Lloyd's of London, which insures space businesses, began underwriting space travel insurance in 2021, and last year the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance said they would jointly develop space insurance offerings.
Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for some rescues. The cost of search and rescue typically falls on state and local agencies, Ms. Hastings said. About a half-dozen states have laws that allow agencies to charge a rescue recipient, though few do, and there is no cost to those rescued by the federal park services, for example. Last year, lawmakers from Hawaii and Utah introduced legislation to allocate federal funds to help states pay for search and rescue operations, a burden that the drafters said disproportionately fell on less populous places, but the bill failed to gain traction.
The search for the submersible this week most likely cost millions of dollars. The Coast Guard, which led the rescue effort, has jurisdiction over search and rescue in navigable waters in the United States and beyond. "But that's just the definition of their mission," Ms. Hastings argues. "We don't encourage charging for search and rescue because we want people to seek help regardless of socioeconomic status."
Mr. Richards said a client of Global Rescue had signed up for the Titan trip this week, but withdrew his deposit because of safety concerns. Though his team would have worked with international rescuers if the customer had followed through with his plans, the company would not have had the requisite deep sea capabilities. There are some journeys where risk can't really be mitigated yet, he said, adding, "If there's an emergency in space, no one will be able to necessarily reach people." -- Ephrat Livni
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Saudi Arabia goes shopping in Europe. Executives and government officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, blitzed Paris this week as part of a road show to attract investment and make its case to host the World Expo in 2030. The oil-rich kingdom has been on a push to diversify its economy and expand its global presence, through investments in a range of sectors including sports.
Lina Khan finally takes on Amazon. The F.T.C. chair shot to fame at the age of 29, when she wrote an academic article criticizing the tech company's dominance of large parts of the American economy. Three years later, her agency has sued Amazon over a different issue: the F.T.C. accused the company of tricking customers into signing up for Prime, its streaming and subscription shopping service.
Musk vs. Zuck? The tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have apparently agreed to a cage fight, after goading each other on social media. Mr. Musk admitted he almost never works out but the Facebook founder has recently taken up Brazilian jujitsu and competed in tournaments and endurance contests.
Prandial Peru. Central, a restaurant in Lima, was crowned the best eatery anywhere by the World's 50 Best Restaurants, one of the most prestigious lists. The venue is known for its creative approach to using domestically produced ingredients and trying to adhere to the traditions and culture of the country.
India's soft power secret
An all-star team from corporate America was in Washington this week for the state visit of India's prime minister, Narendra Modi. And the high number of Indian-American chief executives involved was a demonstration of how the country's diaspora has found a unique place at the nexus of business and political power -- and helped boost the country's image.
The White House dinner was a roll call of top talent. The invite list included the Microsoft chief Satya Nadella; Sundar Pichai, the boss of Alphabet; Arvind Krishna, the head of IBM; the Micron chief Sanjay Mehrotra; and Netflix's chief content officer, Bela Bajaria. Alongside the business leaders were a number of senior government officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother was from South India.
Mr. Modi has made tapping into the diaspora a priority. He has held two huge stadium rallies in the United States since becoming prime minister in 2014 -- at Madison Square Garden that year and the NRG Stadium in Houston in 2019 -- and another in Australia last month. Still, his politics are controversial, and he has been blamed for stoking sectarian violence; in 2005, he was denied a visa to enter the United States when he was chief minister of Gujarat State.
But even if views on Mr. Modi are mixed, the view of India is largely positive. A Pew Research Center survey found 37 percent of Indian Americans had little or no confidence in Mr. Modi compared with 21 percent who did. But more than half of Indian Americans have a more positive view of the country.
Targeting the diaspora is an astute move. Indians are the second biggest immigrant group in the United States and seen as a success story. They have a median household income of almost $ 150,000 a year, the highest of any immigrant groups, and account for a majority of H-1B visas for highly-skilled workers. They also maintain strong links to India, through remittances that surpassed $ 100 billion in 2022, and contacts, cross-border trade and investment.
And their success is a useful form of soft power. Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the term, told The Economist that Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist politics pose a risk to India's reputation, but "if you have people in diaspora who are successful and create a positive image of the country from which they came, that helps their native country."
The greatest hits of Masa Son's wild PowerPoint presentations
SoftBank is known for big moves like introducing the iPhone in Japan and its outsized, and not always successful, bets on start-ups. But its founder, Masa Son, is also famous for his excitable, elaborate and, sometimes, unusual presentations.
His colorful style has been missed in the past year as the chief executive laid low amid the conglomerate's struggling performance. But this week, Mr. Son returned to the public stage at SoftBank's annual shareholder meeting with a new slide deck.
His presentation featured slides that asked big questions -- including "What is Mankind?" -- and the billionaire's story of how he brainstormed investment ideas with ChatGPT at 4 a.m.
Still, to longtime Mr. Son watchers, it's tough to compete with his previous presentations, which were just as memorably offbeat and unabashedly grandiose. (Son relies on a half-dozen young SoftBank employees to draft his presentations, with his direct input, according to Bloomberg.)
Here are some of DealBook's favorites from over the years:
Mr. Son depicted SoftBank as "producer of golden eggs," whose shiny-shelled progeny included investments in Uber, the chip designer Arm and more.
The "valley of coronavirus," a classic, shows SoftBank's winged unicorns -- that is, the herd of start-ups it has invested in -- flying over the economic trough carved out by Covid-19.
Mr. Son explained SoftBank offers "vision capital," not venture capital. Here, Mr. Son also predicted that A.I. would grow companies' market caps so much that those numbers ... simply couldn't be charted.
SoftBank predicted a sharp rebound in WeWork's fortunes, including one of the most hopeful-seeming earnings charts in recent memory.
Mr. Son used pictures of tofu to illustrate SoftBank's profits. (A footnote explains the analogy.)

Full text: Ryan Castalia, the head of the nonprofit "Sure We Can," is also part of an experimental theater group.
In 2018, Ryan Castalia was juggling jobs to support his acting habit when he started working at Sure We Can, a recycling and sustainability hub in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Two years later, he was named the executive director of the nonprofit, which also provides support for canners, or those who collect recyclables for a living.
Canners, most of whom are immigrants, are "essential workers on the front lines of the waste crises working to help clean up our communities for unfair remuneration," Mr. Castalia said. "Someone who does this 12 hours a day, seven days a week, can make a $ 100 a day. It's really hard work for low pay."
The nonprofit is lobbying to pass a new bill that would increase can and bottle deposit refunds from 5 to 10 cents.
Mr. Castalia, 34, lives with his girlfriend, Su Hendrickson, 35, a performer and audiobook narrator, in Flatbush, Brooklyn.
RISE The alarm that came with the iPhone wakes me at 7:30 or 8 a.m. I love to sleep. I'm not a morning person. If I don't get eight hours of sleep, I'm really cranky, so I'm cranky a lot of the time.
BREAKFAST I'll have Raisin Bran with fresh blueberries and 2 percent milk. I don't do caffeine -- it strings me out -- so it's just a big glass of water. Su might still be in bed when I leave or she'll sit with me and eat a belVita. She's a small breakfast eater.
BOOKS, SCRIPTS For the past 10 years, I've been part of an experimental theater group called Dzieci, which is Polish for "children." I pack a bag -- a change of clothes, a drum, journal, maybe a script we're working on, and a book because the train gives me a chance to read, which I love to do. Right now, I'm reading Tony Hillerman's "The Blessing Way," which I took from my parents' house when I visited them in Arizona. It was published in 1970, so parts haven't aged well, like gender attitudes. I just got "The Inhuman" by Jean-François Lyotard. It's a heavy book about the physiological failures of humanism.
TRANSIT I usually ride my single speed Masi road bike everywhere. Biking changed my life. It helped me understand the landscape of the city and have a relationship with the neighborhood. It appeals to my sense of efficiency. But Sundays are a train day. I take the Q to Union Square and then the L to First Avenue.
PROCESS We meet in the back room of the Revision Lounge, a bar in the East Village, where one of the members works. Right now, we're a group of four. I'm the youngest person. Our oldest is 70. As a theater company, we're still learning what life after the pandemic is like. We perform shows, but it's also a process-oriented approach to theater. We work to become more alive, compassionate and sensitive, available and vulnerable. We meditate for 20 minutes, then do a physical exploration, like a small song. We find ways to change it into different tones and idioms while exploring it physically and vocally.
LUNCH BREAK We do a shared lunch, which is part of the practice, where everyone has brought something. Usually it's low-sugar, heathy food. I bring trail mix and roasted turkey from the deli, and pretzels and clementines. We usually end up with a mix of seaweed wraps, hummus and carrots. Bring what you want has backfired on us a few times, sometimes everyone brings hummus.
FOUND FAMILY The work is really therapeutic. It's where I process intense things happening in my life. Maybe I'm struggling with a question about my intimate life or having trouble with a colleague. I may sing or give a piece of text about it. It's a big release of emotion. It's also validating to be seen and heard. These people have become mentors and friends. They're found family.
POOR PLAYERS We usually break out our scripts and refine what we've done or are transforming. Our next play is Macbeth, which we perform at various places, the bar, Sure We Can, or at people's homes. Every actor learns the complete text of the play and we change roles on impulse so it's constantly shifting.
PAUSE At 4 p.m. we close with a silent circle and pause together. It's a meditative ritual. It's a way to return to each other and to be present regardless of what happened during the day.
WORK CHECK-IN I might go to Sure We Can to touch base and catch up on work. We're closed on Sundays, but we make the space available to canners to access their storage. There might be an event or a community meeting. Right now, we're doing a research project to gather demographic data about canners across the city.
BALL, BURGERS I might play basketball at the Parade Ground with my friend Will, who lives nearby. If we go to my place for dinner, it's a frozen pasta from Annie's or Balducci's. We're a little sick of Brooklyn's Natural Deli. I'm a sucker for breakfast food at night. I love a Cheddar and broccoli omelet with toast and jam. Or we order in from Burger UrWay. I'll do a turkey or salmon burger. That can be hit or miss. I can get overwhelmed by too much sauce.
SCREENS Su built a recording studio in the apartment so she can record and edit all day. She might be in the booth recording or watching a K-drama -- it's a specific format of Korean drama. She's watching "Crash Landing on You" on Netflix. Will and I watch basketball or skate videos. I'm also a sucker for Japanese action fantasy role-playing video games like "Dark Souls." It's like "Game of Thrones" but darker and more haunted.
SNACKS At 10 p.m., I get a weird burst of energy and need a snack, like mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's light and decadent. I'm not choosy -- it's Häagen-Dazs from the deli. I'm addicted to eating KIND bars, either dark chocolate almond mint or caramel almond and sea salt. Or a strawberry Nutri-Grain bar, which reminds me of my childhood.
AROUND MIDNIGHT Su is in bed first and winds down with a web comic or K-drama on her phone. I'll play a video game, "Elden Ring," or watch "Hercule Poirot" on PBS. It's perfect for winding down. It's a really formulaic British detective series you don't have to work hard to follow. It's the perfect thing to drift away to, which happens around midnight.

Full text: Jason McDonald became a glassblower knowing that throughout history, there's little to no record of Black glassblowers. He'd like to change that.
Jason McDonald discovered glassblowing more than two decades ago at an after school program in his hometown, Tacoma, Wash. He was 14 at the time, and it was nothing like anything he had ever seen before, he said: immediate, dangerous and sobering.
"It was like magic," he said.
When he was diagnosed with A.D.H.D. at 37, he realized that some things held his attention more than others. And glass artistry was just one of those things that stuck.
The practice of fusing liquid sand into art objects dates back more than 2000 years, and yet there's little to no record of Black glass blowers. "I can count on my fingers and toes the number of professional Black glass artists that I know, and still have some toes leftover," Mr. McDonald said.
He said he has felt the isolation of being the only Black artist in a studio. He has been told by a peer that "you don't belong here," and tolerated emotionally abusive artists. But Mr. McDonald's sense of purpose and drive toward his craft, and for his community, remain urgent.
So when Solange Knowles, the singer-songwriter and multidisciplinary artist, asked Mr. McDonald to collaborate on glassware after someone from her team spotted him on TV, he didn't even have to think about it.
On June 20, Saint Heron, a creative agency and cultural institution founded by Ms. Knowles and named after her 2013 album, released a limited-edition collection of Small Matter Art Objects, designed by Ms. Knowles and produced by Mr. McDonald.
The collection is meant to reveal "the sentience of household objects through the landscape of Black domesticity," according to a news release about it. The pieces cost $ 129 to $ 187 and sold out quickly.
"The Small Matter Glassware Collection both reflects and crystallizes time through material," Ms. Knowles said in the news release. "It was important for our first Small Matter project to be an object designed with Black thought and created by Black hands. I am forever grateful to Jason McDonald's artistry."
The intention behind the first release was simple: to "put well-designed glassware into the hands of people that look like her and I, at a reasonable price point," Mr. McDonald said.
The collection featured five handblown pieces produced in various quantities; there were 198 pieces in total. Mr. McDonald decided against using a mold for this line, which means that every piece is handmade.
He compared it to baking. If you follow a recipe each time, you'll get a very similar result, he said.
Glassblowing manipulates liquid sand, using fire to shape the substance into objects. The natural material is apparent in the Saint Heron designs: earth, almost smokelike tones in modern bulbous silhouettes. Some glasses are more midcentury modern -- solid, sleek -- and glow as they catch the light.
Others are more playful: a short amber glass with raised dots scattered along the goblet, another with a thick cylinder stem with indented lines. It's the elevated auntie glassware that serves as an art piece, as much as a dining set.
Mr. McDonald said his design sense is inspired by 16th-century Venetian furnace techniques -- a marriage of heavily ornamented goblets with intricate stemware. "The collection's design doesn't reflect my interest in glass, but the heart behind it is everything I'm about," he said.
When Mr. McDonald thinks about Black households cherishing the glassware in the hopes of inspiring communal gatherings, as intended by Ms. Knowles, it feels bigger than him.
"I am hoping that folks will kind of get where she's coming from, in that this is designed by Black folks, and not exclusively for Black folks, but with Black folks in mind," he said.
As someone who spends most of his time in a smoky studio, Mr. McDonald finds being in the public eye deeply uncomfortable, he said. Yet he competed in Season 2 of "Blown Away" (a glassblowing reality series on Netflix), recognizing that there are few opportunities in the glass world for Black artists.
"I have to be willing to have a public-facing persona," he said. "You got to grab the opportunity while it's there because there's not a lot of it."
While he doesn't think the Saint Heron collection will change his life overnight, he said, he hopes that his art will be visible to more people, and that it might even put him on Oprah's radar.
After graduating this year with a master's degree in glassblowing from the Tyler School of Art and Architecture in Philadelphia, Mr. McDonald is returning to where it all started, Tacoma, where he plans to try his hand as a self-employed glassmaker. "I'm not working with a Plan B," he said. "So, this is what's happening and I'll succeed or fail, but I think I'll make it."

Full text: For years, Katerina Jeng and Jocelyn Ueng were friends on Instagram. When Ms. Jeng visited Ms. Ueng in Copenhagen in 2021, a 48-hour first date kicked off a long-distance relationship.
In 2018, Jocelyn Carol Ueng would host a five-course themed meal in her loft in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, twice a month for six paying guests at a time. In the hopes of generating publicity for her culinary project, she reached out to an Asian American literary magazine.
Although her pitch to write a story about her business was declined by the magazine, Ms. Ueng became intrigued with Katerina Shiou-Yun Jeng, one of its founders, and decided to follow her on Instagram.
"It was just like, this girl is really cool -- what she's doing is really important for the community," Ms. Ueng said of Ms. Jeng, who was the publication's executive editor.
Soon, they were liking each other's social media posts. "It wasn't out of romance or any form of attraction," Ms. Ueng, 29, said.
And Ms. Jeng, 31, who lived in Denver, was in a relationship. "At the time, I thought I was straight," said Ms. Jeng, who uses they/them pronouns.
The online friendship continued after Ms. Ueng left Brooklyn in 2020 to attend the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena, Calif. After graduating, Ms. Ueng helped found Wave Health, a now-defunct online platform providing access to psychedelic therapists. She reached out to Ms. Jeng to see if they'd be interested in participating in a research trial involving psychedelics, from January to June 2021.
On a monthly video call about the trial, Ms. Ueng mentioned to Ms. Jeng that she was moving to Copenhagen for an internship at Noma, a Danish restaurant. Ms. Jeng, who by then was single, asked, "Can I come?"
Ms. Jeng landed in Copenhagen in late October to meet Ms. Ueng in person for the first time. They acquired the keys to Ms. Ueng's apartment from a lockbox and immediately felt at home upon entry.
While Ms. Ueng was at work, Ms. Jeng explored the home and peeked into their hostess's closet. "The apartment was just a vibe," Ms. Jeng said. "The outfits were on point. I was like, 'This is the whole package."'
But there was one detail that still remained a mystery. "I didn't even know if she was queer," Ms. Jeng said.
That weekend, while they were visiting the Garden of the Royal Library in Copenhagen, Ms. Jeng admitted that they liked Ms. Ueng.
"We went to Frederiksborg Castle, and under an archway of trees in its perfectly manicured baroque garden, she said, 'I'm going to be a hopeless romantic and ask you for our first kiss,"' Ms. Jeng said. When the weeklong visit ended, they were both committed to a long-distance relationship.
Ms. Ueng, who grew up in Hacienda Heights, Calif., has a bachelor's degree in management science from the University of California San Diego. While working as a digital strategy consultant in New York, she started Playtes, her former culinary business. Then, Ms. Ueng earned an associate degree in culinary arts from the Culinary Institute of America. She is now a chef de partie, or station chef, at Noma in Copenhagen.
Ms. Jeng, who grew up in Old Westbury, N.Y., has a bachelor's in both English and music from Cornell. They became a co-founder of an Asian American creative collective and helped lead it for five years. And then in 2018, they helped start Spectacle, a marketing and communications agency, which advises businesses on inclusive marketing. Ms. Jeng is also working on their first poetry book.
On Valentine's Day 2022, during a virtual date over FaceTime, Ms. Ueng shared that she could imagine spending the rest of her life with Ms. Jeng.

Ms. Jeng proposed on July 9, 2022, after a light rainstorm at Britzer Garten in Berlin, where the two were vacationing. Ms. Jeng recited a poem they had written on 10 things they loved about Ms. Ueng, including the way the two held hands while falling asleep. Then, Ms. Jeng presented a dairy-free chocolate and peanut butter cake decorated with wildflowers and the words "Marry Me?"
On May 25, after a kaiseki meal, Ms. Ueng staged her own proposal with a bouquet of wildflowers and a wagashi cake in the couple's room at Satoyama Jujo, a luxury hotel in Niigata, Japan. Ms. Ueng had been sent to Japan to work at a Noma pop-up restaurant.
The couple eloped on June 7 at the site of their first date: the Garden of the Royal Library in Copenhagen. During a 15-minute ceremony, they exchanged vows while Pernille Sorensen, a registrar assigned by the city, officiated. For now, Ms. Jeng will continue to reside in Denver and visit Ms. Ueng in Copenhagen for the next year and a half.
After enjoying cake, taking photos, blowing bubbles and visiting the beach, the couple called their families on FaceTime. Then at Ms. Ueng's apartment, they watched the Netflix show "The Ultimatum: Queer Love" and made the noodle dish zha jiang mian.
Later, they shared a first dance to "You Send Me" by Aretha Franklin. "I was wearing my T-shirt and no pants," Ms. Jeng said. "It was perfect -- there was nothing I would have changed."

Full text: Friday
2:30 p.m. | Take time for tea
Start your weekend with afternoon tea at No. 15 by GuestHouse, a hotel in Bathwick (the area across the River Avon from the city's historic center) that occupies three adjoining Georgian townhouses. In the bar, where afternoon tea is served, glass-topped tables reveal colorful jewels displayed under their surfaces, and locally commissioned art hangs on the walls alongside theater programs from the 1800s. Afternoon tea (£35 per person) may include sandwiches with cave-aged Cheddar, a refreshing jelly made with Aperol and clementines, and lemon macarons, along with seven other dishes. Arrive hungry.
4 p.m. | Shop with independents
Walking from Bathwick to the city center will take you to Pulteney Bridge, which was completed in 1774 and is a rare example of a bridge with storefronts built along both sides. On the east side of the river, Bathwick Pharmacy is worth visiting for its elegant 1826 interior and a display of old dispensary bottles and jars. Nearby, the Antique Map Shop (closes at 4:30 p.m.) sells maps of the British Isles, Europe and the Americas; most are over a century old, and many are annotated in copperplate handwriting and decorated with mythical creatures and the coats of arms of landowners. Over the bridge, Independent Spirit of Bath has spirits, wines, beers and mead by local producers -- look for Bath Botanical No 1. Gin (£37.95), a classic London dry-style made in Bath.
5 p.m. | Visit the Roman baths
By making it in time for the last entry into the Roman Baths (£26), now a museum in the center of the city, you can catch the peace between daytime bustle and nightlife, even if there is no swimming allowed. Steaming spring water flows into the lead-lined pool that was originally built by the Romans around A.D. 60, when the town was known as Aquae Sulis, and resurrected by the Victorians, who discovered its ruins. The surrounding columns and walls provide a wheat-colored backdrop to the light green water, tinted by algae. See the Bath curse tablets on display -- metal sheets inscribed in British Latin with curses asking for the goddess Sulis Minerva to mete out punishment against thieves.
7:30 p.m. | Indulge in oenophilia
At Corkage, spend an evening perusing the wine list one glass at a time (from £5.75), either inside the bar, where the walls are decorated with old posters and shelves lined with bottles, or on the canopy-covered terrace, where lights and vines sprawl around the wooden beams. There is no need to be knowledgeable about wine to enjoy it here, and the waiters are happy to give recommendations. The menu of small plates (from £6 to £22), is perfectly sized for grazing. You can even buy a bottle to take home.
Saturday
10 a.m. | Step into another time
Inside No 1. Royal Crescent, a museum in a restored townhouse, period furnishings and a soundscape of imagined conversations between family members and staff convey a sense of life in the Georgian era. The characters discuss objects on display and concerns of the time: A fossilized mollusk prompts a discussion of creation and evolution. Talk of a slave rebellion in Jamaica and how it may affect the family's income offers a window into how opulent Georgian life was supported by products of slavery in the colonies, as well as industrial labor by the working class. Admission is £15, or £22 for combined entry into the Herschel Museum of Astronomy.
11:30 a.m. | stroll in the gardens
Pop into the Green Bird Cafe for a coffee or a snack before taking an hourlong stroll through scenic streets and parks. Start with the Royal Crescent's curved sweep of Palladian-style townhouses, which are immortalized in the Netflix film "Persuasion," based on the Jane Austen novel of the same name. Walk through Royal Victoria Park and its botanical gardens, where paths pass flower beds and a stream. Continue uphill along Cavendish Road, where you will see villa-style houses built in the 19th century, when a wealthy mercantile class began constructing permanent homes in Bath. In Lansdown Crescent, you can still occasionally see sheep grazing against a backdrop of trees and distant hills, and the city is almost obscured. Head downhill on Lansdown Road and then cut through Hedgemead Park to reach Walcot Street.
12:30 p.m. | Make a glass bauble
Walcot Street, which formed part of the road network during Roman times, has resisted urban development and corporate incursion to remain a home for artistic and independent endeavors. At the Bath Aqua Glass studio, you can blow your own glass bauble to take home (£22.50). Walking south, pass the Bell Inn and check the quirky live music schedule for anything appealing to see later. The pub is a customer-and-worker-owned cooperative, operating for the benefit of the community. Continue south to find Dangleberg, a shrine to spicy or fermented condiments, including blends and hot sauce, and the Yellow Shop, where both vintage and new clothes evoke nostalgia for decades past.
2 p.m. | Taste the West Country
Cheddar is the most famous cheese of Somerset, the county that encompasses Bath, and the sharpest renditions of Cheddar are a product of the green pastures nurtured by West Country rains combined with cave maturation. The Fine Cheese Co., on Walcot Street, sells cheeses made by small European producers who use traditional methods, although British cheeses are the highlight. Local varieties worth tasting include Bath Blue, which is made from herds on the nearby Mendip Hills, as well as Pitchfork Cheddar, which is dense and savory. Have a platter of your choice of three cheeses for £13, or try the staff's selection for £11, and enjoy in the shop's cafe.
3:30 p.m. | Ponder Mary Shelley
The author Mary Shelley stayed in Bath for five months, from 1816 to 1817, attending scientific lectures. By the time she left, most of "Frankenstein" was written. (Many say the novel started the modern science fiction genre.) Mary Shelley's House of Frankenstein (entry £17.50), a museum that opened in 2021 near Queen Square, explores Shelley's life and the time she spent in Bath, as well as her influences and her legacy. Gothic imagery guides you through her complicated romantic life, which led to social ostracism, and her loss of three children and her husband by the time she was 24. Basement rooms add to the creepy experience by pushing you through bad smells and weird textures while someone lurks in costume. Upstairs, explore the vast quantity of films and memorabilia inspired by the book.
5 p.m. | Soak in the famous water
Experience the naturally heated water that has brought visitors to the area for millenniums. The multifloor Thermae Bath Spa, near the Roman Baths, offers bathers a variety of geothermal pools. In the basement Minerva pool, sit in a bubbling hot tub that you have to swim to reach, or allow the currents to move you around the surrounding pool. The Wellness Suite offers a number of spa experiences, including heated loungers, scented steam rooms, an infrared sauna and an ice chamber for cooling down. Finish your journey at the rooftop pool, where you can take in the city views. (Two-hour sessions, from £45 on weekends. Massages and spa treatments are available for an extra charge.)
8 p.m. | Surrender to taste
Visitors to the Elder, a restaurant on South Parade serving seasonal British fare, will notice that the dining room is painted a shade of celadon that evokes the water of the Roman Baths. The celebration of heritage extends to the table with dishes like Bath Chaps (£12), a traditional cut of pork that is brined, bread-crumbed and fried. (The tasting menu, £85 for seven courses, is a good value.) While the Elder is excellent for omnivores, Oak, an outstanding restaurant on nearby North Parade, is entirely vegetarian -- and mostly vegan -- and grows some of its own produce. While Oak offers a five-course set menu at a very reasonable £49, with matched wines for an additional £26, both restaurants have à la carte menus as well.
Sunday
10 a.m. | See the cosmos
At the Herschel Museum of Astronomy, west of the city center, you can stand where the known edge of the solar system expanded when the astronomer William Herschel set up his homemade telescope and discovered a new planet: Uranus. Occupying the house that he and Caroline Herschel, his sister and a fellow astronomer, lived in for five years, the museum offers a glimpse of late-18th-century middle-class life and charts the advance of astronomy. Satirical prints of the time portray stargazing as a hobby of the Enlightenment and mock Caroline, who was an anomaly as an unmarried and educated female scientist. Despite this, she discovered several comets and is thought to be the first woman paid to be an astronomer. Entry is £12, or combined with entry to No. 1 Royal Crescent, £22.
11:30 a.m. | savor the river
The River Avon, which loops around Bath and connects to London via the Kennet and Avon Canal, is a place for recreation. Go for a paddle with Original Wild, a local outdoor adventure company, either by kayak or stand-up paddleboard (£36 for two hours). Architecture and wildlife come together when you spot the peregrine falcons that nest on St. John the Evangelist, a tall, Victorian, Gothic-style church. Guides also share unusual facts about Bath: For instance, they may point out a riverbank spot where you can slip an arm into cool river water to feel a warm current emerging. The warmth comes from the restored floor of Bath Abbey, a seventh-century church, which is now heated using Bath's thermal springs.

How a Cloning Fraud Reinvented Himself: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Science is known for rigorous self-policing by the research community, yet it can seem that scientific fraud is rampant. Why do frauds think they can get away with it?
The story of Hwang Woo-suk, a South Korean scientist who gained notoriety for claiming to clone human embryos, provides clues. After leaving the field in disgrace, he has landed in clover and now spends his days cloning beauty show and racing camels for United Arab Emirates royalty.
Dr. Hwang's story is re-entering the public eye nearly 20 years after his fall from grace with two new documentaries, on Netflix and YouTube. His improbable career should prompt reassessment of popular assumptions about the effectiveness of science's supposed self-correcting system and recognition of the ways in which it can fail to deter or discipline misconduct.
Dr. Hwang burst into the spotlight in 2004 when he reported success in making an embryonic human clone and deriving stem cells from it. This was the proof of principle for the once-hyped therapeutic cloning -- in which patients' own cells, from the skin or other tissue, could be used to create embryonic stem cells with their genetic signature, which could then be used to treat diseases.
The distance to the clinic shrank with Dr. Hwang's 2005 follow-up study. The team claimed to have made embryonic stem cells from nine patients using a much more efficient protocol than the previous report. The apparent breakthrough won him widespread acclaim. South Korea named him a "supreme scientist" and released a postage stamp to celebrate his achievement.
But all was not well in the clone factory, as Dr. Hwang's lab at Seoul National University had come to be known. As a journalist covering his ascendance for Nature, I was the first to report ethical breaches involving the team's sourcing of human eggs.
Eggs are a critical part of cloning, and Dr. Hwang's prodigious supply of them, which he claimed were from unpaid volunteers, was what set him apart from other scientists. But during an interview, a graduate student in his lab told me that she and another student had donated their own eggs to the research program.
Investigations after Dr. Hwang's downfall revealed that the other student had performed the cloning attempts herself. "Though it was I who started it, I'm scared," she wrote to a friend just before the procedure. "General anesthesia, self-cloning. (It's inconceivable? Cloning using my own eggs? How tough I am.)" She added, "I shouldn't have done it this way, not giving up until the end, not standing up to the professor. I will work harder to forgive myself." Other eggs were bought, which went against ethical guidelines.
Dr. Hwang denied wrongdoing. But months after his 2005 report, a courageous South Korean news team provided evidence that stretched from unethical egg procurement to fraud. The journalists persevered despite threats, withdrawal of sponsors and finally cancellation of the program.
By the following year, both of Dr. Hwang's once-heralded papers were retracted, the cloning factory was shut down, and he was indicted on charges of fraud, violation of the country's bioethics law and embezzlement. "This gentleman's career and probably his life is ruined," David Scadden, a doctor and acclaimed stem cell researcher at Harvard, told an American news program.
But a seemingly less important breakthrough by Dr. Hwang's team, reported just before the human cloning story unraveled, held the keys to his future: the first cloning of a dog. Various other species, from sheep to mice, had been cloned, but domestic species such as cats and dogs had proved a challenge. With the largess bestowed on the "supreme scientist," his colleagues had succeeded, after more than 1,000 attempts, to bring a cloned Afghan hound puppy named Snuppy into the world.
In 2006, while investigations into the human stem cell cloning scandal were underway, Dr. Hwang founded Sooam Biotech Research Foundation, a private dog-cloning enterprise, with financial support from his die-hard fans in the industry. Its clientele included police K-9 units and bereaved pet owners. Business was good.
Over the next decade, Dr. Hwang's name was associated with a string of animal cloning efforts, from various barnyard animals for ramped-up livestock breeding to the genetic rescue of nearly extinct species like the Ethiopian wolf to implausible attempts to bring extinct species such as the woolly mammoth back from the evolutionary graveyard.
Most of these projects seem to have fizzled. But they did return an air of authority to Dr. Hwang's name.
In 2010 a beloved champion show camel in Abu Dhabi named Mabrokan suddenly died. Researchers in Dubai reported the first cloned camel the previous year, and veterinarians in Abu Dhabi had the foresight to cryopreserve some testicular tissue and skin in the hope that they could find some cloning help.
In 2021 a group led by Dr. Hwang produced 11 clones of Mabrokan. He now heads a state-of-the-art cloning laboratory in the desert around Abu Dhabi and lives in a villa on the grounds of a seven-star hotel where he takes daily swims.
There was another possible ending to this story -- one in which Dr. Hwang's fraudulent research was never retracted, he kept his academic post and he was remembered as the first to clone humans for therapeutic purposes. Science's vaunted self-correcting mechanism, wherein other scientists try to replicate experiments and, if they fail, strike the findings from the record, did not work in this case. His low success rate with human eggs meant that a complete failure by another group could have been written off as inferior technique, poor egg quality or just bad luck.
Dr. Hwang's first human therapeutic cloning paper could have joined the ranks of numerous other prominent stem cell claims that other scientists cannot replicate but also cannot disprove. Groundbreaking scientific claims await broad acceptance or rejection. Some never leave that state of limbo.
The Hwang saga is illustrative of the serious deficiencies in the self-regulation of science. His fraud was uncovered because of brave South Korean television reporters. Even those efforts might not have been enough, had Dr. Hwang's team not been so sloppy in its fraud. The team's papers included fabricated data and pairs of images that on close comparison clearly indicated duplicity.
Yet as a cautionary tale about the price of fraud, it is, unfortunately, a mixed bag. He lost his academic standing, and he was convicted of bioethical violations and embezzlement, but he never ended up serving time. Although his efforts at cloning human embryos ended in failure and fraud, they provided him the opportunities and resources he needed to take on other projects, such as dog cloning, that were beyond the reach of other labs. The fame he earned in academia proved an asset in a business world where there's no such thing as bad press.
Fraudulent scientists and technological fake-it-till-you-make-it scammers like the Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, who just started a prison term for defrauding investors with spurious claims about blood testing technology, make for intriguing headlines. When such crimes are discovered and prosecuted, it is comforting to think that scientific truth inevitably emerges and scientific frauds will be caught and punished.
But that is not always the case, and Dr. Hwang's scandal suggests something different. Researchers don't always have the resources or motivation to replicate others' experiments. Even if they try to replicate and fail, it is the institution where the scientist works that has the right and responsibility to investigate possible fraud. Research institutes and universities, facing the prospect of an embarrassing scandal, might not do so.
The job of surfacing the fraud has all too often fallen to journalists, a new class of recreational fraud-monitoring sleuths or even the occasional profit-driven short seller who wants to ensure that a hyped claim collapses. Their sporadic efforts do not add up to a reliable mechanism. In Dr. Hwang's case, not only did the sloppy fraud and egregious bioethical transgressions get past the bioethical and scientific vetting mechanisms; evidence journalists worked hard to get was very nearly buried.
Rather than a comforting tale about justice being served, this scandal suggests that science's sentinel systems are limited in their ability to catch misconduct -- and that there are likely to be many more frauds out there that we don't know about.
David Cyranoski (@Cyranoski) was the Asia-Pacific correspondent for the science journal Nature from 2000 to 2021, where he frequently covered episodes of scientific fraud. Currently he researches the history of science and the impact of science on society at Kyoto University's Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Biology. He lives in Kyoto.

Full text: Hoping to make this a memorable weekend? Listen to what's new at the Emerging Music and Jazztopad Festivals, or hop aboard the "Shanghai Express."
Comedy
Gina Yashere
June 24 at 7 p.m. at the Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Brooklyn; thebellhouseny.com.
Gina Yashere's American success story was not an overnight one. Born and raised in London to Nigerian parents, Yashere first appeared on TV in the States as a finalist on NBC's "Last Comic Standing" in 2007. A Showtime special followed in 2010, as well as a brief stint on "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah" in 2017. But in 2019, she struck gold teaming up with Chuck Lorre to create the CBS sitcom "Bob Hearts Abishola," for which she's also a showrunner and appears onscreen as Kemi. Last June for Pride Month, Yashere spoke on "CBS Mornings" about how pride "is the antidote to shame."
This Saturday, she headlines the Bell House amid a Pride-themed weekend, which also includes "Corporate Pride" hosted by Tessa Skara and Jes Tom on Friday, and "The Lesbian Agenda With Sophie Santos: Pride Edition!" on Sunday. Tickets for Yashere are $ 25 and available through Eventbrite. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Emerging Music Festival
June 23 at 7 p.m. and June 24 at 5 p.m. at Bryant Park, Manhattan; bryantpark.org.
The summer festival circuit is flooded with big-name touring acts. But this two-day showcase, organized by the indie promoter AdHoc, focuses instead on emerging, predominantly local talent. Anchoring Friday's lineup is Katy Kirby, who writes sharply observant, tenderhearted folk rock. On "Cool Dry Place," Kirby's 2021 debut, her bright, imagistic lyrics spill like paint onto a neutral canvas of ambling guitar. The rock trio Thus Love and the funk-pop group Psymon Spine share the bill.
Saturday's lengthier program includes Miss Grit, a former music technology student at New York University whose indie-rock recording project resulted in a high-concept debut, "Follow the Cyborg," this year. Leaning into digital, both musically and thematically, the album considers the cyborg as a symbol of resistance to oppressive social scripts. Ky Vöss, another artist who embraces cyber-pop aesthetics, will also perform, along with the post-punk band Dead Tooth and others.
Admission to the festival is free and first come first served. OLIVIA HORN
Jazztopad Festival
June 23-30 at various locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan; instytutpolski.pl/newyork.
Illuminating intersections between jazz, contemporary classical, electronic and other music without borders, Poland's Jazztopad Festival returns to New York for the seventh time with sets from genre-expanding artists in Brooklyn this weekend and at Dizzy's Club and Lincoln Center's David Rubenstein Atrium in Manhattan early next week.
This Friday, the celebrated trumpeter and composer Amir ElSaffar, who explores vital connections between jazz and Arabic music, performs in a trio at FourOneOne at 8 p.m. The pianist Craig Taborn, a master of improvisation and electronics, plays solo, in a duo, and with the strings of the Lutoslawski Quartet at National Sawdust at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, premiering the first part of "Luminous Grid," a concert-length work inspired by the abstract painter Agnes Martin. Sunday night at Barbès at 8 p.m. includes performances from, among others, the pianist Joanna Duda, a rhythmic experimenter who provided a score for Netflix's first commissioned Polish film, "Erotica 2022." Duda's bracing trio also performs Tuesday at Dizzy's Club at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. Ticket prices vary by venue. ALAN SCHERSTUHL
Kids
NYC KidsFest
June 23-25, 2-7 p.m., at various locations in Manhattan; nyckidsfest.org.
Although summer in New York is filled with festivals, they don't necessarily cater to the city's youngest residents. This weekend, however, families can rejoice: Several free celebrations are expressly for children.
NYC KidsFest is bigger than ever, with events over three days in Harlem: on Friday in the Richard Rodgers Amphitheater of Marcus Garvey Park, on Saturday at Lafayette Square and on Sunday at the Jackie Robinson Bandshell in Jackie Robinson Park.
Each day will feature instruction from the group Double Dutch Dreamz on how to create jump-rope joy on the pavement, as well as a performance and workshop by the Harlem Swing Dance Society and an interactive show from Galli Theater New York. Other attractions include a kung fu master class with the New York Chinese Cultural Center on Saturday and a concert by the singer-songwriter Flor Bromley on Sunday.
Prefer indoor fun? Head to the Queens International Children's Festival on Saturday and Sunday at the Jamaica Performing Arts Center for music, theater and dance.
And for adolescents, Youth Pride on Saturday in Domino Park, Brooklyn, will feature all-day entertainment and art-making celebrating L.G.B.T.Q. kids. (Registration is required.) LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
'Shanghai Express'
June 24-25 at Nitehawk Cinema Prospect Park, 188 Prospect Park West, Brooklyn; nitehawkcinema.com.
The highlight of any film from the director Josef von Sternberg is never the plot, but von Sternberg's ethereal, strangely tactile imagery, which is thick with smoke, glass and fabrics. Writing in The New York Times in 2010, Dave Kehr, now a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, cited a story -- "probably apocryphal" -- that the director had "once suggested his movies be projected upside down, so that audiences wouldn't be distracted from the sublime play of light and shadow on the screen."
So while "Shanghai Express," from 1932, with Marlene Dietrich, Anna May Wong and Clive Brook as passengers aboard a Shanghai-bound train in war-torn China, lays a strong claim to being von Sternberg's most purely entertaining film, it is also, like most of his work, a movie that demands to be watched as a physical object. Nitehawk Cinema Prospect Park is screening it twice, on Saturday and Sunday at noon, on a 35-millimeter print. BEN KENIGSBERG

Filmmaker's Agile Master Of Ingenuity: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sami brings ingenious design, a D.I.Y. spirit and pure athletic ability to the job of key grip -- pushing and pulling heavy camera rigs with exacting precision.
Wes Anderson's intricate films are known for their jewel box sets, vibrant costumes and starry ensemble casts. But there's another element that gives his movies their distinctive look and feel, and it comes in the form of a 52-year-old grip.
Sanjay Sami, a native of Mumbai, India, got his start on Bollywood movies and has been working with Anderson since 2006, mostly as a dolly grip. It's a rough job, pushing and pulling a camera mounted on a dolly -- a setup weighing up to 900 pounds -- along hundreds of feet of track built for a scene, and Sami has engineered, invented and refined it into an art form.
On a typical movie, a dolly might move the camera left to right or back and forth. In the Wesiverse, it goes in all those directions -- and sometimes up and down, too -- in a single tracking shot, allowing, Anderson said, for unbroken expression. "It means the actors can stay in real time, and you can create something that really exists, in front of the camera."
Equal parts ingenious designer, D.I.Y. repair guru, rail engineer, cineaste and athlete, Sami is, according to many cast and crew members, Anderson's secret weapon.
"He can masterfully execute the most intricate camera moves I've ever seen," said Adrien Brody, a frequent Anderson star, who called Sami "exacting and relentless and extremely devoted."
Last year, on "The French Dispatch," Sami executed the most complicated shot of his career, a 70-second walk-and-talk through an unusually active police station, performed as a monologue by Jeffrey Wright, with the dolly speeding up and slowing down to keep pace with his clipped delivery.
This year, Sami topped that with a scene in "Asteroid City," Anderson's latest, in which Brody moves through a long theater space in an exquisitely detailed choreography of sets, props, walls, actors, dialogue and camera, which "has to come off of a set of tracks and then be loaded seamlessly onto another set of tracks and hit numerous precise marks at very specific timings," Brody noted.
Another complex moment came early on in "Asteroid City," filmed in Spain and set in an eerie, midcentury Southwestern landscape. Wright, playing a general, gives a speech to a young group of astronomers and junior scientists, as the camera moves back and forth and side to side (almost a star pattern) on a triple-layered track, setting the scene and building a sense of Wright's character.
"There's a lot of responsibility, because we are the viewer's eyes," Sami said, in a video interview from his home in Mumbai. "We're moving the emotion and the story, more than just moving the camera."
Anderson sends Sami scripts early on in his projects, and then the animatics -- rough animations that convey the long tracking shots the filmmaker likes. "He's the one who points out, 'This is tricky,"' Anderson said. "He'll express the physics of it to me."
And then Sami bends the usual laws of cinema, inventing a new rig or ordering an unheard-of amount of track, where other filmmakers might resort to green screens or other visual effects. "The thing I love is, with Sanjay, we essentially are using the same equipment that we might have used on a movie 75 years ago," Anderson said, "but we're arranging it in a way that it hasn't been arranged before."
In a scene in "The French Dispatch," for example, Owen Wilson's character arrives riding a bicycle, and the camera tracking him has to quickly start and stop at the same rate that he does -- one of Anderson's visual signatures. "But we're accelerating a huge amount of weight from a standstill on one grip's power, as opposed to a light bicycle that he's already at speed with," Sami said. So he concocted a system involving a bungee cord anchored to a truck that could spring the camera up to the right velocity instantly.
"I think what he likes about working with me is that I hate saying no to anything," said Sami, who has also worked with Christopher Nolan. "No matter how crazy the demand is, I always want to find a solution. Maybe a crazy solution. That's part of what makes my job really interesting."
"Sometimes the crazier the method, the happier he is," he added of Anderson.
Sami has worked on Anderson's commercial projects and every live action film since "The Darjeeling Limited" (2007), when he impressed the filmmaker by devising a way to fit a dolly into the narrow old rail cars they used as a set: he mounted a hidden track on the train's ceiling.
To achieve Anderson's vision, Sami must often run at full speed, weighted down with gear -- a Steadicam, which he also operates, is over 60 pounds -- spin around and come to an abrupt, dizzying halt. "It's 10 or 12 hours of very, very physical work," he said. "It's not just endurance -- you need a huge amount of strength to be able to stop and start those moves, or you're going to hurt yourself."
So he has an exercise regimen of daily resistance training specifically for an Anderson flick. "I used to play rugby, and a lot of the rugby training crosses over," he said.
Before he got into movies, Sami was an industrial diver and underwater welder, working on oil rigs. He got his start in the film industry during a marine contractor strike, when a friend invited him onto a set. "I saw this traveling circus full of crazy people who come together briefly, make a movie. And then it's another movie -- same circus, different clowns," he said. "I loved it." (He also has a degree in political science -- a fanciful enough background that he himself could be a Wes Anderson character: the Life Aquatic, and on the Rails, with Sanjay Sami.)
Collaborating with Adam Stockhausen, Anderson's production designer, and Robert Yeoman, the cinematographer, Sami -- whose official title is key grip, the head of his department -- has an unusual amount of input. "He's sort of a producer for us," Anderson said. "He helps us figure out how we're going to get things done. And he's a good manager of people. So his voice comes into the discussion in ways that have nothing to do with pushing a dolly."
Sometimes the simplest-seeming shots are also the most difficult to create. For a carousel scene in "The Grand Budapest Hotel," using a real ride wouldn't match Anderson's slightly surreal concept. Instead, they built a circular track with a pie-shaped platform atop it, and more track atop that. It was capped by a skateboard-style dolly, for the carousel horse. Once it rolled into the frame and the actress Saoirse Ronan hopped on, two off-camera grips clamped it down. "And then we start pushing the whole pie-shaped wooden piece on the circular track," Sami said. The moment lasts barely 40 seconds, but it "always stands out to me, because it was the beginning of some of the more complex things that we started doing."

Beyond the dense, staccato paragraphs and action Anderson's scripts require of the big stars, a battalion of extras -- not always trained actors; he likes to hire locals on location -- must nail every tiny detail, like smoothing a mustache or blowing a smoke ring, at the exact right moment, in the right sequence, to cue each other and the camera. There are verbal, visual and motion cues, all marks to hit with strict precision. "Two inches is a mile to Wes," Sami said. "He'll notice if you're off by three millimeters." (Sami uses lasers to guide his positioning.)
And they don't just run these scenes a handful of times. "Sometimes, by the time everyone's got their part of the choreography together, we're on Take 25 or 27," he said. "And when you start getting into those numbers, if the actors all get it right and you get it wrong, no one's going to remember anything except the fact that you blew that good take."
Anderson swore he didn't intentionally challenge his grip to new heights with every project; it just happens. "But I do like to feel free to do whatever we might picture, and to know that Sanjay will find a way," he said. On a forthcoming Netflix short, "The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar," based on a Roald Dahl tale, Sami literally sent the camera soaring. "He built a track going up into the sky at an angle," Anderson said. It leans like a ladder in midair, "and the camera is on another track with a jib arm and a dolly attached to the top of the jib."
For Sami, all the sweat, effort and dizzy spells are worth it when he sees the finished product onscreen. "I've done more than 80 feature films, and the ones I'm most proud of are the ones that we do with Wes," he said, "because it's just work that, for me, from a grip point of view, doesn't exist outside of this world."

The Stars Are Shooting Again on the Tiber: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Past the monumental entrance of Rome's Cinecittà Studios, enormous screens tower over what is normally the movie studio's front lawn, enclosing a sizable -- and off-limits -- backlot for the filmmaker Luca Guadagnino's "Queer," starring Daniel Craig.
Studio 5, a stage beloved by Federico Fellini, has been reconfigured into a series of medieval rooms and courtyards for a Netflix adaptation of Boccaccio's "Decameron." Not far away, the British director Joe Wright has commandeered five studios for the eight-episode series "M: Son of the Century," based on Antonio Scurati's best-selling novel about Benito Mussolini's early years.
And, on a recent morning, crew workers scampered up scaffolding to tighten bolts and run cables on an enormous set, originally built for HBO's "Rome," soon to backdrop "Those About to Die," Roland Emmerich's gladiator series starring Anthony Hopkins.
After decades of alternating fortunes, Rome's fabled studios -- pronounced Chi-neh-chi-TAH -- appear to be reliving a glittering moment akin to the 1950s and 1960s, when American and British stars and directors flocked to Rome, and the grand, hotel-lined Via Veneto in the city center was a lively haunt for celebrity-hunting paparazzi. Then, Cinecittà was known as "Hollywood on the Tiber." Along with many classics of Italian neorealism and the spaghetti western genre, sword-and-sandal flicks like "Ben Hur," "Quo Vadis" and "Cleopatra" were made there, as well as "Roman Holiday" and "The Pink Panther."
In the past two years, "we've passed from 30 percent occupancy to 100 percent occupancy," said Nicola Maccanico, Cinecittà's chief executive. To clinch fresh deals, it was enough, he added, to modernize the facilities and promote its crews of highly skilled artisans, flaunt its location in one of the world's most beautiful and historic cities, and plug Italy's generous tax incentives to foreign productions.
His challenge, he said, was to keep the productions coming.
Maccanico became chief executive two years ago: a particularly fortuitous moment, coinciding with a sharp increase in demand for new content propelled by streaming services.
But he knows that to stay competitive in a niche market with contenders like Studio Babelsberg, near Berlin, or Pinewood Studios, just outside London, Cinecittà must continually invest in itself and its services. And grow.
Founded in 1937 by Mussolini to promote Italian cinema and, in part, make Fascist propaganda films, Cinecittà is introducing a major makeover using European Union pandemic recovery funds.
Four existing soundstages will be refurbished, and five more are scheduled to be built by 2026. One soundstage has already been outfitted with a gigantic high-tech LED wall that allows virtual effects to be added during production. The soundstage was occupied on a recent afternoon by a crew shooting a scene from the Mussolini series, colorful abstract patterns in pale pinks and blues dancing across the screen. During that set visit, Wright enigmatically described the aesthetic of the series as "quite outlandish" and "quite kaleidoscopic."
Maccanico said that virtual effects technology vastly expanded Cinecittà's moviemaking potential, making sustainable "narrative developments that would have been impossible before because of budgetary limitations."
Italy's 40 percent tax rebate on production costs for international films and television series has also been a strong drawing card.
In its 90-year history, the studio has had its share of lows, as well as highs. At one point, it was used mostly for Italian televisions series. (Only the set for Italy's "Big Brother," which first went on the air in 2000, is still operational.) Even through the lean times, Cinecittà maintained artisans on staff including carpenters, welders and set painters.
On a recent morning, Paolo Perugini, the foreman of Cinecittà's carpentry workshop, was fiddling with a computer connected to an industrial saw cutting dozens of identical panels that -- once painted -- would be used on a set for a kung fu film (still a hush-hush project).
His carpentry team was at work on three productions, he said, but had worked on as many as eight at once in recent years. Work had picked up considerably since the coronavirus pandemic began to wane, he said. "We never stop," he said. "Luckily."
Last year, Cinecittà signed a five-year deal with the production group Fremantle for the continual rental of six soundstages at the site. (They are now occupied by Wright's "M" and Guadagnino's "Queer.")
Maccanico said he was looking to develop similar partnerships with "independent producers, streaming services or -- why not? -- other studios," adding, "That's why growth is important, because it allows us to go in this direction."
The second phase of Maccanico's growth plan involves a deal with a state-controlled group to buy a 75-acre plot of land not far from the original studios. Development of that site will also draw on some of the 262 million euro from the European Union grant to make the studios more attractive to major productions.
That so many major productions are already in Rome has already given a boost to locals and companies that make movies. "It's been a positive driving force," Maccanico said. "The only thing we can't do is make Via Veneto take off again," he added, "because actors don't behave like they used to."

Full text: For Rocky Bucano, who fell for the music after buying a Salt-N-Pepa CD in 1986, his work in the Bronx "doesn't feel like work."
The Universal Hip Hop Museum, which will be part of Bronx Point, a new mixed-use development with affordable housing in the South Bronx, is not scheduled to open until 2025. But that hasn't stopped Rocky Bucano, the museum's executive director, from celebrating hip-hop's 50th anniversary this year.
"[R]Evolution of Hip Hop," an exhibition tracing the genre's momentum from 1986 to 1990, will offer free admission this August in honor of the anniversary. The show is running through September at the nonprofit's temporary headquarters in the Bronx Terminal Market.
Mr. Bucano, 63, lives in the Clason Point section of the Bronx with his wife, Kim, 62, who recently retired as a public-school teacher, and the younger of their two sons, Kylerr, 31. Rounding out the household are Tangy, the family's Bichon Frisé mix, and Toby, a former stray cat.
6 IN THE MORNIN' I get up around 6 or 7 a.m. and open up my Microsoft Surface Duo 2. I scroll through emails and read the Sunday edition of The Times. I do this in bed very quietly. I'm trying not to wake my wife up.
THE MESSAGE Around 8 or 10 o'clock, we normally order pancakes and scrambled eggs and maybe some corned beef hash from the Crosstown Diner. We have our breakfast watching the Sunday news. I like the political talk shows, like "This Week with George Stephanopoulos." My wife watches Channel 12, which has news on the Bronx, religiously. After that, we try to get our spiritual vibe on by watching Joel Osteen.
IN DA CLUB The exhibit at the Bronx Terminal Market opens at 1 p.m. My son Kylerr and I usually jump in the car and shoot over there. He oversees social media for the museum and is a docent. Most of the time, I'm there all afternoon. I'm meeting with people -- our visitors, our guests. Sometimes I'm working with the people who work at the museum, making sure everything is tight in terms of telling the stories of the different artifacts people are looking at. Sometimes I'll jump on the turntables if I feel like playing music.
SUPA DUPA FLY On Sundays we have a visiting D.J., Cutman LG. He's part of our team and he's always playing great music: James Brown and a lot of classic hip-hop like Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Salt-N-Pepa. When people come in, not only do they see objects about the great golden era of hip-hop, they actually feel it and experience what the music was like.
PEOPLE EVERYDAY Being here on a Sunday is work, but it doesn't feel like work. I've been a part of this project from the beginning, since we first started looking for locations in 2014. It's part of my DNA now. It's who I am. And I enjoy meeting people from different parts of the country and different parts of the world and learning what their connection to hip-hop is. Each person has a unique story about how they fell in love with it. Sometimes it's the first record they bought, sometimes it's a Run-DMC concert they went to in 1986. I remember when I bought my first Salt-N-Pepa CD. That's what got me involved in loving the music.
ROCK BOX People from Europe come over here because they're true fans of classic hip-hop and they want to relive the earliest years. On weekdays, we have teachers bringing their students. Kids come in, and many have never seen a cassette player or a vinyl. They don't know what a boom box is. We have a huge boom box, and when they see it they're like, "What is that? Why do they call it a boom box?" So it's just a lot of feel-good moments for me. I see people smiling and doing their selfies.
IT'S TRICKY When I began this journey, I wasn't really astute in what's called "the museum experience." I've been learning on the job. The first exhibit was bare-bones. The second one we fine-tuned, made it a better experience in terms of how it was curated. And now, with this third exhibit, I think we've knocked it out of the park. It's the most immersive, the most entertaining, the most informative. I would say the number one thing people like right now is the Dapper Dan Lounge, where we have a couple of his original jackets, or the D.J. booth.
PUSH IT! When I get home, I might go to the gym in our community's clubhouse and lift some weights, or sometimes I'll walk down to the water. One of the ferry stops is not too far from where we live, so I'll go down there and stand by the water and enjoy the sights. It's a way of putting everything in perspective for me.
RAPPER'S DELIGHT For dinner on Sundays we like to order turkey wings from a soul food restaurant. We'll also get collard greens, and for my son, mac and cheese. I can't eat that stuff, but I love sweet potatoes. After dinner I'm normally on my computer, emailing, sending notes to my team, looking out for anything on social media I should be paying attention to. People say I work too much.
IT WAS A GOOD DAY I might watch some film on Netflix or Amazon Prime, but I go to bed early. My wife comes to bed late because she's retired. But at 10 o'clock I say, "I'll see you later, I'm going to sleep." And that's it.

The Golfers on the PGA Tour Were Heard, Until They Weren't: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Members of America's most famous golf tour thought they had a voice. Then came a surprise pact that could reshape the sport for years to come.
The U.S. Open winner Gary Woodland had lately sensed something different in professional golf.
Players were empowered and emboldened. Executives were listening. The PGA Tour was changing. With the circuit's dominance challenged by LIV Golf, an upstart built with billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the tour felt closer to a cooperative than a dispassionate titan of professional sports.
Then came the tour's surprise announcement on June 6 that, after it had lobbied players to forsake the Saudi money it had associated with human rights abuses, the PGA Tour and the wealth fund would join forces. None of the five players who sit on the tour's board learned of the deal more than a few hours before it became public.
"It was turning toward players being heard over the last year," Woodland, who became a professional golfer in 2007, said at the Los Angeles Country Club, where the U.S. Open will conclude on Sunday. June 6, he said, showed that the voices of tour players had suddenly been "thrown out the door a little bit."
Woodland is not an outlier. In interviews and during news conferences at the Open, top players described a shaken faith in a PGA Tour they believed had recently offered them more meaningful agency and greater influence. The tour's ability to ease the restive atmosphere could influence whether the deal, which is facing significant skepticism inside the tour and in Washington, advances in the coming months.
Compared to other prominent professional sports leagues in the United States, the PGA Tour, a tax-exempt nonprofit, has an unusual structure.
Unlike in, say, the N.B.A. or the N.F.L., there are no team owners, and there is no labor union. Instead, players are independent contractors who earn eligibility for PGA Tour membership. Tour members do not generally have financial guarantees -- they may, however, earn money through assorted sponsorships -- but receive tour paychecks tied to their on-course performances. (When Viktor Hovland won the Memorial Tournament this month, he earned $ 3.6 million of the event's $ 20 million prize fund. Golfers who did not play well enough to secure places in the final two rounds collected nothing.)
In return for access to tour events and purses, players allow the circuit to negotiate television rights deals on their behalf, among other conditions. Even without a labor union, players theoretically have a say in tour operations: The 11-member board includes five seats for players, and there is a 16-player council that "advises and consults" with board members and the tour's commissioner, Jay Monahan.
But when tour leaders negotiated a framework agreement to reshape the sport in the most consequential ways since the modern tour's founding in the 1960s, players were not in the room. Rory McIlroy, the world's third-ranked golfer and a member of the tour's board, learned of the deal a week after it was signed behind closed doors at a Four Seasons hotel in San Francisco.
Deepening the turmoil, the tentative deal makes little about the future clear, mostly because lawyers and executives are still haggling over the fine print that stands to determine much about how the sport will be organized, funded and operated.
"I think the general feeling is that a lot of people feel a bit of betrayal from management," said Jon Rahm, the winner of this year's Masters Tournament.
"It's just not easy as a player that's been involved, like many others, to wake up one day and see this bombshell," he added. "That's why we're all in a bit of a state of limbo because we don't know what's going on and how much is finalized and how much they can talk about, either."
The sense of duplicity, some players suggested, might not be so severe had they not grown confident in the notion that they were increasingly central to developing the tour's path for the years ahead.
As Tiger Woods receded from golf's spotlight, Woodland observed, players found their sport searching for figures to help set its tone and direction.
"When I first started, you just went out and played and who knows what was going on," said Woodland, who remains close to Woods. "It was pretty much everyone jumped on Tiger's coattails and we just went." More recently, Woodland said, "guys are starting to get a little more of their own voice, and you're starting to see different opinions."
Faced with the rise of LIV Golf, players had helped devise changes to the tour's format and schedule. During a private meeting in Delaware last summer they tried to hash out adjustments that could help curb an exodus to LIV. Afterward, Monahan declared that the Delaware meeting "represents a remarkable moment for the PGA Tour and showcases the essence of what being a membership organization is all about."
By the middle of last month, though, Monahan was in Venice for secret talks with Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of the Saudi wealth fund. Two board members, neither of them players, were on the trip to Italy. The men later gathered in San Francisco over Memorial Day to finish up the framework deal. Afterward, the circle of people who knew about the planned partnership expanded, but did not include any players until June 6, when tour and Saudi officials announced the pact. Some players learned about it on Twitter.
The mood inside the tour only worsened as it became apparent that the deal had been constructed in extraordinary secrecy, with players' representatives on the board shut out of the talks.
"We were given the impression that we were being heard," said Joel Dahmen, a professional player since 2010 whose public profile soared this year when he appeared in the Netflix documentary series "Full Swing."
Dahmen, a self-described "midlevel" guy, said he recognized that voices like his would receive only so much priority in the tour's strategic deliberations. But many golfers were flabbergasted that even its greatest headliners were kept away from the negotiations, even as some of their colleagues said they understood that it was impractical to expect tour officials to confer with the entire membership in advance.
"If you have to consult every player, then probably nothing's ever going to happen, and that's the balance for any organization," said Adam Scott, the 2013 Masters winner and former world No. 1 player who chairs the tour's Player Advisory Council. "It's like the golf club at home: They've got the members' committee, and a few on that committee get to influence decisions."
"It's a player-centric tour," Scott added, "but it depends where you're sitting and how you look at things."
PGA Tour officials have rushed to quell the outrage, mindful that frustrations with the organization helped prepare the ground for LIV to entice players away from what is America's flagship men's golf circuit. Senior executives have been at the U.S. Open, and Monahan, who began a leave of absence this past week after what the tour described only as "a medical situation," held a contentious meeting with players hours after the deal's announcement.
Players with some of the closest ties to Monahan and other executives said they had received a barrage of feedback unlike any they recalled. Webb Simpson, a board member who won the 2012 U.S. Open, said, perhaps with a dose of hyperbole, that he had probably heard more from players since June 6 than he had in his 15 years as a tour golfer.
"We want to have unity, but we also want to trust our leaders," said Simpson, who added that he had been calling players to hear out their misgivings and aggravations. "I think as a whole they are struggling with these decisions."
Although McIlroy has signaled his support for the deal, other players with board seats have been publicly noncommittal.
"I told myself I'm not going to be for it or against it until I know everything, and I still don't know everything," Simpson said.
He sounded much like Patrick Cantlay, another board member, who said that "it seems like it's still too early to have enough information to have a good handle on the situation."
The board is scheduled to meet later this month, but it is not clear whether the pact will be ready for a vote by then. At the very least, board members are expecting a briefing that might allow them to answer more detailed questions about the tour's future.
All players can do for now, many said, is to try to imagine what the tour might look like and where they might fit into a changed ecosystem.
"Where I think I am -- and a lot of other players are -- is we're going to show up at the biggest and best events that we have tee times at, the ones that pay the most money, and we're going to go play until someone tells us we can't play in those events anymore, and then we'll go find other events," Dahmen said.
They are also settling in for a protracted period of uncertainty, grappling with the possibility that the tour could be in turmoil for another year or more. It is an unfamiliar road for many of them, after all of these years in which the tour was the unquestioned destination of choice for many of the world's top golfers, its business model familiar.
"As members or as players," Scott said, "we haven't had to deal with anything like this before."

Treasures Among Amazon's Haul: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: As Netflix pours more of its resources into original content, Amazon Prime Video is picking up the slack, adding new movies for its subscribers each month. Its catalog has grown so impressive, in fact, that it's a bit overwhelming. Here are six of our favorites you can stream right now.
'Pariah' (2011)
Dee Rees made her feature directorial debut with this heartfelt and thoughtful story about a Brooklyn teenager (the "incandescent" Adepero Oduye) named Alike, and her attempt to come out as a lesbian -- fully aware of the resistance she will face from her controlling mother (Kim Wayans). Rees, who also wrote the screenplay, is well versed in the lives these characters live, the neighborhoods they inhabit and the lies they tell one another in order to coexist. But she also captures the seductiveness of the subcultures Alike begins to explore, and the alternative they present: the choice to live one's truth, with no apologies. (If you like coming-of-age dramas, stream "Purple Rain.")
'Arrival' (2016)
So much of contemporary science fiction is merely action in sci-fi clothing that it's refreshing to encounter a film that uses its big budget, name actors and special effects to imagine not how we would battle extraterrestrials, but how we would try to embrace and understand them. Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner star as a linguist and a mathematician who attempt to establish a common language with the inhabitants of an alien ship -- all while an impatient world and trigger-happy military clamor for answers and bend to paranoia. Our critic admired how it works in a "more idealistic hopeful key than most movies in this genre."
'The Color Purple' (1985)
Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey made their unforgettable feature film debuts (and each picked up an Oscar nomination) in Steven Spielberg's tender and sensitive adaptation of Alice Walker's novel. Goldberg stars as Celie, a poor Black woman in the rural South, forced to marry the vile man she only knows as "Mister" (played, with haunting force, by Danny Glover); Spielberg gives equal weight to the grimness of her life and her power to imagine something better. Our critic praised the picture's "momentum, warmth and staying power." (For more ensemble drama, add "Soul Food" to your queue.)
'Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am' (2019)
Timothy Greenfield-Sanders's biographical documentary was released less than two months before the Nobel- and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist's death, and it serves as a fitting tribute to her life and legacy. Drawing on interviews with not only Morrison but her famous friends and admirers (including Angela Davis, Fran Lebowitz and Oprah Winfrey), Greenfield-Sanders meticulously documents Morrison's background, influences and all but immeasurable impact on literature and culture, resulting in both a respectful obituary and a spirited celebration.
'Catherine Called Birdy' (2022)
The "Girls" creator and star Lena Dunham is about the last person you'd imagine to direct a film adaptation of a young adult novel set in 13th-century England. (Perhaps that's why she did it.) What she accomplishes is a minor miracle: a delightful film that inserts a modern comic sensibility into the past, without resorting to anachronism or satire. She gets a big assist from the star Bella Ramsey ("The Last of Us"), who brings the title character to vivid, playful life, involving us in her tribulations and frustrations, as her oft-drunken father (Andrew Scott, the "hot priest" of "Fleabag") desperately attempts to marry her off. Our critic called it a "winning," "headstrong comedy."
'Appropriate Behavior' (2015)
Desiree Akhavan writes, directs and stars in this devastatingly funny, breathtakingly candid and unexpectedly sexy comedy-drama. She's is a singular comic voice, and since she's playing a variation on herself (a bisexual Brooklynite filmmaker and daughter of immigrants), the picture boasts an offhand candor and casual approach to ethnicity, class and identity that makes it distinctive even among the indie set. Our critic praised the picture's "clever and unpredictable turns of phrase."

'Dadfluencers,' or Fathers With Followings: [Style Desk]

Full text: Fueled by the pandemic and TikTok, a market for content made by fathers has staying power. Meet the "Dadfluencers."
Like many parents in the early months of the pandemic, Dave Ogleton was struggling. His business selling nutrition products was at a standstill. He and his wife, Jackie Megraw, were stuck at home in Devon, Pa., with their five (soon to be six) children, several of whom were languishing in Zoom classes.
To blow off steam, he started recording funny videos and memes about his family life and posting them on social media under the account @fitdadceo. People seemed to like them, so he posted more, with a recurring theme of "dad jokes." ("I said to my son, 'What do you call a group of crows that stick together?' He said, 'A flock.' I said, 'No, dummy. Vel-Crow."')
"Not taking myself seriously, especially in such a serious time, was freeing," Mr. Ogleton said. His audience began growing, so he posted every day. "It was very off the cuff, but I think other dads saw it and were like, 'Oh, yeah, we're doing that stuff too.' "
Today, Mr. Ogleton, who wears fitted T-shirts and a backward baseball cap in most of his videos, has 1.1 million followers on TikTok, along with partnership deals with Disney+, Netflix, Pampers and Procter & Gamble. He also sells merchandise printed with dad-joke phrases, like "It's not a dad bod. It's a father figure" and "I used to be cool."
"I'm a full-time content creator now, and it allows me to spend a lot more time with my kids," he said. "Just being around them gives me ideas. It's a double bonus."
Turning the camera on his family life also pushed Mr. Ogleton to pitch in more around the house (which, based on his videos, looks like a very normal suburban home cluttered with kids' stuff). He hadn't realized how much work needed to be done.
"Now I understand why my wife gets frustrated and run down sometimes," he said. "As dads, many of us have a lot to learn and do at home, but I think there's been a shift."
Mr. Ogleton is part of a growing number of dad influencers -- or "dadfluencers" -- who have amassed sizable followings in the past couple of years. "Fathers have been gradually playing a bigger role in the domestic lives of their families for a while, but I think the pandemic really supercharged it," said Cameron Ajdari, a founder of Currents Management in Los Angeles, which represents many dadfluencers. "It's created a big appetite for dad content, not just from brands, but also from parents and dads all around the world. Dad influencers are making other dads feel seen in a way that wasn't happening before."
The rise of dadfluencers has also been fueled by the booming popularity of TikTok. "With Instagram, a lot of men were uncomfortable with putting up these edited, staged pictures and captions," said James Nord, a founder of Fohr, an influencer marketing firm in New York City. "But TikTok has been a great entry point for a lot of dad influencers, because it comes across like you're documenting your life in a natural way, and you don't have to put yourself out there as much."
Advertisers are taking note. "Dad influencers are a kind of Trojan horse for brands," Mr. Nord said. "They are speaking to an audience that might not traditionally think of themselves as looking to other men on the internet for, say, fashion advice. But other dads are an easy entry point. And all of a sudden, here's someone people trust and relate to, talking about new pants that they love. People might not even realize that they're being influenced by this. They weren't coming to that person for style advice, but that's what they're getting."
Another reason that dads are curious to see how other dads parent is that they're in largely uncharted territory, compared with previous generations. In 2016, dads in the United States reported spending an average of eight hours a week on child care -- about triple the time that dads contributed in 1965, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.
Dads also said they spent about 10 hours a week on household chores in 2016, an increase from four hours in 1965. (Alas, while dads are doing more, a major gender gap persists: Mothers spent about 14 hours a week on child care and 18 hours a week on housework in 2016.)
The pandemic was brutal for parents in general (particularly moms, data shows), but dads were less likely to have the support systems that women are socialized to cultivate in times of hardship (also known as the "tend and befriend" response to stress).
"Traditionally, dads haven't really talked about parenting. My friends and I certainly didn't," said Thomas Piccirilli, a web developer and father of two in Monmouthshire, Wales, who posts under the Instagram account @the.dad.vibes, which has about 250,000 followers. "I think a big reason that what I was doing resonated was that I was honest and genuine about what I was experiencing."
When Kevin Laferriere and Evan Kyle Berger, comedians turned stay-at-home dads in Los Angeles, started posting skits about parenting to their shared account on TikTok, @thedumbdads, in 2021, they were also surprised by how much dads responded. "Our goal was mostly to have fun and to use it as a creative outlet," Mr. Laferriere said. "Then we heard from dads who said heartfelt things like, 'I'm the only stay-at-home dad I know, and your content helped me feel seen."'
Unlike some dadfluencers who lean into tired tropes of fatherhood -- dads are hapless morons who can't do anything, while moms are exasperated, overbearing multitaskers -- Mr. Laferriere and Mr. Berger are intentional about focusing on the universal fact that parenting is hard, regardless of who is doing it. "You're going to make mistakes. That's where the 'dumb dad' aspect comes in," Mr. Berger said. "But we're not about the weaponized incompetence that you see in a lot of dad content."
They both recalled a cleaning product commercial from their childhoods that depicted a mom coming home from work, clearly tired, to find her husband scaling a fish in the kitchen, proudly claiming that he had "dinner handled" as fish guts flew everywhere.
"Like, really? What picture are we painting of what a father is supposed to be? We don't do those types of jokes," Mr. Laferriere said. "We get enough material from being involved parents who make mistakes like everyone else. It's healthy for us to talk openly about this stuff. Screwing up, looking stupid. It's relatable."
Also relatable, albeit more fraught, is dads complaining.
"There's a lot of dads out there who are probably like, 'I'm supposed to be able to handle this without complaining or without needing support,"' said Mike Julianelle, a content marketing manager and father of two in Brooklyn who posts about parenting under the accounts @dadandburied and @gottoddlered. "But I'm very much pro-complaining, and I do it constantly, publicly, all the time."
He gets pushback for this. "I hear things like, 'If you're going to complain about your kids, you shouldn't have them.' But I think that's total nonsense. Everyone deserves to get things off their chest," he said. And finding solidarity is a nice perk. "I hear from dads, and moms too, telling me that I make them feel better."
Mr. Julianelle isn't the only one who has been surprised by the community that has grown out of his social media presence. Aaron Martin, a journalist turned stay-at-home dad in Miami, said that he never expected to make friends when he started posting Instagram videos of himself with his daughter under the account @stayathomedad. "But the more I started poking around when my daughter was napping or at night, I noticed a lot of other dads who were in similar positions, and ended up exchanging messages with some of them," he said.
Since then, he has connected with more of his dad followers, and they've even gotten together in person with their kids. "At first, I didn't know any other stay-at-home dads. And growing up in the late '80s and early '90s, I didn't really have any models for it, either. So it was isolating," he said. "The moms had their group texts, and I felt a little excluded at times." Now that he has built a network, he feels more confident as a parent, and he hopes to be an example for other dads too.
The world of dadfluencers is still relatively small, compared with many other influencer categories. But it includes a range of demographics. There are Christian dads (like Adam Busby, @adambuzz, with 1.3 million followers on Instagram), the "girl dad" (Joel Conder, a.k.a. @DadVGirls, with 1.4 million subscribers on YouTube), the "boy dad" (Devale Ellis, @iamdevale, with 2.1 million followers on Instagram), the gay dads (Jeffrey Romney Wright and Bryce Abplanalp of @growingupwithdads, with 21,000 followers on Instagram) and the cheerleader dad (Roland Pollard, of @rolandpollard, with seven million followers on TikTok). There are single dads, nonbinary dads, dads of children with special needs, dads with blended families and dads of quintuplets.
Of course, sharing your family life online comes with risks. Jonathan Joly, an influencer who started out on YouTube more than 14 years ago and now has 3.4 million followers on TikTok, weathered a backlash when he shared that one of his children is trans.
"When we learned our daughter was trans, we talked a lot about whether we could hide this from the world," he said. "But it would be really hard, and what does that tell our child?" Ultimately, he and his wife, Anna Saccone, decided to post about their daughter's transition.
"The things people call me, the things people say about me just because I've been supportive -- it's brutal," Mr. Joly said. But on the upside, he added, "so many parents say to me that I've opened their eyes to things that they wouldn't have known or accepted before."
In some ways, dadfluencers are reminiscent of the early mom bloggers of the aughts; they're speaking honestly about the trials of parenting in a public forum, and being met with a mix of judgment, eye rolling, empathy, curiosity and a kind of relief.
"I don't want to be like, 'Hi, I'm a dad and I'm so amazing. I get up at 5 o'clock in the morning and have a green juice,"' Mr. Joly said. "I stay up late every night, because it's the only time that I get to be on my own, and I need time on my own. I like content where it's about what other people do, but it shows the vulnerabilities of their parenting. And that's what I'm trying to do, too."

Under Scrutiny, An R-Rated Genre Shifts on the Fly: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: This summer, raunchy comedies with a feminist perspective are trying to reinvent an R-rated genre that often can't withstand much scrutiny.
Critics and audiences have long despaired: Where have all the romantic comedies gone? The freewheeling effervescence of bygone Harrys and Sallys and Bridget Joneses; the bright aspirational gloss of a Nancy Meyers production (her latest was dropped by Netflix in March when its price tag reportedly sailed past the $ 130 million mark).
Instead, what modern viewers mostly get are pale, labored imitations -- the frenetic Jennifer Lopez-Josh Duhamel caper "Shotgun Wedding," the hollow-core Ana de Armas-Chris Evans vehicle "Ghosted." In projects like these, romance is an empty gesture; chemistry, a distant dream. ("Your Place or Mine," a dry kiss of long-distance courtship released earlier this year, literally couldn't stand to keep Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher in the same frame physically for more than three scenes.)
Moviegoers starved for something unabashedly adult and, the film gods willing, actually fun, will probably have better luck finding it this summer in the revival of another languishing genre: the rom-com's hornier cousin, the sex comedy. Though what hard-R shenanigans look like in 2023 -- post-#MeToo, post-pandemic, mid-online culture wars -- may necessarily be a very different thing than in 1993, or even 2013.
In a landscape so dominated by bloated blockbusters and soul-deadening sequels, it's slightly depressing to acknowledge that fresh perspective can be signaled by something as simple, and as radical, as letting the lens be female. Still, there's novelty in seeing the Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence sign on to a libidinous goof like "No Hard Feelings," due June 23. She stars as a financially strapped Uber driver who agrees, for a fee, to seduce the awkward teenage son of a wealthy New York couple. The red-band trailer surpassed 45 million views in its first 24 hours online -- a testament, perhaps, to moviegoers' too-long-untapped appetite for cheerfully slapstick set pieces and "Can I touch your wiener?" jokes.
The similarly debauched "Joy Ride," a sort of sunny "Hangover" redux starring and created by Asian American women, earned near-universal raves when it premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival in March. (It's scheduled for wide release July 7.) Over 95 flamboyantly unhinged minutes, Ashley Park of "Emily in Paris" and the "Everything Everywhere All at Once" star Stephanie Hsu lead a loose foursome to China on a journey of friendship and self-discovery, breaking several dozen statutes for class-A drugs and public indecency along the way.
Introduced that same week at SXSW, the scrappy lower-budget "Bottoms" (in theaters Aug. 25) was hailed as a queer Gen-Z twist on the classic high school virginity tale. Directed by Emma Seligman ("Shiva Baby"), the movie features "Shiva" star Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri from "The Bear" as teenage lesbians who start a fight club to woo the cheerleaders of their dreams. Hickeys and hematomas ensue.
The sex they're all putting onscreen is screwball and messy and sometimes medically unsound. It also unapologetically centers female desire and pleasure of all kinks and stripes -- "I'll have what she's having" to the nth degree. If these films succeed, they'll join a short list of equal-opportunity raunch at the multiplex: Women-behaving-badly touchstones like 2011's scatological lodestar "Bridesmaids," the 2015 Amy Schumer hit "Trainwreck," and the raucous 2017 ensemble "Girls Trip," which turned Tiffany Haddish into a grapefruit-fellating meme overnight. (Think of "Easy A" (2010), starring a scarlet-lettered Emma Stone, as the PG-13 starter kit.) Those all had male and often middle-aged directors, though; far less common still are ones actually overseen by women, like Kay Cannon's "Blockers" and Olivia Wilde's "Booksmart."
So some of the demographic shifts here seem worth singling out: "Joy Ride" is the directing debut of the Malaysian American screenwriter Adele Lim, who co-wrote "Crazy Rich Asians," and the screenplay is by "Family Guy" alumnae Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and Teresa Hsiao. Most of the players on both sides of the camera in "Bottoms" -- which toggles breezily between references to bell hooks and mid-aughts Avril Lavigne -- were born after the Clinton administration.
But audiences, of course, hardly measure their leisure time in diversity bona fides. Battered by Covid, spooked by a teetering economy, and finally cooling, perhaps, on endless Marvel tentpoles, their one directive seems to be: Entertain me. Given the option of heady but esoteric award bait like "Tár" and "Women Talking," in which, respectively, a classical-music conductor spirals into self-imposed ignominy and Mennonite women debate rape in a barn, they've flocked instead to blithely ludicrous undercards like "M3gan" and "Cocaine Bear." (The latter shares two of its three producers with "Bottoms.")
Even wiener jokes, though, are freighted with the weight of history. Seth Rogen, whose career took root in the animal house that Judd Apatow built and who is credited as a producer on "Joy Ride," has acknowledged in numerous interviews that much of his catalog doesn't hold up to scrutiny today. A cursory rewatch of canon classics like "Porky's," "American Pie" and most films in the Apatow extended universe ("Knocked Up," "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," "Superbad") calls back moments of winky misogyny, casual racism and not-so-latent homophobia that seem like obvious third rails now.
How Hollywood can adapt in an era so strenuously aware of identity and isms -- and a generation of young people reportedly having significantly less sex than their predecessors -- feels like a continuing social experiment, as murky as the future of movies themselves. The gift of the most outrageous comedies, after all, is that they allow us, for an hour or two in a darkened room, to leave best behavior and safe spaces at the door. At a press preview in April, the co-stars Sydney Sweeney and Glenn Powell proudly sold their forthcoming "Anyone but You," a modern riff on Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing" due in December from the "Easy A" director Will Gluck, as a combative romance between "a real nightmare" and an ass, with no small amount of nudity. The internet swooned.
Those who fit a certain archetype, though, like Powell and Sweeney, will naturally be given more latitude than others to nudge the boundaries of mainstream taste. Projects that showcase more traditionally underrepresented groups -- or anyone, really, who falls within the confines of not straight, not skinny, not white -- are still often made to carry the full weight of representation. See the performative hand-wringing over the box office failure last year of "Bros," a well-reviewed gay rom-com with an R rating and an out cast, after it was breathlessly touted as the first film of its kind to receive wide theatrical release.
Maybe for all those reasons, there are no teachable moments explicitly embedded in the delirious, rampaging teendom of "Bottoms," even as certain life lessons sneak in sideways from the margins. Or in "Joy Ride," which nevertheless features one major character in search of her Chinese birth parents, another who is nonbinary, and two more who treat sex like a kind of globe-trotting all-you-can-eat buffet. Here, the medium is the message; the rest is as nasty -- and ultimately chaotic, tenderhearted, and yes, joyful -- as it wants to be.

Being Ex-Governor and Ex-Ally Of Trump Has Profited Christie: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Christie left the governor's office in New Jersey and set out to, as he put it, "make money." He successfully traded on his political profile -- and on his ties to the man he now wants to defeat.
As his second term as governor of New Jersey drew to a close in 2017, Chris Christie was characteristically blunt about his plans.
"I want to have fun, and I want to make money," he told The New York Times in an interview.
Mr. Christie wasted no time. On his first day out of office, he saw Bruce Springsteen on Broadway. On his second, he met with executives of DraftKings, a fantasy sports behemoth that stood to benefit enormously from the Christie administration's support for legalizing sports betting. The company later put the former governor on retainer to advise and influence state officials.
Over the past six years, Mr. Christie has repeatedly capitalized, for personal gain, on the connections he made as one of the best-known governors in the country.
He started a federal lobbying and consulting firm called Christie 55 Solutions, joined a multimillion-dollar real estate venture with a donor, landed a contract with ABC News, represented an international fugitive and sat on corporate boards, including that of his beloved New York Mets, the tortured baseball franchise run by his friend and megadonor, the billionaire Steve Cohen.
And in 2018, the Christies bought a multimillion-dollar shorefront home in Bay Head, one of the more exclusive towns on the Jersey Shore. Their neighbors included, at one point, members of Bon Jovi.
The business of being Chris Christie has received only sporadic attention since he left public office. But his latest enterprise -- a presidential campaign bent on taking down former President Donald J. Trump, a man he once endorsed and advised -- has cast a new light on his success.
A close review of corporate and government records as well as interviews with more than 30 people familiar with his lobbying and consulting work shows Mr. Christie has profited from his relationship to the man he now wants to defeat, as well as from the political profile he gained in eight years as New Jersey's governor.
Mr. Christie has made millions from interests wanting to leverage his political ties, including pharmaceutical, medical and sports betting companies, like DraftKings -- whose hiring of Mr. Christie has not been previously reported. Some had business with the state when Mr. Christie was governor, and saw him as a reliable advocate for their bottom line, while others were interested in tapping into his close association with Mr. Trump and the Trump administration.
Christie 55 Solutions earned roughly $ 1.3 million in federal lobbying fees from April 2020 to April 2021, according to federal records. The firm also earned more than $ 800,000 in consulting fees from Pacira Biosciences, a pharmaceutical company with a significant presence in New Jersey. And he has earned around $ 400,000 a year for his work as a contributor to ABC News, according to a person familiar with the contract.
Before he signed with ABC, multiple networks were interested in and were competing for Mr. Christie, another person familiar with the contract said. ABC later suspended its relationship with Mr. Christie before he began his campaign.
The total value of Mr. Christie's financial ventures is difficult to tabulate; much of his work involves corporate consulting, contracts that are not generally made public. Mr. Christie, who announced his bid in early June, has not yet been required to file a personal financial disclosure, a requirement for all federal candidates.
Mr. Christie's campaign declined both to comment on his finances and to disclose his post-governor clients and contracts.
Former public officials from both parties regularly turn to political donors and corporate allies to make money. Former President Barack Obama earned $ 400,000 in a single speech from a Wall Street firm months after leaving office and later signed a production deal with Netflix, whose founder, Reed Hastings, is a major Democratic donor.
No modern president comes close to Mr. Trump's voluminous record of conflicts of interest, allegations of self-dealing and post-presidential deal-making that marked the Trump administration and its afterlife. His entanglements have spawned continued interest on the part of ethics experts, watchdog groups and federal prosecutors, who have issued subpoenas for information about his business dealings in foreign countries during his time in the White House.
"The grift from this family is breathtaking," Mr. Christie said at a recent town hall on CNN.
While Mr. Christie's own business ties don't match Mr. Trump's, they may test how far one more norm has been eroded in the Trump era: Registering as a lobbyist -- a card-carrying member of the so-called swamp -- has long been viewed as tantamount to retiring from electoral politics.
Ambitious politicians typically tried to put distance between the "public office and the private interests they're serving," said Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan watchdog group.
"But if he's got all of these other adjacent interests," Ms. Canter said of Mr. Christie, "how impartial can you be?"
'The George Washington of legalized gaming'
Retaining Mr. Christie was a natural move for DraftKings. As governor, he had been a leading force in the push to overturn the federal law that barred sports betting in most states. In 2018, when the Supreme Court decision in the case initially known as Christie vs. National Collegiate Athletic Association allowed states to legalize sports gambling, the industry rushed to push laws in states that would allow them to cash in on a new market.
Weeks after the court's ruling, Mr. Christie was the keynote speaker at a conference a gambling industry group hosted for state legislators in New Orleans, where he criticized sports leagues that had opposed expanding gambling.
At the time, Mr. Christie was a consultant for Scientific Games, a lottery company that was part of a consortium that had won big when he privatized the New Jersey state lottery operations in 2013.
The company was now seeking Mr. Christie's advice on expanding into sports betting. Mr. Christie was paid more than $ 30,000 a month by Scientific Games, according to a person with knowledge of the arrangement who requested anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the contract.
DraftKings also put Mr. Christie on a monthly retainer and then sent him to speak to state legislators, although he did not register as a state lobbyist.
Mr. Christie initially had broad appeal. His blue-state Republicanism made him popular with moderate lawmakers in the Northeast and Midwest, and his ties to then-President Trump gave him credibility with more right-wing legislators.
"Having the George Washington of legalized gaming in the U.S. was obviously something we thought would be helpful," said Jeremy Kudon, who worked for DraftKings and a rival, FanDuel, on joint lobbying efforts at the time and now runs a gambling industry trade association. "And his relationship with Trump we thought would be helpful."
But in late 2020, just as the sports gambling industry focused its lobbying efforts on conservative Southern states, Mr. Christie broke with Mr. Trump over the president's false claims of a stolen election -- and DraftKings stopped deploying him.
A spokesman for the company declined to comment.
An $ 800,000 New Jersey connection
Mr. Christie has also worked closely with -- and for -- the pharmaceutical industry, one of the biggest economic drivers in his state.
Just months after leaving office, Mr. Christie was tapped by Mr. Trump to lead the President's Commission on Opioids, giving him a prominent national post on an issue he had made a major focus of his second term as governor.
Among the industry executives the commission brought in to testify was David Stack, the chief executive of Pacira Biosciences. Mr. Stack pressed for a change in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement policies, arguing, along with some policy experts, that the programs created incentives for doctors to prescribe opioids instead of non-opioid painkillers and other treatments that are less addictive.
The commission included Mr. Stack's suggestions in its final report and in 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services changed their policies for non-opioid treatments for pain, citing the recommendation from the Christie-led commission.
The change benefited just one drug on the market at the time: Exparel, made by Pacira.
That same year in 2018, Pacira paid $ 481,000 to Christie 55 Solutions for consulting work. In 2019, Pacira put Mr. Christie on its board and paid his firm $ 320,000, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reports did not offer any further details, and the company did not respond to questions about the payments.
As of June 2022, Mr. Christie owned 3,486 Pacira Biosciences shares worth $ 207,034.
Mr. Christie has said he was not employed by Pacira while serving on the opioids commission.
Sara Marino, a spokeswoman for the company, said Mr. Christie "provided Pacira with valuable insight and guidance" as it sought "to provide an opioid alternative to as many patients as appropriate."
Mr. Christie has continued to consult for drug companies. In April, he joined the advisory board for Cytogel Pharma, a company testing a new non-opioid pain reliever in clinical trials.
Dean Maglaris, the chief executive of Cytogel, said Mr. Christie had helped connect the young company with industry experts and government officials.
"Being from New Jersey, which is the, probably the state with the largest population of pharmaceutical companies, he has put us in contact with people that he knows," Mr. Maglaris said. Mr. Christie also helped connect the company with "folks in the federal government who have an abiding interest in solving the addiction crisis."
Negotiating with Justice
Mr. Christie, a former federal prosecutor, also got involved in a high-profile money-laundering case. Mr. Christie was hired by Jho Low, a Malaysian businessman who had been indicted in 2018 on money laundering and bribery charges and was living as a fugitive. At the time, the U.S. government had seized hundreds of millions of dollars in assets tied to Mr. Low and associates.
Mr. Christie never registered in court as an attorney for Mr. Low, but he worked behind the scenes to negotiate a deal with Justice Department lawyers. Mr. Low ultimately forfeited nearly all of the seized assets -- with the exception of $ 15 million in payments to Mr. Christie and two law firms.
The payout raised eyebrows among other lawyers involved. They saw it as a hefty sum for the legal work performed, but ultimately the Justice Department agreed to it, because the priority was to make sure Mr. Low did not have access to the money himself, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations.
Although Mr. Christie had been using his connections in the Trump administration as a consultant for years, he did not register as a federal lobbyist until June 2020, shortly after the pandemic hit.
As Congress passed several bills to help both businesses and health care providers, several major health care networks, all in New Jersey, hired Christie 55 Solutions: Atlantic Health System, RWJBarnabas Health and Hackensack Meridian Health each paid the firm $ 200,000 for a little less than a year's work.
Christie 55 Solutions, whose small staff included Mr. Christie's wife, Mary Pat Christie, and Rich Bagger, his former chief of staff, closed its federal lobbying shop in late 2021.
Seeing opportunity at home
As he used his sway in Washington, Mr. Christie kept one foot in New Jersey. Both Mr. and Mrs. Christie joined a real estate venture with a New Jersey developer, Jon Hanson, a longtime political ally and fund-raiser for Mr. Christie's campaigns.
Mr. Christie's involvement was announced in 2019 as the enterprise, named the Hampshire Christie Qualified Opportunity Fund, set out to find investors for real estate developments taking advantage of federal "opportunity zones," a Republican-backed tax program intended to benefit low-income neighborhoods. The Trump administration program has been criticized as a windfall for wealthy developers.
The Christies are "investor partners" in the fund and Mrs. Christie has helped raise some of the money, Mr. Hanson told The Times.
Karl Rickett, a spokesman for the Christie campaign, said the former governor was never involved in the fund as a senior adviser or in any other capacity, and that the venture was entirely a project of Mrs. Christie's.
The fund has raised $ 80 million of its $ 250 million goal for three luxury housing and retail projects in Hackensack, N.J., and a New London, Conn., storage facility that will be developed by the firm Mr. Hanson founded, according to Mr. Hanson.
When the fund was first publicized, Mrs. Christie promoted her husband's involvement as an advantage, saying he would use his connections to smooth the path with New Jersey mayors, town councils and zoning boards.
"Nobody really knows New Jersey as well as Chris, because he's been at the helm for the last eight years," she said to The Wall Street Journal at the time.
Mr. Hanson, however, has said that has not happened. Mr. Christie has not been involved at the local level, he said.

In 2018, when the Supreme Court decision in the case initially known as Christie vs. National Collegiate Athletic Association allowed states to legalize sports gambling, the industry rushed to push laws in states that would allow them to cash in on a new market.
Weeks after the court’s ruling, Christie was the keynote speaker at a conference a gambling industry group hosted for state legislators in New Orleans, where he criticized sports leagues that had opposed expanding gambling.
At the time, Christie was a consultant for Scientific Games, a lottery company that was part of a consortium that had won big when he privatized the New Jersey state lottery operations in 2013.
The company was now seeking Christie’s advice on expanding into sports betting. Christie was paid more than $30,000 a month by Scientific Games, according to a person with knowledge of the arrangement who requested anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the contract.
DraftKings also put Christie on a monthly retainer and then sent him to speak to state legislators, although he did not register as a state lobbyist.
Christie initially had broad appeal. His blue-state Republicanism made him popular with moderate lawmakers in the Northeast and Midwest, and his ties to then-President Trump gave him credibility with more right-wing legislators.
“Having the George Washington of legalized gaming in the U.S. was obviously something we thought would be helpful,” said Jeremy Kudon, who worked for DraftKings and a rival, FanDuel, on joint lobbying efforts at the time and now runs a gambling industry trade association. “And his relationship with Trump we thought would be helpful.”
But in late 2020, just as the sports gambling industry focused its lobbying efforts on conservative Southern states, Christie broke with Trump over the president’s false claims of a stolen election — and DraftKings stopped deploying him.
A spokesperson for the company declined to comment.
An $800,000 New Jersey connection
Christie has also worked closely with — and for — the pharmaceutical industry, one of the biggest economic drivers in his state.
Just months after leaving office, Christie was tapped by Trump to lead the President’s Commission on Opioids, giving him a prominent national post on an issue he had made a major focus of his second term as governor.
Among the industry executives the commission brought in to testify was David Stack, the chief executive of Pacira Biosciences. Stack pressed for a change in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement policies, arguing, along with some policy experts, that the programs created incentives for doctors to prescribe opioids instead of non-opioid painkillers and other treatments that are less addictive.
The commission included Stack’s suggestions in its final report and in 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services changed their policies for non-opioid treatments for pain, citing the recommendation from the Christie-led commission.
The change benefited just one drug on the market at the time: Exparel, made by Pacira.
That same year in 2018, Pacira paid $481,000 to Christie 55 Solutions for consulting work. In 2019, Pacira put Christie on its board and paid his firm $320,000, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reports did not offer any further details, and the company did not respond to questions about the payments.
As of June 2022, Christie owned 3,486 Pacira Biosciences shares worth $207,034.
Christie has said he was not employed by Pacira while serving on the opioids commission.
Sara Marino, a spokesperson for the company, said Christie “provided Pacira with valuable insight and guidance” as it sought “to provide an opioid alternative to as many patients as appropriate.”
Christie has continued to consult for drug companies. In April, he joined the advisory board for Cytogel Pharma, a company testing a new non-opioid pain reliever in clinical trials.
Dean Maglaris, the chief executive of Cytogel, said Christie had helped connect the young company with industry experts and government officials.
“Being from New Jersey, which is the, probably the state with the largest population of pharmaceutical companies, he has put us in contact with people that he knows,” Maglaris said. Christie also helped connect the company with “folks in the federal government who have an abiding interest in solving the addiction crisis.”
Negotiating with Justice
Christie, a former federal prosecutor, also got involved in a high-profile money-laundering case. Christie was hired by Jho Low, a Malaysian businessman who had been indicted in 2018 on money laundering and bribery charges and was living as a fugitive. At the time, the U.S. government had seized hundreds of millions of dollars in assets tied to Low and associates.
Christie never registered in court as an attorney for Low, but he worked behind the scenes to negotiate a deal with Justice Department lawyers. Low ultimately forfeited nearly all of the seized assets — with the exception of $15 million in payments to Christie and two law firms.
The payout raised eyebrows among other lawyers involved. They saw it as a hefty sum for the legal work performed, but ultimately the Justice Department agreed to it, because the priority was to make sure Low did not have access to the money himself, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations.
Although Christie had been using his connections in the Trump administration as a consultant for years, he did not register as a federal lobbyist until June 2020, shortly after the pandemic hit.
As Congress passed several bills to help both businesses and health care providers, several major health care networks, all in New Jersey, hired Christie 55 Solutions: Atlantic Health System, RWJBarnabas Health and Hackensack Meridian Health each paid the firm $200,000 for a little less than a year’s work.
Christie 55 Solutions, whose small staff included Christie’s wife, Mary Pat Christie, and Rich Bagger, his former chief of staff, closed its federal lobbying shop in late 2021.
Seeing opportunity at home
As he used his sway in Washington, Christie kept one foot in New Jersey. Both he and his wife joined a real estate venture with a New Jersey developer, Jon Hanson, a longtime political ally and fundraiser for Christie’s campaigns.
Christie’s involvement was announced in 2019 as the enterprise, named the Hampshire Christie Qualified Opportunity Fund, set out to find investors for real estate developments taking advantage of federal “opportunity zones,” a Republican-backed tax program intended to benefit low-income neighborhoods. The Trump administration program has been criticized as a windfall for wealthy developers.
The Christies are “investor partners” in the fund and Mary Pat Christie has helped raise some of the money, Hanson told the Times.
Karl Rickett, a spokesperson for the Christie campaign, said the former governor was never involved in the fund as a senior adviser or in any other capacity, and that the venture was entirely a project of Mary Pat Christie’s.
The fund has raised $80 million of its $250 million goal for three luxury housing and retail projects in Hackensack, New Jersey, and a New London, Connecticut, storage facility that will be developed by the firm Hanson founded, according to Hanson.
When the fund was first publicized, Mary Pat Christie promoted her husband’s involvement as an advantage, saying he would use his connections to smooth the path with New Jersey mayors, town councils and zoning boards.
“Nobody really knows New Jersey as well as Chris, because he’s been at the helm for the last eight years,” she said to The Wall Street Journal at the time.
Hanson, however, has said that has not happened. Chris Christie has not been involved at the local level, he said.

Comedy
Sam Jay
June 17 at 7 and 9:30 p.m. at Brooklyn Steel, 319 Frost Street, Brooklyn; bowerypresents.com.
During the 2022 Emmy Awards, some might have been surprised that the stand-up comedian Sam Jay was the telecast's official announcer. But Jay, whom Jason Zinoman called "one of the most exciting provocateurs in comedy" in The New York Times in 2020, has produced critically acclaimed work for years.
In her time as a writer for "Saturday Night Live," Jay earned three Emmy nominations. Her debut special for Netflix, "3 in the Morning," landed on several best-of lists in 2020. Both seasons of Jay's HBO variety sketch series, "Pause With Sam Jay," were nominated for Writers Guild Awards. And last year, she co-created and co-starred in the Peacock series "Bust Down."
Jay will be filming her second special, and her first for HBO, "Salute Me or Shoot Me," at Brooklyn Steel on Saturday. Tickets are $ 35 and available through AXS. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Re: SET
June 16-18 at 4 p.m. at Forest Hills Stadium, 1 Tennis Place, Queens; foresthillsstadium.com.
Even for devoted fans, music festivals can present challenges, from fatigue to overcrowding to paradox of choice. Re: SET, a multicity concert series -- essentially a small-scale touring festival -- arrives in Queens this weekend with a more streamlined alternative. Across three days, the series will present 12 acts, with each night's lineup selected by the headliner.
On Friday, the dance punks LCD Soundsystem top the bill, with the experimental artist L'Rain, the post-punk band Idles and the British beat maker Jamie xx warming up the crowd. Saturday's main draw is the indie-rock trio boygenius, making its lone stop in New York to promote its recent full-length debut. The group's chosen openers are the introspective singer-songwriter Clairo and the genre-swerving musicians Dijon and Bartees Strange. Sunday's lineup foregrounds various takes on R&B, with the unexpected star Steve Lacy headlining. Fousheé, who co-wrote Lacy's viral hit "Bad Habit," will open, along with Toro y Moi and James Blake.
Single-day tickets, which start at $ 99.50, are available at newyork.resetconcertseries.com. Saturday night is sold out, but resale options can be found. OLIVIA HORN
Anthony Braxton Theater Improvisations
June 15-17 at 8 p.m. at the Brick, 579 Metropolitan Avenue, Brooklyn; bricktheater.com.
The dramatic works of the composer and multi-instrumentalist Anthony Braxton are due for a big summer. August will see the premiere of his long-awaited opera "Trillium X" in Prague. But closer to home, you can check out interpretations of his Opuses 279 to 283, courtesy of the plucky Experiments in Opera troupe. Written for a narrator and instrumentalist, the pieces are all dedicated to stand-up comics. (Composition No. 283 honors Lenny Bruce.)
During this run, the director Rob Reese will double as an actor. And though Braxton will not be performing on these dates, the Experiments crew has invited a few soloists who are experienced in his multivalent compositional strategies. The vocalist Kamala Sankaram -- a veteran of the "Trillium" operas -- will perform with Reese on all dates. On Thursday, the trumpeter Nate Wooley will be the instrumentalist. The saxophonist James Fei will appear on Friday; Ingrid Laubrock will take her turn on sax on Saturday. Tickets are $ 30 and available on the Brick's website. SETH COLTER WALLS
Kids
'Blast Off! (to Space): The Show'
June 17, 22, 24 and 25 at the Brooklyn Children's Museum, 145 Brooklyn Avenue; brooklynkids.org.
NASA may have retired the space shuttle, but at least in the imaginations of young visitors to the Brooklyn Children's Museum, it will soon soar again.
Beginning on Saturday, Mélissa Smith, a theater artist, will turn the museum into a launching pad for her multimedia solo production, "Blast Off! (to Space): The Show." Smith, who created and performs "Blast Off!," drew her inspiration from "Mae Among the Stars," a picture book about Mae C. Jemison, a real shuttle mission specialist and the first female African American astronaut.
As well as going on a 30-minute secret mission with Smith inside the "shuttle" (an inflatable planetarium), young spectators can explore their own space fantasies at activity stations before and after the show.
Performances, which include a dance party, are at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Saturday and June 24 and 25, with a show at 3 p.m. on June 22 and an additional one at 3:30 p.m. on June 25. Tickets are included with museum admission, which starts at $ 12 and is free on Thursdays from 2 to 5 p.m. LAUREL GRAEBER
Dance
Broadway Bares
June 18 at 9:30 p.m. and midnight; Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan; broadwaycares.org.
In 1992, Jerry Mitchell and a few of his fellow Broadway dancers got on a bar in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, took off their clothes and raised $ 8,000 for the then-nascent health service organization Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. More than three decades later, that sexy seed has grown into a massive and beloved annual burlesque spectacle with almost 200 dancers. It has raised over $ 22 million to support a variety of programs assisting theater professionals in need.
The highly polished production returns on Sunday for two performances. This year's theme is "Pleasure Park," taking inspiration from the amusement park experience and featuring a dozen dance numbers in a mash-up of styles, including hip-hop, ballet, Latin dance and aerial arts. But stripping remains the key ingredient, and each short dance offers its own clever way for dancers to get nearly naked. Tickets start at $ 75 and are available on the Broadway Cares website.

Festivals
Photoville
Through June 18, noon-8 p.m., at Emily Warren Roebling Plaza in Brooklyn Bridge Park, as well as at other locations in New York City; photoville.com.
It's a great time for photography fans in New York: Richard Avedon's murals loom large in a room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and 220 of his celebrity portraits have taken over the Gagosian in Chelsea. At the same time, "New Photography 2023" at the Museum of Modern Art offers a window on life in West Africa, as captured by some of the region's best photographers. And then there's Photoville, a photography festival that has grown from an annual encampment of shipping-containers-turned-mini-galleries under the Brooklyn Bridge to a citywide celebration of visual feats shared freely with all.
One could devote an entire weekend to visiting each of Photoville's more than 80 installations -- from portraits of "Star Wars" fans at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx to hip-hop memories at South Street Seaport in Manhattan to Staten Island vistas at the Staten Island vista of South Beach Promenade. The festival's main base at Brooklyn Bridge Park takes visitors through a wide range of styles and on a roller coaster of emotions -- from the whimsy of an imagined Eden in Alison Carey's digital collages to the drama recreated in "Dear Mr. Welles" to the hopefulness captured in "Picturing Black Girlhood: Black Utopia" to the heartbreak of scenes from Mariupol, Ukraine. For more information and a map of the installations, go to Photoville's website. DANIELLE DOWLING

Battle of Ink and Ice: A Sensational Story of News Barons, North Pole Explorers, and the Making of Modern Media, by Darrell Hartman
American explorers discovered the North Pole later than you might think: It wasn't until 1909 that Admiral Robert Peary became the first person to plant a flag in the Arctic frost. Or was it Frederick Cook a year earlier? This deeply-researched new history shows what happened when the big New York newspapers of the day took sides and profited off the debate.
Viking, June 6
Pageboy: A Memoir, by Elliot Page
The star of "Juno" and the popular Netflix sci-fi series "The Umbrella Academy" came out as trans in December 2020. The before and after is the subject of his new memoir. The Oscar nominated actor's story skips across time, from scenes of bullying in his Nova Scotia childhood to later identity struggles, which became increasingly unbearable as fame set in. Post-transition life in the public eye brought some intolerance and hate, but also kindness from family, fans and colleagues, not to mention the relief of being more comfortably embodied at last.
Flatiron, June 6
The Talk, by Darrin Bell
A Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist draws on his childhood in Los Angeles to explore racism on a deeply personal level. The first time he heard "the talk," he was 6 and wanted a toy water gun, prompting his mother to gently explain the entrenched bias in how Black children are perceived. There's a poignancy, too, in the cyclical nature of the story: Bell, now a father, is wrestling with the same questions his own parents faced.

A Most Tolerant Little Town: The Explosive Beginning of School Desegregation, by Rachel Louise Martin
In 1954, Brown v. Board of Education decided that public education in America could not be segregated based on race. Two years later, Clinton High in Tennessee was the first school in the former Confederacy to attempt to follow that ruling. The historian Rachel Louise Martin interviewed dozens of Clinton residents to produce this immersive account of the riots, bombings and cross-burnings that ensued.

Wannabe: Reckonings with the Pop Culture That Shapes Me, by Aisha Harris
"Pop culture shapes us, and we shape it right back in an invigorating feedback loop of creativity and interpretation," writes Harris, a podcast host and cultural critic for NPR (and former New York Times journalist). She is keenly aware of the role that music, movies and TV have played in her life -- right down to her own name.

The Sullivanians: Sex, Psychotherapy, and the Wild Life of an American Commune, by Alexander Stille
In the late 1950s in New York City, a group of therapists founded the Sullivan Institute, which promoted free love and communal living and attracted hundreds of followers, including the painter Jackson Pollock. But within a few years, the group took on the feeling of an insular, hierarchical cult, with leaders overseeing even the most intimate details of the members' lives.

The Heat Will Kill You First: Life and Death on a Scorched Planet, by Jeff Goodell
This is an alarming, and timely, look at how rising temperatures across the globe will radically change our lives unless we make a concerted effort to scale back the use of fossil fuels. Goodell, a journalist, has covered the environment and climate change for years, warning readers about the dangers that may appear incremental now but carry profound ramifications; his 2017 book, "The Water Will Come," looked at the rising sea levels across the world, which "will reshape our world in ways most of us can only dimly imagine."
Little, Brown, July 11
The Underworld: Journeys to the Depths of the Ocean, by Susan Casey
Casey, a best-selling author who has written extensively about sea life, takes readers to one of the world's most remote reaches: the deep ocean, which has fascinated humans for centuries. It's home to otherworldly creatures and a wholly distinct ecosystem with volcanoes and mountains -- and we're only beginning to understand its complexity. Technological advances have allowed governments (and yes, some wealthy individuals) to explore these depths, and Casey makes a case for why this realm is essential to the planet's future.

The Visionaries: Arendt, Beauvoir, Rand, Weil, and the Power of Philosophy in Dark Times, by Wolfram Eilenberger
In 2020, English-speaking readers got "Time of the Magicians: Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Cassirer, Heidegger and the Decade that Reinvented Philosophy," a celebrated biography of the interwar period as seen by some of the biggest Teutons to take on the life of the mind. Now, the German writer is back with another Mount Rushmore of philosophy, translated by Shaun Whiteside. The ideological mash-up of Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir, Ayn Rand, and Simone Weil may seem oil and water, but their responses to the world around them helps Eilenberger illuminate a fateful decade -- 1933 to 1943 -- terrifying years for Europe and an eventful period for these monumental thinkers.
Penguin Press, Aug. 8
The Marriage Question: George Eliot's Double Life, by Clare Carlisle
It's no surprise that George Eliot, the great portraitist of unhappy Victorian couples, did marriage her own way. In 1854, the soon-to-be novelist traveled to Berlin for a research trip with George Lewes, the philosopher, critic and father of three. (He was already married, albeit in an open kind of way.) Lewes encouraged Eliot to write fiction and to share the next two and a half decades with him. The relationship was a scandal. In telling their story, Claire Carlisle, a professor of philosophy at King's College, draws on her study of theology, history and the 19th century's politics of desire.
Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Aug. 15
Queen of the Court: The Many Lives of Tennis Legend Alice Marble, by Madeleine Blais
A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist dives into the life and times of Marble (1913-1990), both on and off the court. Marble was one of the world's top-ranked female tennis players -- Billie Jean King called her "a picture of unrestrained athleticism" -- and used her prominence to argue for the desegregation of the sport. She also designed clothes, sang at the Waldorf Astoria and wrote books, including memoirs that put out the dubious claim that she was a spy.
Atlantic Monthly Press, Aug. 15
Daughter of the Dragon: Anna May Wong's Rendezvous with American History, by Yunte Huang
Wong was the most famous Chinese American actress of her time, known for roles in "Shanghai Express" (where she acted alongside Marlene Dietrich) and "The Toll of the Sea." Huang, an academic at the University of California, Santa Barbara, traces her life, which began as the daughter of Chinese Americans who ran a laundry in Los Angeles, the obstacles she overcame in her career and her legacy.

Necessary Trouble: Growing Up at Midcentury, by Drew Gilpin Faust
During her childhood in 1950s Virginia, Faust -- a historian and former president of Harvard -- became deeply attuned to racism and sexism, spurring a lifelong passion for civil rights. Rather than follow the path her parents would have preferred (one of a "well adjusted," poised young lady), the author engaged with the biggest social and political issues of the time. Here she reflects on how American society has evolved.
Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Aug. 22
They Called Us Exceptional: And Other Lies That Raised Us, by Prachi Gupta
Gupta, who was raised in a supportive, well-to-do Indian American family in the Pennsylvania suburbs, uses her own experience to examine the dark side of the model minority myth. "In our family, we learned to love one another for how well we were able to conform to the story they wrote for us -- not as who we really are," she writes, referring to the expectations of the white community around her.

Treat Williams, 71, Dynamic Star Of 'Hair' and 'Everwood,' Is Dead: [Biography]

Author: Genzlinger, Neil; Ives, Mike

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His many other roles included a detective turned informant in "Prince of the City." He was killed in a motorcycle accident in Vermont.
Treat Williams, who drew wide attention with distinctive performances in the film version of "Hair" in 1979 and the police drama "Prince of the City" two years later before settling into a steady career in film and television that included a four-season run on the WB series "Everwood," died on Monday in a motorcycle accident in Dorset, Vt. He was 71.
Mr. Williams was killed shortly before 5 p.m. when an S.U.V. that was southbound on Route 30 near the Vermont-New York border turned left into a parking lot and into the path of the Honda motorcycle driven by Mr. Williams, the Vermont State Police said in a statement.
Mr. Williams was "unable to avoid a collision and was thrown from his motorcycle," the statement said.
Mr. Williams, who was wearing a helmet, was pronounced dead at a medical center in Albany, N.Y., after being airlifted there, the state police said. The 35-year-old man whose vehicle hit Mr. Williams was not hospitalized.
Mr. Williams was a familiar face in the movies and on TV, accumulating some 130 credits while also occasionally working on the stage. It was a stage performance that landed him his breakout role in "Hair" -- he was a replacement player in the lead role of Danny Zuko in the long-running Broadway production of "Grease" in the 1970s, and when the film director Milos Forman saw him in that show, he invited him to take the role of the hippie Berger in his film of "Hair," based on the rock stage musical of the 1960s.
Berger was a mop-topped rebel, and Mr. Williams had some help from the makeup department in creating his portrayal.
"All that hair in 'Hair' wasn't my own," he told The New York Times in 1980. "A lot of it was woven into my own hair right at the scalp. If I moved the wrong way in my sleep, I'd pull it and make my scalp bleed."
His energetic performance impressed critics.
"As his name might indicate," Janet Maslin wrote in The Times, "Treat Williams is one of the better things 'Hair' has to offer. Mr. Williams, who plays the leader of the film's small and bedraggled band of hippies, is the only one of the players who really suggests the spirit of euphoria upon which the original 'Hair' meant to capitalize."
Mr. Williams's performance in "Hair" drew the attention of Sidney Lumet, who was preparing to direct "Prince of the City," a fictionalized version of the story of Robert Leuci, a New York City detective who exposed corruption in the police department. Mr. Lumet told Newsweek in 1981 that Mr. Williams's performance in "Hair" displayed "a life force, a kind of inner energy, bouncing off the screen." He cast him in the lead role in "Prince of the City," a demanding one.
"Williams is almost always onscreen," Roger Ebert, film critic for The Chicago Sun-Times, wrote, "and almost always in situations of extreme stress, fatigue and emotional turmoil. We see him coming apart before our eyes."
Such performances landed Mr. Williams on the cover of Newsweek in December 1981. He was pictured alongside William Hurt and Elizabeth McGovern. The headline was "A New Breed of Actor."
"Versatility is a mark of the new breed," the accompanying article said, "and Treat Williams is one of its most versatile." About the time "Prince of the City" was being released, it noted, Mr. Williams was stepping into the role of the Pirate King in "The Pirates of Penzance" on Broadway, replacing Kevin Kline, who had won a Tony Award for his portrayal.
Versatility kept Mr. Williams working steadily for the next four decades. He played doctors, law enforcement officials, various villains, assorted military officers, lovable father figures. In "Confirmation" (2016), an HBO docudrama about the Supreme Court nomination hearings of Clarence Thomas, he played Senator Edward M. Kennedy. One of his most recent movies was "Dolly Parton's Christmas on the Square," a holiday film for Netflix in which he played opposite Ms. Parton and sang a song she wrote, "Memories."
Richard Treat Williams was born Dec. 1, 1951, in Stamford, Conn. "Treat" is a Welsh name that has been in his family for generations. His father, Richard, was a World War II veteran who later worked for the Merck pharmaceutical company and elsewhere. His mother, Marian (Andrew) Williams, owned a sailing and swimming school on Long Island Sound.
Mr. Williams moved with his family to Rowayton, Conn., as a young child, he told Vermont magazine in a 2021 interview.
"Looking back on my younger years," he told the magazine, "I had an idyllic childhood, but I didn't initially realize how idyllic it truly was until I grew older."
Mr. Williams began acting in seventh grade. Later, at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, he quit the football team to focus on acting. He also performed with a group called the Actors' Company at the Fulton Opera House in Lancaster, Pa., where one of his earliest performances was in the Anthony Newley role in "Stop the World, I Want to Get Off," in March 1971, when he was a sophomore in college.
"The part is one which taxes the talents of any performer -- part mime, part actor and part singer," Sam Taylor wrote in a rave review in The Lancaster New Era. "Williams displayed all of these ingredients in full supply."
Mr. Williams graduated from Franklin and Marshall in 1973 and was soon working in New York. In 1975 he appeared in a revival of William Inge's "Bus Stop" at the Equity Library Theater in Manhattan; his first film role came that year as well, in a police drama called "Deadly Hero," as part of a cast that also included James Earl Jones.
For a brief moment after the box-office failure of a 1980 film comedy called "Why Would I Lie?" that he was in, Mr. Williams, a pilot, soured on acting and started flying planes for a company in Los Angeles.
"I wasn't working with people I wanted to work with," he told The Times in 1981. "I was very frustrated."
But then Mr. Lumet called to offer him "Prince of the City."
Among his later career highlights was "Everwood," a WB television series about a New York neurosurgeon who starts a new life with his family in the mountains of Colorado after his wife dies in a car accident. The show debuted in 2002.
More recently, Mr. Williams played a retired detective on the 2022 HBO series "We Own This City."
Information about Mr. Williams's survivors was not immediately available.
Hours before he died, Mr. Williams, who lived in Manchester Center, Vt., posted a photo on Twitter that he appeared to have taken from the seat of his lawn mower.
"Mowing today," he wrote. "Wish I could bottle the scent."

Full text: This Peacock dark comedy targets a ubiquitous guilty pleasure, but its knife is dull.
"The great American art form isn't music or film or television," says a podcast host in "Based on a True Story," a new dark comedy on Peacock. "The great American art form is murder. We watch it, we celebrate it, we obsess over it."
It is hard to argue with that one. Forget the surfeit of murder podcasts that "Based on a True Story" satirizes, however fitfully. Forget the number of true-crime murder shows that it shares streaming space with. "Based on a True Story" is not even the first TV comedy about a fictional murder podcast. (Steve Martin and Martin Short would like a word.) This pop-cultural corpse is so well worked over, it's hard to find a new place to stick the knife.
The distinction of "True Story," created by Craig Rosenberg, is that its central couple and would-be podcast moguls, Ava (Kaley Cuoco) and Nathan (Chris Messina), are not amateur sleuths who spend the eight-episode season piecing together a whodunit. They have the case of a lifetime fall into their laps, or rather into their bathroom.
An overflowing toilet brings them together with Matt (Tom Bateman), a charming, ingratiating and smoking hot plumber. (Peacock considers the next piece of information a spoiler, so beware I guess, but it's also the premise of the show and revealed in the first episode.) He is also, as a bit of sloppy evidence concealment on his part leads them to learn, the West Side Ripper, a serial killer preying on young women in their part of Los Angeles.
The natural reaction, a terrified call to the police, would make for a one-episode series. But Ava and Nathan have other incentives. Ava, a struggling real estate agent, is pregnant and fears they won't be able to support a child. Nathan, a tennis pro whose Grand Slam dreams ended with a blown-out knee, has just lost his job to a younger racket swinger at the club. In a land of money and sex, they're in a hole and in a rut.
Ava, a murder-podcast maven, sees a chance to make their own killing, by blackmailing Matt into recording a show in which he gives a first-person tour through his slasher psyche. "We are good people," she says. "We played by the rules. And look where it got us." Matt, perhaps surprisingly, agrees with enthusiasm. Less surprisingly, he turns out to be an untrustworthy partner on several points, among them his promise to lay off the stabbing.
The rhythms of the deal-with-the-devil story will feel familiar if you've watched a series or two about everyday people dabbling in the criminal arts and getting in over their heads. (Jason Bateman, of Netflix's "Ozark," is among the producers.) What's more interesting, and sadly more under-realized, is the story's setting within the American murder-entertainment complex.
There's potential for a real critique, which applies to both trashy true-crime and more high-minded investigations. We've created a culture of treating murders -- real, not just fictional ones -- as addictive, twisty, escapist obsessions.
Nor is this phenomenon limited to podcasts. Scripted TV, chasing the success of documentaries like "The Jinx," "Making a Murderer" and their many heirs, has gone on a spree of copycat crime.
After "Dahmer," Ryan Murphy is expanding his "Monster" franchise with a series on the Menendez brothers. The true-crime docu-series "The Staircase" became the true-crime scripted series "The Staircase." This spring, we got the second limited series in two years about the Candy Montgomery murder case from 1980.
Who asked for all this? Whose stories get told, and which victims get lip service in the telling? When does the impulse to understand become simply bloody voyeurism?
"Based on a True Story" could have been a sanguinary sendup of the media impulse to turn slashers into celebrities, a kind of "Sweeney Pod." But like the overwhelmed Ava and Nathan, the series has its hands on some hot material yet doesn't quite know what to do with it.
The comedy starts off gamely, with well-observed spoofs of murder media, especially in a stretch set at "CrimeCon," a convention where superstar crime-casters hawk their wares while dutifully saying that their work is all about the victims. Matt, attending incognito, takes to the marketplace with cynical zest, referring to his killings as "content."
But there's a deep darkness to the comedy that "True Story" feels skittish about really engaging with. In an irritating and overused gimmick, it repeatedly takes shocking turns that turn out to be fantasy sequences, as if the series is willing to engage with its characters' moral rot only in the form of role play.
One limitation may lie in casting Cuoco and Messina, whose comic gifts run to styles other than caustic satire. She redefined her career after "The Big Bang Theory" playing a likable basket case in "The Flight Attendant"; he excelled as a grump-next-door in "The Mindy Project." Together, they make a solid core for a quirky marriage-on-the-rocks comedy, which ultimately is what "Based on a True Story" is, to the detriment of its deadlier ambitions.
It's often amusing, on the strength of the duo's screwball charm. (Tom Bateman is harder to pin down, never really giving us a sense of what drives Matt either as criminal or entrepreneur.) But at worst, even if unintentionally, "True Story" indulges in the same thing it satirizes, the impulse to make murder fun.
Its predecessor "Only Murders in the Building" pulls this off by essentially adapting the trusty cozy-murder format within a twee, New Yorker-cartoon version of reality. What "True Story" is working with -- the vicious, sensationalized, sexually freighted murders of a string of young women -- is a bigger risk, and its downplaying of the killings' heinousness feels that much ickier.
The great cliché of serial-killer stories is the seemingly harmless neighbor with skeletons in the closet (or garage, or freezer). "Based on a True Story" is the opposite, a seemingly daring, dark premise that disguises a mild domestic comedy. It promises slashing satire. It cuts like a butter knife.

Re "Universities, Meet Monasteries," by Molly Worthen (Opinion guest essay, May 28):
Dr. Worthen's essay resonated deeply with me. I am a tutor and the incoming dean of St. John's College, Santa Fe, one of the oldest colleges in America, a college with an enduring commitment to seminar-style discussion and the close reading of the Great Books.
Without fanfare, year after year, St. John's continues to offer a program of study that requires little more than a great book, a seminar table and the participants around that table.
St. John's is not a monastery, but it does provide a cloister where devices and the pull of the virtual world have no place. The education requires the students to be present to their thoughts, to the comments of their classmates, to the beauty of the texts. In doing so they experience self-discovery and deep conversation.
It becomes increasingly clear that this kind of education, Luddite though it may appear, is not a turning back, but a looking forward. It is one of the few places available for our young people to face, as Dr. Worthen put it, that these devices are our tools, not our masters.
Sarah Davis
Santa Fe, N.M.
To the Editor:
The idea of creating a "monastery" within a larger university has some merit, especially given how distracted so many of our young adults are with their phones, computers and a nearly ubiquitous digital "panopticon" that has become part of not only college, but also where and how we live.
For Molly Worthen's concept to work, however, it would be necessary to get the full buy-in of the college faculty and administration, because everything they do is now fully digital, including homework, essay submissions, various e-chalkboards and even virtual office hours. College administration also operates its entire function digitally, including financial aid and all record-keeping.
This reminds me of Saul Bellow's introduction to Allan Bloom's classic 1987 book "The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students." Bellow recommended that, as much as possible, society's "backflow," as he put it, be kept off campus so students can concentrate on learning fundamental skills and develop their own powers of mind.
This was way before the internet and iPhones, and is timeless advice, whether digital or not.
Matthew G. Andersson
Clearwater, Fla.
To the Editor:
Molly Worthen made a sound argument for the creation of classes and programs at universities that limit and remove technology from students' daily lives.
TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat have already affected our collective attention span. They are designed to keep their users on the platform as much as possible; the revenue the companies generate from endless advertising is their lifeblood.
Look no further than the couple at a restaurant, glued to their phones, or the student trying to complete an assignment at 11 at night, who for hours was scrolling through a TikTok feed.
The advent of artificial intelligence is drawing humans deeper into this inescapable "technology tornado." As Dr. Worthen mentioned in her essay, there are increasing numbers of educators who want students to learn how to use this in the classroom. However, doing so relieves these students of the necessary critical thinking skills that are vital to ideas and innovation.
What will society become when our ability to reflect, ponder and strategize is greatly hindered?
This article brought up a lot of questions and thoughts about not just our current quarrel with technology, but also how this will affect human civilization in the long run. Thank you, Dr. Worthen!

To the Editor:
I was a Catholic high school boarding student at Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit from 1965 to 1969. We had to observe "grand silence" every night from prayers, around 9, until we sat down at breakfast the next morning, and we were not permitted to listen to the radio or watch TV while at the seminary.
Although we were not monks, in preparation to eventually become priests, we were cut off from "the world" and were taught to be "in the world but not of it."
Molly Worthen captures well the unexpected benefits of an imposed silence in the cases she describes at universities. Although it felt strange living that "vow of silence" as a teenager -- long before the age of the internet and iPhones! -- I treasure the lessons learned by living periods of each day in silence.
Many of my friends over the years have had nonstop background sounds of music playing on the radio all day (and night) or switched on the TV as soon as they awoke each morning. No car ride was possible without the radio blaring. I choose carefully which programs I listen to on the radio and am selective about my TV viewing -- only at night for the news and some favorite shows on Netflix and Paramount+.
In the end, I did not become a priest, but I cherish the value of a somewhat "monkish" existence, living comfortably with silence and deep into my own thoughts. As a university instructor, I encourage my students to learn to do the same.

Prizes in the Arts Do Have Meaning and Value
To the Editor:
Re "What Prizes Mean (and What They Don't)," by Roger Rosenblatt (Opinion guest essay, May 28):
In the late 1980s, a critics' prize for live theater in the Dallas-Fort Worth area was established by me and a few other reviewers: the Dallas Theater Critics Forum Awards. It eventually died because of Covid and because of the decimation of jobs in the media, especially for professional critics.
But at the time, there wasn't anything like it in the area. We didn't award single "best of" prizes, nor did we use the term "winning." That's because the fundamental reason for establishing such a prize was simple enough.
Live theater is one of the most ephemeral of arts. It mostly vanishes. But 20 or 30 years on, after the memories have faded -- memories of all the work that talented writers, actors, designers and directors had put into a production -- the artists would have at least this one thing to point to.
It would be proof that, at one point in time, a group of relatively knowledgeable people felt that what I did was worth this public acknowledgment.

To the Editor:
When I was 24, I won a Ruth Lilly and Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Poetry Fellowship. At the time I was just starting an uncertain career as a visiting professor at a small liberal arts college in Indiana. After a few months at the college, I knew I had to leave.
Though I loved my students and colleagues, I couldn't abide living in a town where the number of Confederate flags outweighed the number of other Black people I saw in a given week. Having the money from my fellowship allowed me to move back to Chicago and purchase a home.
My story is far more mild than others. I know friends who have used prize money to exit abusive relationships or access health care for chronic illnesses.
Prizes can furnish people with resources and access to live their lives. Until we live in a country with a more robust commitment to caring for people, if you find prizes distasteful, then resolve to not apply or accept them in hopes that someone with more pressing needs might get one.

Re "Arctic May Lose Nearly All Summer Sea Ice as Early as 2030s" (news article, June 7):
Sadly, it's conceivable that someday in the not too distant future, a parent will speak the idiom "Just the tip of the iceberg" to their child, and the child will ask, "What's an iceberg?" Lord help us.

Adams Criticized on Deals for Film Studio and Soccer Stadium: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Generous incentives will secure a project that keeps New York's motion picture industry competitive, officials say. Critics call the price too steep.
Developers hoping to snap up big city real estate often persuade local officials to shower them with taxpayer-funded incentives to seal the deal and prevent them from taking their business elsewhere.
But a new film studio set to go up on a Midtown Manhattan pier stands out as an especially sweet deal, at an especially difficult time for New York.
The administration of Mayor Eric Adams has said the project is a significant win for the future of the city and for taxpayers, but it involves subsidies that, to some residents and experts, seem unnecessarily generous.
The city will contribute tens of millions of dollars to fixing and maintaining the pier, something it does not automatically do in such projects, and it will exempt the development from any form of property taxes. It has also set a much lower rent for the location than tenants at neighboring piers pay.
Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the W. E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, a research group in Michigan, said that New York City's concessions for the project were "very high," and on par with offers typically used to attract major employers like car- and battery-manufacturing plants.
The pier project revives an age-old debate in New York City and beyond about the pros and cons of offering hefty incentives to attract development and businesses; the opaque and often overstated projections of economic impact; and whether such concessions are necessary in the first place. The core question is whether such generosity is vital to keeping a city competitive or does more harm in the long term, straining budgets and essential services.
City officials said the studio project and another recent initiative that includes similar incentives, for a professional soccer stadium in a mixed-use development in Queens, are essential to New York as it emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic. The first project will provide jobs; the second will also produce affordable housing, which the city desperately needs.
At the pier, the incentives were also meant to ensure the project moved forward as quickly as possible, officials said, arguing that the new studio would help keep New York's film industry competitive.
"We feel very good about these deals, you know," Andrew Kimball, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said in an interview.
But, Mr. Bartik said, with the studio expected to create 400 jobs, the city's concessions -- including reduced rent and tax exemptions -- work out to about $ 215,000 per worker over the first 15 years of a possible 99-year lease. Incentives of that size are common in economic-development deals nationwide, he added, but the median amount per worker is about $ 50,000.
"This is a very high bid that only seems justified if you think this project is absolutely critical to the future of the film industry in New York," Mr. Bartik said.
The film-production industry, which receives major subsidies in New York, has grown rapidly in the city over the past decade, with new studios opening in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, some involving major players like Netflix and Robert De Niro.
Yet, a group of local, state and federal officials, joined by community leaders, are questioning the studio deal, saying the location -- Pier 94, near West 52nd Street in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood -- is prime real estate that should not require concessions to be developed.
These critics pointed out that the same real estate group now developing the site promised previous city administrations it would build there years ago and never did. And they questioned the decision by the Adams administration to let the company, Vornado Realty Trust, develop an entirely new project in an arrangement that was not subject to competitive bidding.
"From an economic development standpoint, it's a giveaway," said Jeffrey LeFrancois, the chair of Manhattan Community Board 4, which covers a stretch of the West Side that includes the pier. "Given that Vornado has already had the ability to do this the past 13 years and done nothing, it's outrageous that they are taking this pier from taxpayers for pennies on the dollar."
Mr. LeFrancois said the terms were particularly friendly because Vornado, which primarily operates office buildings in New York City, has been eager to find new revenue sources as companies jettison physical offices. "Subsides are a part of doing business," he said, "but the loss the city has decided to take here is beyond the standard, given the 99-year lease term."
The two projects on city-owned property further cement the Adams administration's alignment with the real estate industry: "I am real estate," Mr. Adams, a small-time landlord, said during his run for mayor.
The relationship is mutually beneficial: Developers get to build on city land, and the mayor gets to point to new projects as evidence that he is leading New York out of the pandemic.
In Queens, the mayor has touted a plan to redevelop a swath of the borough that will include the new soccer stadium and what officials have described as the largest construction of entirely affordable housing since the Mitchell-Lama developments of the 1970s. Like other stadiums in the city, the new one will not pay property taxes, although the team that will play there, the New York City Football Club, will pay some rent.
That puts the deal a notch above previous stadium deals the city has made, said Sean Campion, the director of housing and economic development studies at the Citizens Budget Commission.
But economists who study stadium subsidies tend to agree that the costs of such deals typically exceed the benefits, and in January, the city's Independent Budget Office said the cost of waiving property taxes on the soccer stadium would be at least $ 516 million in lost revenue over the team's 49-year lease. (Mr. Kimball called the report "devoid of reality," because it assumed another developer would have wanted or been able to build on the land.)
At the pier, the city pledged $ 73.5 million for repairing and maintaining the property until 2060 and set a starting rent of $ 4 per square foot, or about $ 900,000 a year. Annual rent would peak at $ 2.8 million in 86 years. Vornado, which would share some of the studio's revenue with the city, would take over responsibility for the pier in 2060.
In comparison, tenants like Chelsea Piers and the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum that occupy piers operated by the Hudson River Park Trust, which is controlled by the state and city governments, are required to maintain their piers themselves. The museum spends about $ 1 million a year on its location, Pier 86, and sometimes millions more if repairs are needed, a museum official said.
Chelsea Piers has spent $ 80 million since 2010 to maintain its piers, the company said, and it pays the trust about $ 9 million a year in rent -- more than twice per square foot what Vornado's base rent will be. Chelsea Piers' annual rent is expected to reach about $ 31.4 million in 2065.
"Given its prime location on Manhattan's West Side waterfront, it is unclear whether or not the cost per square foot is sufficient," a group of elected officials, including Representative Jerrold Nadler and Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, wrote of the pier deal in a recent letter to the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Vornado is a publicly traded company whose stock has been battered since early 2020, and the project could ultimately involve Hudson Pacific Properties, which owns film studios on the West Coast and in England, and the private equity firm Blackstone as partners.
Vornado also holds the lease at the adjacent Pier 92, which, like Pier 94, extends into the Hudson. More than a decade ago, Vornado promised to double the size of an exhibition center already at the location.
The company never followed through, leading to tense arguments between officials in previous administrations and Vornado executives, according to two people familiar with the discussions who described them on condition of anonymity. Under the current deal, the studio would be built on Pier 94 and the city would take back Pier 92, which was deemed unsafe in 2019 because of structural problems.
Mr. Kimball said the rent paid by the studio would be comparable to what Steiner Studios, the largest studio in the United States outside Hollywood, pays for its recent expansion in the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn. The piles at Pier 94 are in immediate need of repair, making it necessary for the city to cover those costs to move the project forward, he said.
A Vornado spokesman said in a statement that the studio project would also create public amenities, including public restrooms and open spaces, and 1,300 construction jobs, and would "solidify New York City's position as a leading market for content production and studio space."
Mr. Kimball suggested it was unfair to compare the Vornado pier deal with deals at the Hudson River Park Trust's piers. "In economic development, there's no cookie cutter," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Alone in a shack in the Montana wilderness, he fashioned homemade bombs and launched a violent one-man campaign to destroy industrial society.
Theodore J. Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber, who attacked academics, businessmen and random civilians with homemade bombs from 1978 to 1995, killing three people and injuring 23 with the stated goal of fomenting the collapse of the modern social order -- a violent spree that ended after what was often described as the longest and most costly manhunt in American history -- died on Saturday in a federal prison medical center in Butner, N.C. He was 81.
A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said Mr. Kaczynski was found unresponsive in his cell early in the morning. The bureau did not specify a cause, but three people familiar with the situation said he died by suicide.
The bureau had announced his transfer to the medical facility in 2021.
Mr. Kaczynski traced a singular path in American life: lonely boy genius to Harvard-trained star of pure mathematics, to rural recluse, to notorious murderer, to imprisoned extremist.
In the public eye, he fused two styles of violence: the periodic targeting of the demented serial killer, and the ideological fanaticism of the terrorist.
After he was captured by about 40 F.B.I. agents in April 1996, Mr. Kaczynski's particular ideology was less the subject of debate than the question of whether his crimes should be dignified with a rational motive to begin with.
Victims railed against commentators who took seriously a 35,000-word manifesto that he had written to justify his actions and evangelize the ideas that he claimed inspired them.
Psychologists involved in the trial saw his writing as evidence of schizophrenia. His lawyers tried to mount an insanity defense -- and when Mr. Kaczynski rebelled and sought to represent himself in court, risking execution to do so, his lawyers said that that was yet further evidence of insanity.
For years before the manifesto was published, Mr. Kaczynski (pronounced kah-ZIN-skee) had no reputation beyond that of a twisted reveler in violence, picking victims seemingly at random, known only by a mysterious-sounding nickname with roots in the F.B.I.'s investigation into him: "the Unabomber." It became widely publicized that some of his victims lost their fingers while opening a package bomb. Simply going through the mail prompted flickers of nervousness in many Americans.
After his arrest, Mr. Kaczynski's extraordinary biography emerged. He had scored 167 on an I.Q. test as a boy and entered Harvard at 16. In graduate school, at the University of Michigan, he worked in a field of mathematics so esoteric that a member of his dissertation committee estimated that only 10 or 12 people in the country understood it. By 25, he was an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
Then he dropped out -- not just from Berkeley, but from civilization. Starting in 1971 and continuing until his arrest, he lived in a shack he built himself in rural Montana. He forsook running water, read by the light of homemade candles, stopped filing federal tax returns and subsisted on rabbits.
Mr. Kaczynski's manifesto -- published jointly by The New York Times and The Washington Post in 1995 under the threat of continued violence -- argued that damage to the environment and the alienating effects of technology were so heinous that the social and industrial underpinnings of modern life should be destroyed.
A vast majority of Americans determined that the Unabomber must be a psychopath the moment they heard of him, and while he was front-page news, his text did not generally find receptive readers outside a tiny fringe of the environmental movement. The term "Unabomber" entered popular discourse as shorthand for the type of brainy misfit who might harbor terrifying impulses.
Yet political change and the passage of time caused some to see Mr. Kaczynski in a new light. His manifesto accorded centrality to a healthy environment without mentioning global warming; it warned about the dangers of people becoming "dependent" on technology while making scant reference to the internet. To young people afflicted by social media anomie and fearful of climate doom, Mr. Kaczynski seemed to wield a predictive power that outstripped the evidence available to him.
In 2017 and 2020, Netflix released documentaries about him. He maintained postal correspondence with thousands of people -- journalists, students and die-hard supporters. In 2018, Wired magazine announced "the Unabomber's odd and furious online revival," and New York magazine called him "an unlikely prophet to a new generation of acolytes."
Becoming 'the Unabomber'
Mr. Kaczynski's infamous label came from "UNABOM," the F.B.I.'s code for university and airline bombing. That designation was inspired by his first targets, from 1978 to 1980: academics at Northwestern University, the president of United Airlines and the passengers of a flight from Chicago to Washington. The victims suffered cuts, burns and smoke inhalation. The authorities were aided in connecting several early attacks by the fact that the mysterious initials "FC" had been engraved on the bombs or spray-painted near the explosions.
The Unabomber struck one to four times a year for most years until 1987, when he left a bomb at a computer store in Salt Lake City. A woman remembered making eye contact with the man who had dropped off the package that later exploded, and soon a sketch was publicized of a mustachioed suspect wearing sunglasses and a hoodie.
Six years passed without an attack. Then, in June 1993, the Unabomber struck twice in the same week.
Packages containing bombs arrived at the home of Charles Epstein, a geneticist at the University of California San Francisco, and at the office of David Gelernter, a computer scientist at Yale University. Each man lost multiple fingers. Mr. Epstein sustained permanent hearing loss; Mr. Gelernter, whose office burst into flames, bled nearly to the point of death and lost much of the vision in his right eye.
The Unabomber was growing in infamy and deadliness even as his motives became harder to parse. His first fatality, in 1985, was Hugh Scrutton, an owner of a Sacramento computer store who was engaged to be married. Between December 1994 and April 1995, he killed two more men, seemingly with no relation to Mr. Scrutton or to each other: a New Jersey advertising executive and a lobbyist for the California forestry industry. The adman, Thomas Mosser, was married with three children. The lobbyist, Gilbert Murray, was married with two children. He was so mutilated in the blast that his family was permitted to see him only from the knees down as a farewell.
It was that April, the same month as Mr. Murray's killing, when this nameless terrorist unveiled an identity. Writing on behalf of "the terrorist group FC" -- which, he explained, stood for "Freedom Club" -- the Unabomber sent The New York Times a letter offering a "bargain." He promised to stop hurting people -- though not to stop attacking property -- in exchange for getting a long article about his ideas published in a major periodical.
In June, The Times and The Washington Post received a 35,000-word manuscript. Citing a recommendation from the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice, the papers took the Unabomber's offer. They split the cost of printing the essay, titled "Industrial Society and Its Future." The Post distributed it online and as an eight-page supplement with the Sept. 19 print paper.
The manifesto claimed that the current organization of society gives "politicians, corporation executives and remote, anonymous technicians and bureaucrats" control over "the life-and-death issues of one's existence." That makes modern people depressed, unlike "primitive man," who gained satisfaction from determining his own "life-and-death issues" and found "a sense of security" in what the Unabomber called "WILD nature."
The Unabomber justified his murderous campaign on the grounds that it got "our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression."
The unique circumstances of the manifesto's distribution -- William Finnegan, writing in The New Yorker, called it "the most extraordinary manuscript submission in the history of publishing" -- prompted a debate about the ethics of disseminating a terrorist's views. The publicity seemed vindicated, however, after news of the Unabomber reached Linda Patrik, an associate philosophy professor vacationing in Paris. At first jokingly, then insistently, she told her husband that the manifesto reminded her of what he had said about his eccentric loner brother.
Ms. Patrik's husband was David Kaczynski. When he read the manifesto online, his "jaw dropped," he later told The Times. The language was reminiscent of letters Ted had written to David. He soon reached out to the authorities.
Since 1979, an F.B.I. team that grew to more than 150 full-time investigators, analysts and others had gone through tens of thousands of leads without getting close to a real suspect. After hearing from David Kaczynski, the authorities zeroed in on a 10-by-12-foot wooden shack in rural Montana. The area was so remote that during an 18-day stakeout, one agent saw a cougar kill a deer.
The home had two windows set on high; they caught light but kept the home hidden. Agents could not see inside. On April 3, 1996, one of them shouted that a forest ranger needed help. A thin, shaggy man emerged from the cabin. He was grabbed from both sides.
A 'Walking Brain'
Theodore John Kaczynski was born in Chicago on May 22, 1942. His father, Theodore Richard Kaczynski, worked at his family's business, Kaczynski's Sausages, a factory on the city's South Side. His mother, Wanda (Dombek) Kaczynski, was a homemaker. They both descended from Polish immigrants in the Chicago area, dropped out of high school to work and obtained diplomas at night school. By all accounts they were gregarious, kind, diligent and thoughtful. Each sent letters to newspapers in support of progressive causes.
From boyhood, Teddy, as he was known, felt his brilliance to be alienating. When an aunt of his visited, his father asked, "Why don't you have some conversation with your aunt?" Teddy replied, "Why should I? She wouldn't understand me anyway."
In school, he skipped two grades. He later blamed his parents for seeming to prize and cultivate his intellect over his emotions.
"He was never really seen as a person, as an individual personality," a high school classmate, Loren De Young, told The Times. "He was always regarded as a walking brain."
At Harvard, Teddy lived in Eliot House, home to the clubbiest and brawniest of the school's white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, including the varsity crew team. Clad in a tacky plaid sports jacket, Teddy would enter his suite and stride past his roommates wordlessly, then open the door to his room -- wafting the odor of rotting food -- and slam it shut.
As a sophomore, he was recruited for an experiment conducted on 22 undergraduates by an eminent Harvard psychology professor, Henry A. Murray. It turned out to be a brutal experience: Three years of deliberately abusive and humiliating mock interrogations, aimed at studying how people react under stress.
The experiment resembled screening processes for secret agents that Professor Murray had helped develop during World War II. In 2018, the Central Intelligence Agency described Professor Murray's experiment as part of MK-Ultra, a project that studied mind control, and it cited characterizations of Professor Murray's work as "disturbing" and "ethically indefensible."
Mr. Kaczynski went straight from college to graduate school in Michigan. His department would learn about new work of his by discovering, without any advance notice, his papers published in respected journals. "It was as if he could write poetry while the rest of us were trying to learn grammar," Joel Shapiro, a fellow student, later told The Times.
Mr. Kaczynski arrived at Berkeley in 1967. He taught by lecturing from the textbook and did not answer questions. Yet he continued to publish distinguished work and received a promotion in the math department. Two years later, he resigned, without explaining the decision to his colleagues.
The Kaczynski brothers split the cost of the property in Montana, then had a falling-out when David got engaged in 1989. After Ted's arrest, New York Times reporters searched for friends of his in the seven states he was known to have lived in or visited. They found nobody. Some fellow students of his in graduate school said they were amazed to find that they did not remember him at all. He was widely reported never to have had a romantic relationship.
During his Montana years, Mr. Kaczynski had the librarian in Lincoln, the town closest to his shack, obtain for him obscure volumes of science and literature, sometimes in the original German or Spanish. In an interview after his arrest with the British publication Green Anarchist, he described inventing gods for himself, including a "Grandfather Rabbit," who was responsible for the existence of the snowshoe rabbits that were his main source of meat in the winter.
In the same interview, Mr. Kaczynski described how he had felt goaded to violence. His favorite part of the wilderness had been a two-day hike from his shack -- a plateau with steep ravines and a waterfall. In 1983, he found a road paved through it.
"You just can't imagine how upset I was," he said. "It was from that point on I decided that, rather than trying to acquire further wilderness skills, I would work on getting back at the system. Revenge."
That was his own narrative. Some details of his life indicated a predisposition to violence and an estrangement from the surrounding world that might also have accounted for his behavior. According to The Atlantic, Mr. Kaczynski had begun to imagine committing murder by the age of 27. In his diary, he described his bombs as giving him catharsis. Though he broke ties with his brother, Ted said he would open David's letters if the stamp was underlined as a sign of emergency. David wrote to say that their father was dying and underlined the stamp.
"Ted wrote back, and the response was fairly peculiar," David told The Times -- "basically, that I had done well, that this was something worth communicating."
His brother is his only immediate survivor.
At a super-maximum-security prison in Colorado, Mr. Kaczynski struck up friendships with inmates in neighboring cells: Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, and Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber. Mr. Kaczynski shared books and talked politics with them, and he got to know their birthdays, Yahoo News reported in 2016.
His terrorist strategy, and the ideas that he said undergirded it, enjoyed an afterlife few would have predicted in the 1990s.
The Norwegian news media reported that Anders Breivik, who killed dozens of people at government buildings and at a youth summer camp in 2011, lifted passages from Mr. Kaczynski's manifesto in a manifesto of his own. More curious was the way a variety of law-abiding Americans developed an interest in the same line of thought.
In 2017, the deputy editor of the conservative publication First Things, Elliot Milco, credited Mr. Kaczynski with "astute (even prophetic) insights." In 2021, during an interview with the businessman and politician Andrew Yang, Tucker Carlson cited Mr. Kaczynski's thinking in detail without any prompting.
Online, young people with a variety of partisan allegiances, or none at all, have developed an intricate vocabulary of half-ironic Unabomber support. They proclaim themselves "anti-civ" or #tedpilled; they refer to "Uncle Ted." Videos on TikTok of Unabomber-related songs, voice-overs and dances have acquired millions of views, according to a 2021 article in The Baffler.
Mr. Kaczynski was no longer the mysterious killer who had belatedly projected an outlandish justification for violence; now he was the originator of one of many styles of transgression and all-knowing condemnation to adopt online. His crimes lay in a past young people had never known, and he was imprisoned, no longer an active threat to society.
His online support did not indicate how many eco-terrorists had been newly minted, but it did measure a prevalence of cynicism, boredom, dissatisfaction with modern life and gloom about its prospects for change.
During his imprisonment, Mr. Kaczynski copied his correspondence by hand and forwarded it to the University of Michigan's Joseph A. Labadie Collection, an archive devoted to radical protest, which has amassed dozens of boxes of Kaczynskiana.
According to New York magazine, Mr. Kaczynski's papers became one of the collection's most popular offerings. In an interview with the magazine, Julie Herrada, the collection's curator, declined to describe the people so intrigued by Mr. Kaczynski that they visit the library to look through his archive. She said just one thing: "Nobody seems crazy."

A Pier Deal Is Full of Developer Perks, but Is It Good for the City?

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NEW YORK — Developers hoping to snap up big city real estate often persuade local officials to shower them with taxpayer-funded incentives to seal the deal and prevent them from taking their business elsewhere.
But a new film studio set to go up on a midtown Manhattan pier stands out as an especially sweet deal, at an especially difficult time for New York.
The administration of Mayor Eric Adams has said the project is a significant win for the future of the city and for taxpayers, but it involves subsidies that, to some residents and experts, seem unnecessarily generous.
The city will contribute tens of millions of dollars to fixing and maintaining the pier, something it does not automatically do in such projects, and it will exempt the development from any form of property taxes. It has also set a much lower rent for the location than tenants at neighboring piers pay.
Timothy J. Bartik, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, a research group in Michigan, said that New York City’s concessions for the project were “very high,” and on par with offers typically used to attract major employers like car- and battery-manufacturing plants.
The pier project revives an age-old debate in New York City and beyond about the pros and cons of offering hefty incentives to attract development and businesses; the opaque and often overstated projections of economic impact; and whether such concessions are necessary in the first place. The core question is whether such generosity is vital to keeping a city competitive or does more harm in the long term, straining budgets and essential services.
City officials said the studio project and another recent initiative that includes similar incentives, for a professional soccer stadium in a mixed-use development in Queens, are essential to New York as it emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. The first project will provide jobs; the second will also produce affordable housing, which the city desperately needs.
At the pier, the incentives were also meant to ensure the project moved forward as quickly as possible, officials said, arguing that the new studio would help keep New York’s film industry competitive.
“We feel very good about these deals, you know,” Andrew Kimball, the president of the New York City Economic Development Corp., said in an interview.
But, Bartik said, with the studio expected to create 400 jobs, the city’s concessions — including reduced rent and tax exemptions — work out to about $215,000 per worker over the first 15 years of a possible 99-year lease. Incentives of that size are common in economic-development deals nationwide, he added, but the median amount per worker is about $50,000.
“This is a very high bid that only seems justified if you think this project is absolutely critical to the future of the film industry in New York,” Bartik said.
The film-production industry, which receives major subsidies in New York, has grown rapidly in the city over the past decade, with new studios opening in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, some involving major players like Netflix and Robert De Niro.
Yet, a group of local, state and federal officials, joined by community leaders, are questioning the studio deal, saying the location — Pier 94, near West 52nd Street in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood — is prime real estate that should not require concessions to be developed.
These critics pointed out that the same real estate group now developing the site promised previous city administrations it would build there years ago and never did. And they questioned the decision by the Adams administration to let the company, Vornado Realty Trust, develop an entirely new project in an arrangement that was not subject to competitive bidding.
“From an economic development standpoint, it’s a giveaway,” said Jeffrey LeFrancois, the chair of Manhattan Community Board 4, which covers a stretch of the West Side that includes the pier. “Given that Vornado has already had the ability to do this the past 13 years and done nothing, it’s outrageous that they are taking this pier from taxpayers for pennies on the dollar.”
LeFrancois said the terms were particularly friendly because Vornado, which primarily operates office buildings in New York City, has been eager to find new revenue sources as companies jettison physical offices. “Subsides are a part of doing business,” he said, “but the loss the city has decided to take here is beyond the standard, given the 99-year lease term.”
The two projects on city-owned property further cement the Adams administration’s alignment with the real estate industry: “I am real estate,” Adams, a small-time landlord, said during his run for mayor.
The relationship is mutually beneficial: Developers get to build on city land, and the mayor gets to point to new projects as evidence that he is leading New York out of the pandemic.
In Queens, the mayor has touted a plan to redevelop a swath of the borough that will include the new soccer stadium and what officials have described as the largest construction of entirely affordable housing since the Mitchell-Lama developments of the 1970s. Like other stadiums in the city, the new one will not pay property taxes, although the team that will play there, the New York City Football Club, will pay some rent.
That puts the deal a notch above previous stadium deals the city has made, said Sean Campion, the director of housing and economic development studies at the Citizens Budget Commission.
But economists who study stadium subsidies tend to agree that the costs of such deals typically exceed the benefits, and in January, the city’s Independent Budget Office said the cost of waiving property taxes on the soccer stadium would be at least $516 million in lost revenue over the team’s 49-year lease. (Kimball called the report “devoid of reality,” because it assumed another developer would have wanted or been able to build on the land.)
At the pier, the city pledged $73.5 million for repairing and maintaining the property until 2060 and set a starting rent of $4 per square foot, or about $900,000 a year. Annual rent would peak at $2.8 million in 86 years. Vornado, which would share some of the studio’s revenue with the city, would take over responsibility for the pier in 2060.
In comparison, tenants like Chelsea Piers and the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum that occupy piers operated by the Hudson River Park Trust, which is controlled by the state and city governments, are required to maintain their piers themselves. The museum spends about $1 million a year on its location, Pier 86, and sometimes millions more if repairs are needed, a museum official said.
Chelsea Piers has spent $80 million since 2010 to maintain its piers, the company said, and it pays the trust about $9 million a year in rent — more than twice per square foot what Vornado’s base rent will be. Chelsea Piers’ annual rent is expected to reach about $31.4 million in 2065.
“Given its prime location on Manhattan’s West Side waterfront, it is unclear whether or not the cost per square foot is sufficient,” a group of elected officials, including Rep. Jerrold Nadler and Mark Levine, the Manhattan borough president, wrote of the pier deal in a recent letter to the city’s Economic Development Corp.
Vornado is a publicly traded company whose stock has been battered since early 2020, and the project could ultimately involve Hudson Pacific Properties, which owns film studios on the West Coast and in England, and the private equity firm Blackstone as partners.
Vornado also holds the lease at the adjacent Pier 92, which, like Pier 94, extends into the Hudson. More than a decade ago, Vornado promised to double the size of an exhibition center already at the location.
The company never followed through, leading to tense arguments between officials in previous administrations and Vornado executives, according to two people familiar with the discussions who described them on condition of anonymity. Under the current deal, the studio would be built on Pier 94 and the city would take back Pier 92, which was deemed unsafe in 2019 because of structural problems.
Kimball said the rent paid by the studio would be comparable to what Steiner Studios, the largest studio in the United States outside Hollywood, pays for its recent expansion in the Sunset Park area of Brooklyn. The piles at Pier 94 are in immediate need of repair, making it necessary for the city to cover those costs to move the project forward, he said.
A Vornado spokesperson said in a statement that the studio project would also create public amenities, including public restrooms and open spaces, and 1,300 construction jobs, and would “solidify New York City’s position as a leading market for content production and studio space.”
Kimball suggested it was unfair to compare the Vornado pier deal with deals at the Hudson River Park Trust’s piers. “In economic development, there’s no cookie cutter,” he said.

Full text: Alone in a shack in the Montana wilderness, he fashioned homemade bombs and launched a violent one-man campaign to destroy industrial society.
Theodore J. Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber, who attacked academics, businessmen and random civilians with homemade bombs from 1978 to 1995, killing three people and injuring 23 with the stated goal of fomenting the collapse of the modern social order -- a violent spree that ended after what was often described as the longest and most costly manhunt in American history -- died on Saturday in a federal prison medical center in Butner, N.C. He was 81.
A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said Mr. Kaczynski was found unresponsive in his cell early in the morning. The bureau did not specify a cause, but three people familiar with the situation said he died by suicide.
The bureau had announced his transfer to the medical facility in 2021.
Mr. Kaczynski traced a singular path in American life: lonely boy genius to Harvard-trained star of pure mathematics, to rural recluse, to notorious murderer, to imprisoned extremist.
In the public eye, he fused two styles of violence: the periodic targeting of the demented serial killer, and the ideological fanaticism of the terrorist.
After he was captured by about 40 F.B.I. agents in April 1996, Mr. Kaczynski's particular ideology was less the subject of debate than the question of whether his crimes should be dignified with a rational motive to begin with.
Victims railed against commentators who took seriously a 35,000-word manifesto that he had written to justify his actions and evangelize the ideas that he claimed inspired them.
Psychologists involved in the trial saw his writing as evidence of schizophrenia. His lawyers tried to mount an insanity defense -- and when Mr. Kaczynski rebelled and sought to represent himself in court, risking execution to do so, his lawyers said that that was yet further evidence of insanity.
For years before the manifesto was published, Mr. Kaczynski (pronounced kah-ZIN-skee) had no reputation beyond that of a twisted reveler in violence, picking victims seemingly at random, known only by a mysterious-sounding nickname with roots in the F.B.I.'s investigation into him: "the Unabomber." It became widely publicized that some of his victims lost their fingers while opening a package bomb. Simply going through the mail prompted flickers of nervousness in many Americans.
After his arrest, Mr. Kaczynski's extraordinary biography emerged. He had scored 167 on an I.Q. test as a boy and entered Harvard at 16. In graduate school, at the University of Michigan, he worked in a field of mathematics so esoteric that a member of his dissertation committee estimated that only 10 or 12 people in the country understood it. By 25, he was an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
Then he dropped out -- not just from Berkeley, but from civilization. Starting in 1971 and continuing until his arrest, he lived in a shack he built himself in rural Montana. He forsook running water, read by the light of homemade candles, stopped filing federal tax returns and subsisted on rabbits.
Mr. Kaczynski's manifesto -- published jointly by The New York Times and The Washington Post in 1995 under the threat of continued violence -- argued that damage to the environment and the alienating effects of technology were so heinous that the social and industrial underpinnings of modern life should be destroyed.
A vast majority of Americans determined that the Unabomber must be a psychopath the moment they heard of him, and while he was front-page news, his text did not generally find receptive readers outside a tiny fringe of the environmental movement. The term "Unabomber" entered popular discourse as shorthand for the type of brainy misfit who might harbor terrifying impulses.
Yet political change and the passage of time caused some to see Mr. Kaczynski in a new light. His manifesto accorded centrality to a healthy environment without mentioning global warming; it warned about the dangers of people becoming "dependent" on technology while making scant reference to the internet. To young people afflicted by social media anomie and fearful of climate doom, Mr. Kaczynski seemed to wield a predictive power that outstripped the evidence available to him.
In 2017 and 2020, Netflix released documentaries about him. He maintained postal correspondence with thousands of people -- journalists, students and die-hard supporters. In 2018, Wired magazine announced "the Unabomber's odd and furious online revival," and New York magazine called him "an unlikely prophet to a new generation of acolytes."
Becoming 'the Unabomber'
Mr. Kaczynski's infamous label came from "UNABOM," the F.B.I.'s code for university and airline bombing. That designation was inspired by his first targets, from 1978 to 1980: academics at Northwestern University, the president of United Airlines and the passengers of a flight from Chicago to Washington. The victims suffered cuts, burns and smoke inhalation. The authorities were aided in connecting several early attacks by the fact that the mysterious initials "FC" had been engraved on the bombs or spray-painted near the explosions.
The Unabomber struck one to four times a year for most years until 1987, when he left a bomb at a computer store in Salt Lake City. A woman remembered making eye contact with the man who had dropped off the package that later exploded, and soon a sketch was publicized of a mustachioed suspect wearing sunglasses and a hoodie.
Six years passed without an attack. Then, in June 1993, the Unabomber struck twice in the same week.
Packages containing bombs arrived at the home of Charles Epstein, a geneticist at the University of California San Francisco, and at the office of David Gelernter, a computer scientist at Yale University. Each man lost multiple fingers. Mr. Epstein sustained permanent hearing loss; Mr. Gelernter, whose office burst into flames, bled nearly to the point of death and lost much of the vision in his right eye.
The Unabomber was growing in infamy and deadliness even as his motives became harder to parse. His first fatality, in 1985, was Hugh Scrutton, an owner of a Sacramento computer store who was engaged to be married. Between December 1994 and April 1995, he killed two more men, seemingly with no relation to Mr. Scrutton or to each other: a New Jersey advertising executive and a lobbyist for the California forestry industry. The adman, Thomas Mosser, was married with three children. The lobbyist, Gilbert Murray, was married with two children. He was so mutilated in the blast that his family was permitted to see him only from the knees down as a farewell.
It was that April, the same month as Mr. Murray's killing, when this nameless terrorist unveiled an identity. Writing on behalf of "the terrorist group FC" -- which, he explained, stood for "Freedom Club" -- the Unabomber sent The New York Times a letter offering a "bargain." He promised to stop hurting people -- though not to stop attacking property -- in exchange for getting a long article about his ideas published in a major periodical.
In June, The Times and The Washington Post received a 35,000-word manuscript. Citing a recommendation from the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice, the papers took the Unabomber's offer. They split the cost of printing the essay, titled "Industrial Society and Its Future." The Post distributed it online and as an eight-page supplement with the Sept. 19 print paper.
The manifesto claimed that the current organization of society gives "politicians, corporation executives and remote, anonymous technicians and bureaucrats" control over "the life-and-death issues of one's existence." That makes modern people depressed, unlike "primitive man," who gained satisfaction from determining his own "life-and-death issues" and found "a sense of security" in what the Unabomber called "WILD nature."
The Unabomber justified his murderous campaign on the grounds that it got "our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression."
The unique circumstances of the manifesto's distribution -- William Finnegan, writing in The New Yorker, called it "the most extraordinary manuscript submission in the history of publishing" -- prompted a debate about the ethics of disseminating a terrorist's views. The publicity seemed vindicated, however, after news of the Unabomber reached Linda Patrik, an associate philosophy professor vacationing in Paris. At first jokingly, then insistently, she told her husband that the manifesto reminded her of what he had said about his eccentric loner brother.
Ms. Patrik's husband was David Kaczynski. When he read the manifesto online, his "jaw dropped," he later told The Times. The language was reminiscent of letters Ted had written to David. He soon reached out to the authorities.
Since 1979, an F.B.I. team that grew to more than 150 full-time investigators, analysts and others had gone through tens of thousands of leads without getting close to a real suspect. After hearing from David Kaczynski, the authorities zeroed in on a 10-by-12-foot wooden shack in rural Montana. The area was so remote that during an 18-day stakeout, one agent saw a cougar kill a deer.
The home had two windows set on high; they caught light but kept the home hidden. Agents could not see inside. On April 3, 1996, one of them shouted that a forest ranger needed help. A thin, shaggy man emerged from the cabin. He was grabbed from both sides.
A 'Walking Brain'
Theodore John Kaczynski was born in Chicago on May 22, 1942. His father, Theodore Richard Kaczynski, worked at his family's business, Kaczynski's Sausages, a factory on the city's South Side. His mother, Wanda (Dombek) Kaczynski, was a homemaker. They both descended from Polish immigrants in the Chicago area, dropped out of high school to work and obtained diplomas at night school. By all accounts they were gregarious, kind, diligent and thoughtful. Each sent letters to newspapers in support of progressive causes.
From boyhood, Teddy, as he was known, felt his brilliance to be alienating. When an aunt of his visited, his father asked, "Why don't you have some conversation with your aunt?" Teddy replied, "Why should I? She wouldn't understand me anyway."
In school, he skipped two grades. He later blamed his parents for seeming to prize and cultivate his intellect over his emotions.
"He was never really seen as a person, as an individual personality," a high school classmate, Loren De Young, told The Times. "He was always regarded as a walking brain."
At Harvard, Teddy lived in Eliot House, home to the clubbiest and brawniest of the school's white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, including the varsity crew team. Clad in a tacky plaid sports jacket, Teddy would enter his suite and stride past his roommates wordlessly, then open the door to his room -- wafting the odor of rotting food -- and slam it shut.
He went straight from college to graduate school in Michigan. His department would learn about new work of his by discovering, without any advance notice, his papers published in respected journals. "It was as if he could write poetry while the rest of us were trying to learn grammar," Joel Shapiro, a fellow student, later told The Times.
Mr. Kaczynski arrived at Berkeley in 1967. He taught by lecturing from the textbook and did not answer questions. Yet he continued to publish distinguished work and received a promotion in the math department. Two years later, he resigned, without explaining the decision to his colleagues.
The Kaczynski brothers split the cost of the property in Montana, then had a falling-out when David got engaged in 1989. After Ted's arrest, New York Times reporters searched for friends of his in the seven states he was known to have lived in or visited. They found nobody. Some fellow students of his in graduate school said they were amazed to find that they did not remember him at all. He was widely reported never to have had a romantic relationship.
During his Montana years, Mr. Kaczynski had the librarian in Lincoln, the town closest to his shack, obtain for him obscure volumes of science and literature, sometimes in the original German or Spanish. In an interview after his arrest with the British publication Green Anarchist, he described inventing gods for himself, including a "Grandfather Rabbit," who was responsible for the existence of the snowshoe rabbits that were his main source of meat in the winter.
In the same interview, Mr. Kaczynski described how he had felt goaded to violence. His favorite part of the wilderness had been a two-day hike from his shack -- a plateau with steep ravines and a waterfall. In 1983, he found a road paved through it.
"You just can't imagine how upset I was," he said. "It was from that point on I decided that, rather than trying to acquire further wilderness skills, I would work on getting back at the system. Revenge."
That was his own narrative. Some details of his life indicated a predisposition to violence and an estrangement from the surrounding world that might also have accounted for his behavior. According to The Atlantic, Mr. Kaczynski had begun to imagine committing murder by the age of 27. In his diary, he described his bombs as giving him catharsis. Though he broke ties with his brother, Ted said he would open David's letters if the stamp was underlined as a sign of emergency. David wrote to say that their father was dying and underlined the stamp.
"Ted wrote back, and the response was fairly peculiar," David told The Times -- "basically, that I had done well, that this was something worth communicating."
His brother is his only immediate survivor.
At a super-maximum-security prison in Colorado, Mr. Kaczynski struck up friendships with inmates in neighboring cells: Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, and Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber. Mr. Kaczynski shared books and talked politics with them, and he got to know their birthdays, Yahoo News reported in 2016.
His terrorist strategy, and the ideas that he said undergirded it, enjoyed an afterlife few would have predicted in the 1990s.
The Norwegian news media reported that Anders Breivik, who killed dozens of people at government buildings and at a youth summer camp in 2011, lifted passages from Mr. Kaczynski's manifesto in a manifesto of his own. More curious was the way a variety of law-abiding Americans developed an interest in the same line of thought.
In 2017, the deputy editor of the conservative publication First Things, Elliot Milco, credited Mr. Kaczynski with "astute (even prophetic) insights." In 2021, during an interview with the businessman and politician Andrew Yang, Tucker Carlson cited Mr. Kaczynski's thinking in detail without any prompting.
Online, young people with a variety of partisan allegiances, or none at all, have developed an intricate vocabulary of half-ironic Unabomber support. They proclaim themselves "anti-civ" or #tedpilled; they refer to "Uncle Ted." Videos on TikTok of Unabomber-related songs, voice-overs and dances have acquired millions of views, according to a 2021 article in The Baffler.
Mr. Kaczynski was no longer the mysterious killer who had belatedly projected an outlandish justification for violence; now he was the originator of one of many styles of transgression and all-knowing condemnation to adopt online. His crimes lay in a past young people had never known, and he was imprisoned, no longer an active threat to society.
His online support did not indicate how many eco-terrorists had been newly minted, but it did measure a prevalence of cynicism, boredom, dissatisfaction with modern life and gloom about its prospects for change.
During his imprisonment, Mr. Kaczynski copied his correspondence by hand and forwarded it to the University of Michigan's Joseph A. Labadie Collection, an archive devoted to radical protest, which has amassed dozens of boxes of Kaczynskiana.
According to New York magazine, Mr. Kaczynski's papers became one of the collection's most popular offerings. In an interview with the magazine, Julie Herrada, the collection's curator, declined to describe the people so intrigued by Mr. Kaczynski that they visit the library to look through his archive. She said just one thing: "Nobody seems crazy."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: From the breathless media coverage of Ron DeSantis's recent visits to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, you could easily get the impression that:
Voting starts in approximately five minutes.
You're really watching a new Netflix series about a body snatcher's attempts to pantomime just enough humanity to amass power on Planet Earth.
The Florida governor's entire candidacy hinges on his wife, Casey DeSantis.
She could be RuPaul at a drag ball for all the attention she's getting. She could be the sorcerer in Disney's "Fantasia" for all the magic journalists are primed for: When she's with her grumpy guv, will her sunshine melt his ice? Can her aptitude for small talk make up for his allergy to it? And when she trots out the couple's three children, ages 3 to 6, will voters be reminded of and charmed by her husband's youth? (He's 44 to Donald Trump's 76.)
Those are the wrong questions about Casey DeSantis. And they reflect how wrongly we in the media often approach the subject of political spouses in general.
We wildly overestimate their potential impact on a politician's image. I've spoken to many, many voters over the years, and I've emerged from exactly zero of those conversations thinking: "Wow, Barack is going to owe Michelle for a few hundred of this state's votes." Or: "Tipper just swung that state out of Al's win column."
Back when Bill Clinton was running for the White House, some pundits cast Hillary Clinton as a poison pill with voters in the middle. Last I checked, he won two presidential elections in a row.
And I challenge you to find me one voter, just one, whose pro or con decision about Trump hinged on his third wife. Where, by the way, is she? And how, pray tell, did she assist his 2016 victory? I'd forgotten all about her until she came up the other day in a Daily Beast headline that called Casey DeSantis "the Walmart Melania." Better than "the Bergdorf Melania," which would be redundant. It would also summon thoughts of a certain dressing room and would disregard Republicans' populist conversion. They're now all about the little guy and gal! Well, except when they're doling out tax cuts.
But while we tend to exaggerate the importance of what a spouse does in public, we sometimes shortchange the relevance of what a spouse does in private. That's where and how Casey DeSantis probably matters most.
By many accounts, including an especially thorough profile of her by Michael Kruse in Politico recently, she's "uncommonly involved" (Kruse's words) in all aspects of her husband's career: strategy, policy, the friends-and-enemies scorecard. He doesn't simply turn to her in a dutiful, chivalrous, "And what do you think, honey?" fashion. She's no afterthought. She's the first thought. And the second thought. And the very last thought.
The political spouse I observed most closely, Laura Bush, was much more consequential behind the scenes than in front of the cameras. She in fact recoiled from the spotlight. But George W.'s aides relished her presence on the campaign trail with him because she calmed him, grounded him, took the bluster out of him whenever he was getting blustery.
She read the news coverage about him so that he didn't have to, and she would tell him what he needed to know but not what would make him fume pointlessly at us journalists in the back of the plane. That was her impact -- not the way she dressed, not how she styled her hair, not the degree of verve or humor with which she delivered public remarks when she consented to do that. She regulated his emotional temperature.
I get the impression that Jill Biden does likewise with Joe, to an extent that could be absolutely critical to what happens in November 2024.
That Jill gets a say and gets her way was clear in a priceless anecdote that she included in her 2019 memoir, "Where the Light Enters." She recalled being by the pool and hearing her husband's political advisers, who were inside with him, trying to persuade him to enter the 2004 presidential race. She and Joe had ruled that out.
"A Sharpie caught my eye," she wrote. "I drew NO on my stomach in big letters, and marched through the room in my bikini."
President Biden is 80. It's not ageist to observe that over the months between now and Election Day, he must pace himself carefully, watch his health closely, do all he can to decrease the odds of any stammer or stumble that will be turned against him. He must stay focused and optimistic, which means tuning out as much of the Hunter Biden melodrama as he can. Rest is vital. Mood is pivotal.
And no one -- not Ron Klain, not Mike Donilon, not Anita Dunn -- can help with that the way Jill can. So, you go ahead and put Walmart Melania under a microscope. I'll be over here putting White House Jill on a pedestal.

Words Worth Sidelining: Canine Edition
My computers' operating systems demand to be updated yearly, it seems. Several of my apps cry out for renewal every few months. So how is it that archaic sayings hang around for not just decades but centuries past the point of any coherence?
I direct you to the doggedness of phrases that invoke dogs. I can't square them with the ways of my dog, Regan, and of most of the other American pooches I know.
It's still said that someone "works like a dog." How many of the dogs around you do arduous physical labor -- do any physical labor -- or keep even a 9-to-5 schedule of other tasks? Barking at the Amazon delivery person doesn't count.
A hypochondriacal friend of mine always announces: "I'm sick as a dog!" In my experience, dogs are significantly hardier than we humans. No cold compresses, no hot tea, no Purell, no Pepto Bismol.
"A dog's life" means a harsh one, never mind the Instagram parade of golden retrievers in platinum digs, French bulldogs in haute couture and Siberian huskies that will never come within a snowball's toss of a sled (or of Siberia).
And those furry social-media stars nosh on treats, not one another. So the phrase "dog-eat-dog world" baffles me. They're dachshunds, not the Donner party.
Also, I detect, at least in English, some semantic inequality between dogs and cats, with the former starring in more negative metaphors ("lie down with dogs, get up with fleas," "call off the dogs") than the latter do.
To wit: Donald Trump so frequently took a canine tack with his insults that Philip Rucker wrote an entire article in The Washington Post about how, in Trump's "singular lexicon, there is no more vicious put-down than likening an adversary to a dog." "Choked like a dog," "fired like a dog," "sweat like a dog" -- Trump had used all of those and more.
Cats got off easy. Don't they always? If someone calls you "the cat's meow," "the cat's pajamas" or a "cool cat," you have cause to purr. A "fat cat" indulging in a "cat nap" has anything but "a dog's life."
That said, I cringe at hearing that someone "let the cat out of the bag." What sadist almost suffocated the kitty in the first place?
Let's retire that phrase, along with the digs about dogs above. While we're at it, let's rethink "kill two birds with one stone." I'd rather let the feathered creatures live. And I'm not much for hurling heavy objects, just as Regan isn't much for fetching heavy, medium-weight or even light ones. She can't be bothered with all that back-and-forth when there are soft patches of grass on which to sun herself. It's a dog's life.

For the Love of Sentences
In The Washington Post, Mattie Kahn took issue with the word "fearless" being applied so often and fashionably to young women today: "We haven't really created a generation of unflinching girls. With our broken world, we've scared them into action." (Thanks to Olga Adler of Delray Beach, Fla., for nominating this.)
Also in the Post, Paul Waldman took the measure of Mike Pence's appeal beyond the Republican primaries: "Voters are not clamoring for someone to tell them why we need to cut taxes for the rich and outlaw abortion, delivered in the tone of a stepdad explaining why you're being grounded for the rest of the school year." (Adam Schmuckler, Olney, Md., and Alfred Reid, Durham, N.C.)
And David Von Drehle used the occasion of the P.G.A.-LIV golf merger to reflect on the odd career of a golfer centrally involved in it: "Greg Norman with a four-stroke lead in a major tournament was like a cat leaping onto a narrow shelf of Limoges. You just covered your eyes and waited for the sound of disaster." (Christopher Dodson, Montville, N.J., and Joe Bohr, Park City, Utah, among others) Von Drehle's article also had the clever observation that "golf was for decades -- for centuries -- the province of people who cared about money but never spoke of it openly. Scots. Episcopalians. Members of the Walker and Bush families. People who built huge homes then failed to heat them properly. People who drove around with big dogs in their old Mercedes station wagons. People who greeted the offer of a scotch and soda by saying, 'Well, it's 5 o'clock somewhere!"' (Jessica N. Lange, Beavercreek, Ohio)
In The Times, Kurt Streeter reassessed the PGA's onetime pose of rectitude in light of the merger: "The PGA Tour presented itself as the guy who calls a penalty on himself if he accidentally moves his ball a quarter-inch. Turns out it was the guy who makes a double-bogey and marks it down as a par." (John Daly, Richmond, Va., and Doug Hardy, Concord, Mass., among others)
Also in The Times, Ezra Klein marveled at how little, in the end, Republicans extracted from the debt-ceiling standoff: "Threatening default -- and we came within days of it this time -- in order to get a deal like this is like threatening to detonate a bomb beneath the bank unless the teller gives you $ 150 and a commemorative mug." (Will Rothfuss, Stroudsburg, Penn., and Anita Moran, San Francisco, among many others)
In The New Yorker, Amanda Petrusich examined Paul Simon's newest album, "Seven Psalms," a deeply spiritual reflection on human life: "Outside religious spaces, posing the big questions -- how we arrived here; what we're supposed to do with the time we've been allotted -- is generally considered the terrain of undergraduate philosophy majors and people who have gravely misjudged their tolerance for edibles." (Helen Pelletier, Portland, Maine, and Michael O'Keefe, San Juan Cosala, Mexico, among many others)
An article in The Economist assessed DeSantis's apparent reticence and long delay before he squarely took on Donald Trump: "It is as if Brutus had overslept on the Ides of March, giving Julius Caesar a chance to put on his armor, but had tried to proceed with his hit job all the same. The plot to overthrow Mr. Trump, which once seemed plausible, now looks forlorn." (Howard Stambor, Seattle, and Harry Gerecke, Vashon, Wash.)
And in GQ, Alex Pappademas had a grand time profiling the musician Dave Matthews and noted that when "someone tells you they don't like Dave Matthews, they're really voicing a deep tribal aversion to the type of person they picture when they picture a Dave Matthews fan -- spiritually incurious trustafarians, pumpkin-spice basics, fleece-vest I.P.A. bros, or whichever straw-man stereotype offends their imagination most." Matthews owns a Tesla "but he's a little embarrassed by it -- specifically the gull-wing doors, because it's basically impossible to be a rock star and get out of a car with gull-wing doors without looking like an asshole, especially if you're wearing sunglasses." (Kate Schultz, Madison, Wis.)

On a Personal Note
The presidential race is heating up, even at this early stage. The war between Ukraine and Russia continues to rage. Robert Kennedy Jr. is cyber-hobnobbing with Elon Musk, in a convergence of runaway vanity and ruinous nonsense that's scarily emblematic of the United States circa 2023.
But the article that everybody I know was talking about most over the past week was Tim Alberta's profile in The Atlantic of Chris Licht, who had been in charge at CNN for 13 baffling and tumultuous months and, it turned out, was days away from being canned.
That's largely because my circle of acquaintance is bloated with people in the news business. We can navel-gaze with the best of them. But it also reflects the richness of the portrait of Licht that Alberta deftly paints.
His article (behind a paywall, which may or may not block you) is about more than CNN, more than Licht. It's about tendencies and traps that many people have skirted or tumbled into. It's about confidence bleeding into grandiosity, defensiveness edging into reclusiveness, bluntness becoming coldness. It examines the lies we tell ourselves about the deals and compromises we've made.
The key scene, for me, is the one in which Licht huffs, puffs and perspires at an elite gym with a quirky personal trainer. He hoists a heavy pole. He does a side plank. He pushes a weighted sleigh. He tells Alberta, who's there, "Zucker couldn't do this shit." That's Jeff Zucker, who ran CNN before him.
What's the point of that statement? And why is Licht letting Alberta watch him work out? One answer -- which I can relate to as a large person who struggles to lose weight -- is that Licht was 226 pounds three years ago but 178 when Alberta spent time with him. He's surely proud of that.
But what's also happening in that scene -- what apparently happened during the whole of Licht's time at CNN -- is that someone who built his career making other people (Joe Scarborough, Stephen Colbert, Gayle King) look good is overly relishing his moment in the spotlight. He's forgetting what his job is. He's losing sight of the larger picture.
It's a recognizable human error. And it's a cautionary tale with resonance far beyond the world of journalism.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Brooklyn Museum invited the Australian comedian to help organize a show on Picasso's troubling life and artistic lens. The reaction was strong.
Some reviews were scathing, dismissing the exhibition on Picasso and feminism co-organized by the Australian comic Hannah Gadsby as weak in scholarship, thin on significant works of art and knee-jerk in its politics.
"Don't Go," blared a headline on the website Hellgate, while The Guardian asked, "Is Hannah Gadsby's Picasso exhibition really that bad?" Even Gadsby's home turf paper declared, "Hannah Gadsby's new Picasso exhibition is a joke."
Yet in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- these strong reactions, people lined up at the Brooklyn Museum for the show's opening on June 2, increasing general admission by 51 percent over the weekend before.
And the Brooklyn Museum is standing by the exhibition, "It's Pablo-matic: Picasso According to Hannah Gadsby," arguing that it had anticipated objections when it hired Gadsby, who had eviscerated the Cubist painter's misogynistic attitudes toward women in a 2018 Netflix special, "Nanette." The exhibition, its organizers said, was meant to prompt heated discussion.
"We welcome the debate," Anne Pasternak, the museum's director, said in an interview. "We knew the show was going to be controversial, and if the result is that more people are engaging with the art, we think that's frankly awesome.
"If you want a show with hundreds of Picassos, go to Paris," she added. "If you want an interesting conversation, come to Brooklyn."
The exhibition -- which was also organized by the museum's senior curators Lisa Small and Catherine Morris -- presents paintings, drawings and sculpture by Picasso alongside works by female artists in the museum's collection, to explore the Spanish artist's troublesome legacy.
Picasso abused his female muses, using them in his work; two took their own lives. "Every time I change wives I should burn the last one. That way I'd be rid of them," he once said. "They wouldn't be around to complicate my existence. Maybe, that would bring back my youth, too. You kill the woman and you wipe out the past she represents."
On a recent morning at the museum, several visitors said they were moved by the exhibition. "It's the violence that's inherent in his work that is getting to me and making me cry," said Lori Handelman, 64, who lives in New York and is retired. "It's very pointedly through an angry lens, which I think is appropriate."
Others wrestled with the show's negative take on Picasso. "It's good to make a statement like this," said Garoan Jacobs, an artist from Berlin, "but I still love Picasso."
The critical response to the Gadsby show questioned the exhibition's seriousness of purpose, arguing that Gadsby's wall banter and sarcasm had substituted for a more substantive effort to engage with the artwork. Jason Farago in The New York Times called the exhibition "essentially a light amusement," one that shortchanges the women artists in the show. He added that it "backs away from close looking for the affirmative comforts of social-justice-themed pop culture."
Alex Greenberger in Art News critiqued "the show's disregard for art history."
But several reviews applauded the exhibition's alternative approach to the typical celebration of a "genius" artist. "There is something refreshing about a show that doesn't let Picasso preen on his pedestal," wrote The Economist. "Many of his works here feature an artist in a studio with a comely nude model, a tableau that feels at once charged and vampiric. The contrast between Picasso's pert breasts and curvy hips and the female bodies created by female artists feels potent."
The Brooklyn Museum is no stranger to controversy. In 1999, the mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, threatened to cut its city financing in response to the exhibition of Chris Ofili's painting of the Virgin Mary decorated with elephant dung in the museum's "Sensation" show. In 2002, the museum hosted a "Star Wars" exhibition that reviewers criticized as lowbrow. And it was upbraided for featuring a Louis Vuitton shop in its 2008 Takashi Murakami exhibition, which included handbags. More recently, a show of work by the street artist and commercial designer KAWS garnered some tough reviews, but drew large crowds.
The Gadsby show was developed in response to an invitation extended to several institutions by the Musée Picasso to mark the 50th anniversary of Picasso's death in part by considering what the artist and his work mean today. "It seemed necessary to think about that question in terms of the culture shift brought about by feminism over the 50 years since his death," Small said.
"We wanted to foster dialogues about the myths and tropes of the male-dominated Modernist canon that Picasso exemplifies," the curator added. "It was also an opportunity to present and interpret our own collection of feminist artworks."
Among the other artists included are Mickalene Thomas, Judy Chicago and Marilyn Minter, all of whom were informed that their pieces would be in the show. Thomas and Minter declined to be interviewed.
Chicago said she saw in the derisive reviews confirmation of the misogyny that Gadsby confronted in the museum show and in "Nanette."
"There is a level of hysteria -- and hostility -- in some of the writing that reminds me of the hysteria that surrounded 'The Dinner Party,"' Chicago said, referring to her famous feminist installation from the 1970s, which resides at the Brooklyn Museum.
"There is very little space to critique the great heroes of art history, as if they're above analysis -- this very odd idea that patriarchal attitudes and misogyny do not affect either the worldview or creative production of male artists, and of course they do," Chicago said. "I celebrate and congratulate the Brooklyn Museum for trying to begin that conversation."
Similarly, the feminist collective Guerrilla Girls, which also has a work in the show, wrote in an Instagram post: "So many angry, hysterical reviews from male art critics must mean that Pablo-matic @brooklynmuseum is saying something really important."
The museum invited Gadsby -- who studied art history in college -- to collaborate on the show because of "Nanette," in which the comic and actor, who identifies as genderqueer and uses they/them pronouns, connects Picasso to Donald J. Trump and Harvey Weinstein, calls the artist "rotten in the face cavity" and proclaims, "I hate Picasso! I hate him!"
"We felt Hannah's voice was an excellent addition to an expanded conversation about Picasso's legacy," Morris said, "and the emergence of feminist revisionism and critique of modernity."
The curators worked together on conceptualizing and choosing pieces for the show, with Gadsby an integral part of the process.
The exhibition incorporates clips from "Nanette," as well as wall text by Gadsby with quips such as, "Art history taught me that, historically, women didn't have time to think thoughts -- they were too busy napping naked alone in a forest." Next to the etching on paper "Sculptor and Model Looking at Herself, 1933," the comic writes: "Alternative title: 'If I angle the mirror to reflect the sun, I can burn your face off. Look at my penis."'
As for the criticism that the exhibition is light on Picasso masterworks, with only eight paintings, Pasternak said the Brooklyn Museum was a late addition to the 50th anniversary celebrations and had difficulty securing major loans.
In interviews, Brooklyn Museum officials said that gravitas and levity were not mutually exclusive. "No one is questioning that Picasso is a prodigy or a genius," said Morris, senior curator for the museum's Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. "Humor and seriousness don't exist in opposition to each other."
Small, the museum's senior curator of European Art, said she hopes the strong reactions "don't prevent visitors from coming to the show and seeing for themselves and also doesn't have a dampening effect on other institutions that want to take risks."
Scholars in the art world, many of whom have not yet seen the Gadsby show, have been abuzz on the subject. Some see the piling on as unfair. Arnold L. Lehman, the former Brooklyn Museum director who presented the "Sensation" exhibition, said, "Not only is it critical for museums to preserve art history as the tangible evidence of civilization; it is also critical for museums to examine and debate that history."
But others view the show as a gimmick that should have been avoided. "The museum has better things to do than to make the case for women artists by beating up on Picasso," the art historian Robert Storr said. "Being anti-Picasso is so easy -- it doesn't get to any of the underlining structural issues. What's needed is a critique of institutional sexism, not the targeting of one long-dead artist who's no longer making art."

A Film Festival With a Story to Tell: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Documentaries about siblings and baseball are among the standouts in the film slate of an event that encompasses a lot more than movies.
Every spring, the Tribeca Festival returns to Lower Manhattan with a bulky mixed bag of creative programming. Looking for virtual reality? Concerts? Video games? Podcast tapings? The event, which dropped "film" from its name in 2021, lassos together all its media with the key word storytelling -- a buzzy, often branded term. Past attendees of the festival might recall Robert De Niro, one of its founders, rapping, "I've got a story to tell," at the start of a bouncy, AT&T-sponsored Tribeca trailer that preceded screenings for half a dozen years.
A tension surrounding this year's event, which runs from Wednesday through June 18, is how it coincides with a wholesale hiatus in storytelling with the Writers Guild strike in its second month and a potential SAG-AFTRA strike hovering on the horizon. The impasse, which pits Hollywood studios against creators, hangs on a question: How much does the system truly value these storytellers? The industry is in crisis, and as the guilds sound alarm bells, it will be interesting to see how Tribeca amplifies their chime.
A top U.S. film festival, Tribeca has long served as a kind of industry nexus, platforming big-studio movies beside indies. Once, the event featured Mario Van Peebles's "Baadasssss!" on the same day as "New York Minute," starring Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. This year, Disney and Pixar's "Elemental" is the centerpiece. The festival has also proven a conduit for filmmakers to go from newcomer to big deal. In 2018, Nia DaCosta premiered the crime drama "Little Woods." She's now directing "The Marvels."
The festival's juiciest titles are often the discoveries, and that was certainly the case for my favorite world premiere this year: "The Gullspang Miracle," a dazzler in the documentary competition. Like the weird love child of "Three Identical Strangers" and "Grey Gardens," the film observes the Norwegian sisters Kari and May in the afterglow of meeting Olaug, an uncanny ringer for their elder sister, Astrid, who died by suicide decades earlier. The director, Maria Fredriksson, accompanies the trio as they plumb this strange serendipity, laying bare destabilizing truths and secrets.
The competing pulls of nature and nurture underpin the film. Kari and May regard their experience as a divine act of God. Nonreligious, Olaug is skeptical, and soon, the women's honeymoon period fizzles into pettiness and pique. An ace calibrator of mood, Fredriksson charts this rift in social settings and a series of charged voice mail messages. Brace for a startling and surreal ride that marries true-crime mysteries with cringe comedy about the narcissism of nanoscopic differences.
Darker in mood and in palette is Ethan Berger's "The Line," an incisive college drama that's equal parts spectacle and parable. Alex Wolff stars as Tom, a sophomore at a Southern liberal arts school shirking his studies to romp and roughhouse with his fraternity brothers in the fictional Kappa Nu Alpha. It's fall rush season, and trouble arrives in Gettys (Austin Abrams), a promising freshman pledge whose swagger nonetheless rubs Tom's truculent roommate, Mitch (Bo Mitchell), the wrong way.
In his narrative feature debut, Berger demonstrates a knack for scene-setting. He paints the fraternity's antebellum mansion not as an animal house but rather as a tenebrous, cocaine-tinctured netherworld peopled with the preppy, white progeny of local fat cats. These boys are homophobes (not to mention racists and sexists), and yet Berger and his co-writer, Alex Russek, deliberately present the brotherhood as buttressed by a vigorous homoeroticism. Tussling is a pastime, penis remarks fill the patois and hazing hinges on a heavy dose of organized spanking.
If all that macho posturing leaves you hungry for some memorable female-driven narratives, look no further than "Richelieu" and "Cold Copy," two absorbing dramas in different registers. Both center on a woman honing her professional credo, albeit to opposite ends: In "Richelieu," Ariane (a stirring Ariane Castellanos) finds purpose as an advocate for others, while Mia (the always-on Bel Powley) of the jittery "Cold Copy" succeeds by stepping on her peers to give herself a boost.
"Richelieu" is set at a Canadian industrial plant, where Ariane is tasked with translating the Québécois French dictates of her boss into the Spanish spoken by the mill's stable of Guatemalan laborers. The filmmaker, Pier-Philippe Chevigny, makes expert use of long takes trailing characters through space, including during a climax guaranteed to leave you breathless. The equally dizzying "Cold Copy," written and directed by Roxine Helberg (once an assistant to Jean-Marc Vallée), tells of a journalism student so desperate to impress her steely professor, Diane (Tracee Ellis Ross), that she'll toss friendships and ethics out the window.
On the nonfiction end, an unusually large chunk of titles center on sports and athletes: basketball, football, baseball, ice hockey, rugby, mixed martial arts and even IndyCar racing are represented. Two standouts consider aspects of what was once called America's pastime, although in a twist, neither focuses on the major leagues. "The Saint of Second Chances," a Netflix bio-doc from Morgan Neville ("Won't You Be My Neighbor?") and Jeff Malmberg ("Marwencol"), has plenty of fun detailing the puckish stunts of independent leagues as it profiles team owner Mike Veeck, a lifelong mischief-maker (and the son of Bill Veeck, a franchise owner).
That documentary finds a rousing kindred spirit in "The League," a poetic collage of archival footage and scholarship arranged with care by the filmmaker Sam Pollard ("MLK/FBI"). The film celebrates the inception, heyday and superstars of the Negro Leagues and analyzes their legacy. There is even some overlap with "The Saint": one section touches on Bill Veeck's signing of the legend Satchel Paige, history's oldest M.L.B. rookie.
Less brawny but just as tireless are the players in Jane M. Wagner's "Break the Game," an innovative film constructed from excerpts from a vast accumulation of livestream recordings on the gaming website Twitch. Our hero is Narcissa Wright, a onetime champion now facing onslaughts of online transphobia. Hoping to set a record on a popular new game, Narcissa becomes a recluse and then an anxious wreck.
What emerges is an internecine tug of war between body and mind, and between the urges to stand out and fit in. The film -- Wagner's first -- is extremely multimedia, which is to say, extremely Tribeca. But more profoundly, the documentary probes the intriguing possibility of taking images meant for one space and repurposing them into a cogent beginning, middle and end. Put another way: Even without the pixelated bells and whistles, it's excellent storytelling.

New Strategy Works Well For Universal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The studio let viewers rent or buy movies earlier for a higher price. This made more than $ 1 billion in less than three years, with nearly no decrease in box-office sales.
In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Universal Pictures and its art-house sibling, Focus Features, set off alarm bells in Hollywood by ending the long-held practice of giving theaters an exclusive window of about 90 days to play new movies. Instead, their movies, which have since included "Jurassic World: Dominion," "Belfast," "Cocaine Bear" and "M3gan," would become available for digital rental or purchase -- at a higher price -- after as little as 17 days.
For a change-phobic industry that still views the 1981 arrival of armrest cup holders as a major innovation, the introduction of the service, known as premium video on demand, prompted extensive hand-wringing. Filmmakers and theater owners worried that ticket buyers would be more reluctant to leave their sofas if they could see the same films on their TV sets or iPads just a couple of weeks later.
Universal's competitors mostly stuck with the status quo.
But the willingness by Universal to experiment -- to challenge the "this is how we've always done it" thinking -- seems to have paid off. Universal has generated more than $ 1 billion in premium V.O.D. revenue in less than three years, while showing little-to-no decrease in ticket sales. In some cases, box-office sales even increased when films became available in homes, which Universal has decided is a side effect of premium V.O.D. advertising and word of mouth.
Universal, for instance, made "Minions: The Rise of Gru" available for premium V.O.D. after 33 days in theaters in 2022. The movie stayed in theaters after that, selling more tickets than "Minions," released in 2015, did after 33 days, according to data from Comscore, an analytics company. Data for Universal's "Jurassic World" and "Fast and Furious" franchises show a similar effect.
An interesting wrinkle: Donna Langley, the chairwoman of the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, which includes Focus Features, said the company had seen only a small decrease in revenue from traditional V.O.D. That service lets viewers rent or purchase movies at a lower price after 90 days in theaters. She said the premium offering was "an additive, important new revenue source that didn't exist three years ago."
In other words, Universal thinks that, to some degree, it has found an entirely new customer.
"It has had a hugely positive impact on our business," Ms. Langley said, adding that without it, Universal would have likely had to make fewer movies. Universal and Focus will release 26 movies in theaters this year, more than any other Hollywood studio.
Universal charges as much as $ 25 to rent a film for 48 hours and $ 30 to buy it during its premium V.O.D. sales period. Those prices can drop to $ 6 and $ 20 in the later, traditional sales window.
About 80 percent of premium V.O.D. revenue goes to Universal, with sales platforms like iTunes and Google Play keeping most of the rest. (A small cut goes to theater chains like AMC Entertainment -- grease to get them to agree to reduced exclusivity.) Ticket sales are typically split 50-50 with theaters.
Premium V.O.D. revenue is small compared with box-office sales. But it's certainly not nothing.
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie" has generated more than $ 75 million in premium V.O.D. revenue since May 16, Universal said. "Jurassic World: Dominion," "The Croods: A New Age" and "Sing 2" each collected more than $ 50 million. Universal said 14 films, including "News of the World," a period drama starring Tom Hanks, and "M3gan," each had more than $ 25 million.
Films from Focus, including "Belfast" and "Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris," have generated roughly $ 5 million each. For some art films, a theatrical release has become valuable mostly as "a marketing tool" for premium V.O.D. rentals and purchases, according to Julia Alexander, the director of strategy at Parrot Analytics, a research firm.
Much like DVD sales in the 1990s and 2000s, premium V.O.D. has started to provide a type of financial safety net on box-office misses. "The Focus titles, in particular," said Peter Levinsohn, the Universal Filmed Entertainment Group's chief distribution officer. "Those smaller films aimed at older moviegoers have become, I wouldn't say reliant on it, but they have benefited hugely."
It's also about flexibility, Mr. Levinsohn said. The studio often decides that 17 days (three weekends) of theatrical exclusivity is enough. Sometimes, based on ticket sales, it allows for longer. "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" played exclusively in theaters for 41 days.
"We have also taken back control of the decision of when to make our content available in the home, based on the most optimal timing for an individual film," Mr. Levinsohn said. NBCUniversal said in January that revenue from its studios (both film and TV) increased 23 percent in 2022 from a year earlier, to $ 11.6 billion.
Every studio has been trying to find creative ways to maximize movie profits in a fast-changing business. Part of Universal's challenge is guessing what kind of impact premium V.O.D. might have on streaming: If movies are sold or rented more widely before they arrive on a streaming service (in Universal's case, on Peacock and Netflix), does that make the movies less valuable tools for encouraging people to sign up for streaming services?
"The impact on streaming is not quite as big as people might have expected, but it's still notable," Ms. Alexander said.

For a Better Workout, Try Tricking Your Brain: [Science Desk]

Full text: Sometimes getting on the bike or hitting the pavement is more a mental game than a physical one.
We all know exercise is good for us, but its benefits don't always motivate us to set an alarm and lace up our running shoes. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 75 percent of Americans don't meet the recommended guidelines for aerobic and strengthening exercise.
Many experts say the key to better and more regular workouts is not in the body, but in the mind. As anyone deciding between a Netflix binge and an evening run can understand, the body may be willing, but the spirit occasionally needs a kick start.
However, there are a few tools that can trick our reluctant brains into finding the motivation to head back to the gym or set out on that bike trail.
Game it up.
The brain loves a game, especially if it's hard to predict or offers intermittent rewards, said Daya Grant, a neuroscientist and a mental performance coach in Los Angeles. Use that to your advantage.
For example, Milo Bryant, a performance coach in San Diego, uses an exercise grab bag for his group classes. "They'll draw an exercise from one bag and a rep count from the other and whatever comes up, that's what they do," he said.
Apps like Zombies, Run! -- a cross between a fitness tracker and an episode of "The Last of Us" -- take this to a new level. Like most running apps, it allows you to track your route and pace. The twist is how it pipes "missions" through your headphones as you run, directing you to sprint to avoid a zombie or to pick up supplies to build a virtual shelter.
The app Rouvy connects to a smart trainer, which converts your regular bike into a stationary one, for a virtual ride through different city streets around the world. It can even tweak your bike's resistance as you encounter dips and hills. Pam Moore, a cycling instructor in Boulder, Colo., said she once biked through Beverly Hills with a friend in Portland, Ore., without leaving home.
"Although she was ahead of me, we could still ride together," Ms. Moore said.
Tailor it to fit.
Our brain also loves things that seem tailored for us. In a recent study, athletes who believed they had received a customized workout plan outperformed those who thought they were following a generic one.
Personal trainers are a natural way to make use of this perception. Or you can use an app like Stronger by the Day, in which trainers take your fitness stats (the heaviest load you can lift, for example) and produce a strength-training program adapted for you.
"I'm obsessed with it," Ms. Moore said. "By simply showing up and doing what it said, I've gotten so much stronger."
According to Panteleimon Ekkekakis, an exercise psychologist at Michigan State University, we tend to remember experiences by how we feel at the end of them. That's why he suggests "flipping the order of exercise -- doing the hardest part early on after a good warm-up and gradually reducing the intensity -- so you leave the session with the best possible memory." This reverse-slope approach not only increases enjoyment just after a workout, but also improves how we perceive exercise up to a week later.
Work like a (Pavlovian) dog.
Habits can become hard-wired into the brain. So hitch your fitness to an "anchor habit," something you already do every day, said Ben Reale, a personal trainer in Atlanta. If you drop off your children at school at 8 a.m., for example, be in the weight room by 8:15 a.m.
"Like the Pavlovian response, when we stack these habits together consistently over several weeks, we take the decision point, the willpower, out of the equation," Mr. Reale said.
More reluctant exercisers might need a little something extra. Try pairing your workout with an activity you love, like catching up on the latest season of "The Bachelor." This "temptation bundling" is amplified if you only do the desired activity when you're exercising, said Katy Milkman, a behavioral scientist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
"So you're only indulging in your lowbrow TV or listening to your vampire novels at the gym," Dr. Milkman said.
Make an emotional commitment.
The most effective psychological trick to building an exercise habit might also be the simplest: Sign up for something -- whether it's a 5K in three months, a tennis tournament in a year or a father-daughter dance next spring.
"When we're training for something, it gives every workout purpose," Mr. Bryant said. Set up smaller goals along the way, making sure they're challenging but achievable.
Above all, figure out what works best for you -- keeping in mind what that means may change. Exercise is more sustainable if we have an emotional connection to it.
"It's why some people run marathons for causes or dedicate each mile to a specific person," Dr. Grant said.

Longtime Target of the Tabloids Is Getting His Day in Court: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The prince is getting his day in court as he takes on the tabloids that scrutinized his every move for years, even hacking his phone.
When Prince Harry takes the stand in a phone-hacking case on Tuesday, it will mark another milestone in his singular journey: He will be the first senior royal to testify in court since 1891, when the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII, testified in the case of a man accused of cheating at a game of baccarat.
Yet for Harry, the court appearance is, in many ways, just another chapter in what has become a life of litigation.
Harry and his wife, Meghan, are plaintiffs in no fewer than seven cases against the British tabloids and other media organizations for phone hacking and other violations of their privacy. Harry has also filed two claims against Britain's Home Office related to the loss of his police protection during trips to his home country.
As the cases grind through the legal system, Harry's visits are now as likely to be tied to courtroom dates as to royal ceremonies like the coronation of his father, King Charles III, which he attended last month. On Monday, Harry arrived from Los Angeles to testify in a lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers, which he accused of hacking his cellphone more than a decade ago.
Before the coronation, the last time he came was in March to appear in court, alongside the pop star Elton John, in a case against the publisher of the Daily Mail on charges of tapping his cellphone. He is also suing Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers for hacking and other privacy violations.
For Harry, who now largely supports himself, the litigation has been expensive and time-consuming. People who know him say he did not expect, when he brought the suits, that they would drag on for so many years. Going to war against the tabloids has not helped his image in Britain, where his popularity has already been tarnished by his bitter split with his father and older brother, William.
But the court appearances do give him a platform to press what he has cast as one of his life's missions: Curbing the excesses of the tabloids, which he and Meghan have accused of upending people's lives "for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue."
"He is taking action over alleged illegality, alleged abuse of power," said Peter Hunt, a former royal correspondent for the BBC. "That is quite a courageous move, which is not an adjective often seen next to the name Harry."
The prince's campaign against the tabloids sets him apart from other members of the royal family, who have tried to accommodate the papers. On Monday, as the trial opened, the front page of The Sun carried a flattering photo of William's wife, Princess Catherine, above a headline that said, "I'm proud to back Sun appeal," referring to a charity campaign sponsored by the newspaper.
Since Harry left Britain in 2020, he has gone a long way toward taking back control of his narrative from the tabloids. Between his tell-all memoir, "Spare," and a Netflix documentary with Meghan, Harry will have little new information to disclose on the stand, Mr. Hunt predicted.
Instead, Harry is expected to describe a pattern of hacking that led to prison terms for multiple journalists; precipitated the closing of Mr. Murdoch's News of the World tabloid; set off a major public investigation, the Leveson Inquiry; and resulted in voluntary restrictions on the papers.
On Monday, Harry's lawyer, David Sherborne, began laying out the details. The Mirror Group, he said, intercepted the prince's voice mail messages, paid private investigators to gather information about him, and employed photographers who used unlawful means to track the whereabouts of Harry and those close to him, including his former girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, whose cellphone was also hacked.
To illustrate their case, Harry's lawyers submitted 147 articles that it said were based on information obtained using illegal means. These covered a stretch from his childhood through his school years and the years following the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 after being pursued by photographers.
"Every facet of his life was splashed across the paper as an exclusive, a story too good not to publish," Mr. Sherborne said. "Nothing was sacrosanct or out of bounds, and there was no protection from these unlawful information gathering methods."
Many of the journalists who used those methods are still employed by The Mirror, and some have risen to positions of authority in the company, Mr. Sherborne said. "The notion that this took place years ago is misplaced," he said.
Still, that is the nub of the case made by the Mirror Group's lawyers. Because the bulk of this activity took place between 1991 and 2011, the lawyers said in a filing, it lies well beyond the six-year time limitation that generally applies to legal complaints of privacy violations. The practice of phone hacking has all but vanished since the scandal erupted in 2011, according to lawyers who specialize in these cases.
Lawyers for Harry and three other plaintiffs in the case counter that the company concealed its illegal activity from them, so they could not reasonably have been expected to discover it sooner. In addition to Harry, the others are Nikki Sanderson and Michael Taylor, who both appeared in the popular TV series "Coronation Street," and Fiona Wightman, the former wife of a well-known comedian, Paul Whitehouse.
Daniel Taylor, a lawyer whose firm, Taylor Hampton, represents Ms. Wightman, said it was extraordinary that the trial was going ahead at all. It is only the second such case to go to trial after dozens of cases, and more than decade of hacking-related litigation, he said, and it poses risks to both sides.
Harry, he said, "is likely to be subjected to rigorous and sustained cross-examination" by lawyers representing Mirror Group. That could prove embarrassing, given that the hacking took place during the years before Harry met his wife, Meghan, when he was single and involved in sometimes turbulent relationships.
But the Mirror Group is also taking a risk in going to trial, Mr. Taylor said, since a defeat could encourage other victims of hacking to come forward. "It is willing to do so because a win or partial success at trial will, in its view, slow or stop the oncoming tide of claims being brought against the company," he said.
On Monday, Harry managed to irritate the judge, Timothy Fancourt, by not showing up for the trial as expected. Mr. Sherborne explained that he had stayed in California on Sunday to celebrate the second birthday of his daughter, Lilibet, and would be in court to testify on Tuesday and Wednesday. A lawyer for the Mirror Group expressed concern that he would not get a full day and a half for cross-examination.
Some royal watchers said it was a sign of Harry's polarizing reputation in Britain that the media coverage before the trial focused on whether testifying would diminish his stature rather than on the journalism issues at stake.
"The kernel of what he's trying to do is being watered down," said Mr. Hunt, the former BBC correspondent. "It's almost as if phone hacking is priced in," he said, adding, "it wasn't priced in if you were the victim."

Persuading Gamers To Slay Monsters In Hell, Forever: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: An addictive formula -- kill enemies and collect the powerful gear they drop -- is back, this time in a transformed video game industry where players now expect free content updates.
With hits like World of Warcraft and Diablo, Blizzard Entertainment is considered a progenitor of the "forever game," addictive experiences that players cannot put down because they seemingly never run out of quests to complete or gear to collect.
Part of Diablo's deviousness was that it took forever to get what you wanted. As players fought through dungeons, slain monsters dropped loot, such as weapons and jewelry, that would empower their characters. Sometimes they were randomly rewarded with rare and exceedingly potent loot, much like pulling a slot machine and hitting the jackpot.
The endless dopamine-inducing hunt was a winning formula that persuaded Diablo players over the past 26 years to invest hundreds, sometimes thousands, of hours into building the perfect character. But as the studio, now part of Activision Blizzard, prepares to release Diablo IV for computers and Xbox and PlayStation consoles on Tuesday, it is modifying its casino-like tactics to build a forever game for modern times.
The industry has transformed since Diablo III was released more than a decade ago. Diablo IV will now face an array of online competitors, not just other formidable forever games like Destiny and Fortnite, but also streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ that are battling to monopolize people's time.
"Games have become more of a hobby or a lifestyle," said Rod Fergusson, the Blizzard executive producer overseeing Diablo IV. "That does mean that you have to think about it as this live service."
The old-school video game model, which Blizzard still uses for World of Warcraft, asked those who wanted additional gameplay to pay for expansion packs known as DLC, for downloadable content. But players now expect regular updates for free, with publishers instead making money from the sale of cosmetic upgrades to an engaged fan base.
Taking cues from modern forever games, Blizzard plans to release quarterly updates to Diablo IV that introduce new quests, story lines, items and gameplay mechanics. People who engage each season can unlock in-game rewards through battle passes, an industrywide tactic for player retention.
Facing the increased demands for additional content, Blizzard is emphasizing the storytelling that in past Diablo games was treated like an afterthought. Diablo IV returns to a dark, heavy metal aesthetic and centers on the antagonist Lilith, the daughter of the Lord of Hatred, who has been resurrected by cultists; player-controlled sorcerers, barbarians, rogues, necromancers and druids will pursue her as she wreaks havoc.
In a first for the franchise, Blizzard said, each player's unique character will be rendered in real time to appear inside the cinematic sequences intended to make Diablo IV's story more immersive. And although defeated foes will continue to litter rare items at random, there will now be dungeons and quests where specific pieces of gear, like a special pair of boots or a dagger, can be found.
"Valuing people's time and their experience -- they don't want to feel like they're in a fight with the game," Fergusson said. "Players have come to expect to have some control over the situation."
There is no guarantee that longtime Diablo fans will appreciate the changes. Diablo III featured a virtual auction house where players could buy and sell gear with real money, but Blizzard shut down the store after concluding that it "ultimately undermines Diablo's core gameplay: kill monsters to get cool loot."
Major game studios pour resources into their biggest games, and Fergusson said the Diablo IV team, composed of hundreds of employees, was roughly double that behind the game's predecessor. One group is focusing on the main story while two others are working on parallel tracks for season updates; another works on player customizations, such as the character outfits that are a key part of the game's long-term plan to make money.
Gamers who have immersed themselves in franchises like League of Legends or Apex Legends will be familiar with the approach Blizzard is taking with Diablo IV.
The studio said each quarterly update would showcase fresh story lines, including quests featuring old and new characters, and concepts that shift the dynamics of how the game was played. Players who complete certain tasks will be able to unlock perks, including currency that can be used to buy cosmetic upgrades; though anyone can play on a free tier of the battle pass, those who spend $ 10 a month get access to a more exclusive set of premium outfits.
Jose Zagal, a professor who teaches courses on video game design at the University of Utah, said the forever game model was beneficial for workers, who experience more job stability when projects are extended years beyond their release date.
Yet he had mixed feelings about the implications for players. While they can get more hours of entertainment per dollar from forever games, he said, they are all essentially the same soap opera.
"Imagine you only watch one TV show and it was the only thing you watched," Zagal said. "That is a bit of an unintended consequence of this shift toward really focusing hard on making the game work like a hobby. Are you getting interesting new gameplay experiences?"
Blizzard features different revenue models for its games -- while Hearthstone and Overwatch 2 are both free to play with optional microtransactions, World of Warcraft requires a monthly subscription. Diablo IV is trying to reap the benefits of multiple models by charging $ 70 for the game while also accumulating revenue from the players who buy cosmetic upgrades.
Fans of other games have been happy to shell out cash for the outfits known as skins, said Lewis Ward, an analyst who studies the gaming industry for IDC, the research firm. "It's an ego thing," he said. "It's basically a way to insert your own expression into the game environment."
Zagal added that Diablo IV's approach would allow Blizzard to extract revenue from different groups of players; longtime fans who are now parents might only have time to play through the game once, while players with fewer constraints could commit to playing the game in perpetuity.
Although previous Diablo games were fairly linear, Diablo IV embraces the popular open-world format where players can freely explore their environment and complete optional tasks at their leisure before resuming the main story.
The loose open-world structure also enables incentives for gamers to keep coming back for more. Each day, timed events will trigger at a random hour and location in Diablo IV, at which point up to 12 players can congregate to fight a boss together and earn special loot.
By making a modern forever game, Blizzard's staff has committed to producing Diablo IV for eternity (or at least for as long as enough people are playing it). Fergusson said the effort was worthwhile because although gamers now have unfettered access to digital content, they tend to talk about the one game they played all year, not the new game they played each month.
"You definitely have to have a team," he said, "that can respond to that consumptive nature of players to say, 'Hey, you want a new experience in this existing game? How do I keep giving that to you?"'

Air Travel Could Become Even More Miserable: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Were you planning on a last-minute trip to Orlando to visit Gov. Ron DeSantis's favorite amusement park? "Prices are currently high for your search," warns Google Flights. Well, yes they are.
And yes, fares have been high throughout our last two years of "revenge travel" mode. Packed jets, ill-tempered passengers, bad airline management and weather roulette contributed to some miserable travel conditions last year, when more than 180,000 flights were canceled, according to Department of Transportation data. While the Federal Aviation Administration is corralling tantrum throwing grown-ups, there's not much the agency can do about climate change-induced weather events.
The industry is also struggling with staffing shortages that have contributed to domestic airline capacity, relative to the economy, remaining below prepandemic levels. This summer, when our overheating climate starts spinning thunderstorms and hurricanes around the country, we could be back to business as miserable.
Against this backdrop of diminishing expectations, JetBlue Airways stood out. The carrier's first flight took off in 2000 from busy, brusque Kennedy Airport and actually delivered on the promise of a better in-flight experience -- bigger coach seats, more palatable food, free satellite television and pricing that got competitors' attention. JetBlue's history as a lower-priced disrupter is so well known it's called "the JetBlue Effect." The mere threat of JetBlue sniffing new turf is enough to keep the major players in check.
But now JetBlue wants to be a major player, too. It formed the Northeast Alliance with American Airlines in 2021 and, a year later, announced its planned acquisition of ultra low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines. At a time when four airlines and their tightly coupled networks control 80 percent of the domestic traffic, the U.S. government is fighting both deals. Last month, a federal judge ordered JetBlue and American to disentangle the Northeast Alliance. American said it would appeal.
As a journalist who has covered big mergers and airline operations, I'm taking the government's side in this fight. If JetBlue is allowed to grow as big as it wants, market forces figure to make the JetBlue Effect evaporate like a vapor trail from one of its jets.
In other parts of the travel and hospitality industry, innovation is a driving force. Hyatt Hotels, for instance, just started a concept called Hyatt Studios, for extended-stay guests, that is the latest of the more than two dozen brands in the company's portfolio. Innovation in airlines, however, is rarer than reward seats during the holiday season. While most goods and services improve over decades, air travel has defied progress -- with the very important exception of safety. Innovative airline start-ups are relatively rare. One of the most recent is Breeze Airways, founded by David Neeleman -- who also founded JetBlue.
Why don't airlines innovate? Part of the answer is that they are in a capital-intense business and are largely driven by chief financial officers, while hotel management companies are asset-light and are driven by customer service managers. The former asks: How much more money can I squeeze out of this very expensive piece of equipment? The latter asks: How can I improve the customer experience and get paid for it? Which is why the experience of arriving at your hotel is so much better than the experience of flying to your destination.
The operating structure of the industry has also made innovation difficult, particularly post-pandemic. When JetBlue started, it attracted thousands of résumés from pilots. Today, the carriers are short thousands of pilots and other professionals. Likewise, there were takeoff and landing slots available at J.F.K. in 2000. Today, the four major carriers control most of these precious slots in major airports and aren't keen to surrender them. Want new jets? The production wait can be years long.
Nor is the industry vulnerable to outsiders. Transportation disrupters such as Uber and Lime made a strategy out of flouting local regulations and asking for permission later. That's not an option in air travel: You can't show up at LaGuardia with a jet and declare yourself open for business.
Since the arrival of ultra low-cost carriers like Spirit, innovation has come mostly in the form of pricing. By unbundling each part of the journey and then tacking on fees -- for an assigned seat, for stowing your luggage, for the overhead bin, for getting a printed ticket, for early boarding -- average airfares have fallen. That has helped make it possible for many more people to share in the pain of flying.
Logically, as passengers, we'd want more of what JetBlue brought to the business. Its chief executive, Robin Hayes, has promised as much, arguing that a JetBlue-Spirit combination equals more comfort and better services, value priced. "This is the anti-merger merger," he said in a meeting with Times Opinion in March. He maintains that the combined carriers, which represent about 9 percent of the domestic market, will be able to form a more muscular network that could better take on Delta, Southwest, United and its likely soon-to-be-former partner American.
The Department of Justice is positing that a post-merger JetBlue can't be the same innovative company it claims it will be. JetBlue can't imagine not being that same company. But when companies scale, or start making big acquisitions, they can't necessarily bring their cultures with them, whatever they want to believe. We once thought Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google were cool. Then they became FAANG, an acronym that connotes Big Tech.
The more prosaic view, though, is that JetBlue is buying assets to bulk up. Spirit has roughly 190 Airbus A320 family jets and, just as important, the pilots to fly them. That will allow JetBlue to grow faster than it could organically, if at a high cost. Spirit will most likely disappear in a couple of years, which a cynic might note is not necessarily a bad thing, given its on-time record.
A bigger JetBlue figures to have less reason to innovate because it will have greater pressure to protect its newly expanded turf. Airline mergers inevitably create fortress hubs -- United's combination with Continental erected one in Newark. And JetBlue's Northeast Alliance with American has already congealed into fortress hubs at J.F.K., LaGuardia and Boston Logan, the Justice Department charged. Fortress hubs result in higher fares. Once in a position of market power, why would JetBlue, or any company, charge less than it can get people to pay?
Wall Street is forever urging capacity discipline to protect profitability. Consider, too, that JetBlue took on debt to finance the $ 3.38 billion all-cash purchase of Spirit. Which is to say that JetBlue will face considerable obstacles to remain true blue to its disruptive culture.
Given the industry's past success in mergers, JetBlue's chances of capturing Spirit are still good. But a bigger JetBlue would make the carrier a bigger barrier for the creation of a future JetBlue-like airline. That would be unfortunate.
In the postwar jet age era, industry pioneers such as Pan Am's Juan Trippe, who introduced both the 707 and the 747 into service, knew that the sky was the limit. In the current era, Mr. Trippe might have discovered that the sky is very limited. The JetBlue-Spirit merger would only make it more so.

Full text: The "Cruel Summer" actor explains why Frank Ocean, ramen and "MJ: The Musical" are among her favorite things.
As she was learning the part of Isabella, who she plays on the teen drama "Cruel Summer," Lexi Underwood asked herself, "What would Pearl do?"
Pearl is one of her previous television roles, from the 2020 Hulu mini-series "Little Fires Everywhere."
That character, constantly uprooted by her enigmatic mother, has some similarities with Isabella, the daughter of peripatetic diplomats. Both have complicated relationships with their parents. Both crave stability and normal lives, suppressing their pain while pretending that everything is fine.
"I felt as though I was able to pull some of the things that I learned along the way of playing Pearl and bring that to Isabella," Underwood, 19, said in a video call. "It was like if Pearl was a little bit older and we got to see her living that type of life. I feel like maybe that's the path that she would've gone down." ("Cruel Summer" begins its second season on Freeform on June 5.)
Underwood played Young Nala in "The Lion King" on Broadway when she was 11, and soon after persuaded her parents to let her visit Los Angeles for pilot season. She never left, and by 15 had started her own production company to tell the stories that were often overlooked.
"I wanted to take matters into my own hands," Underwood said before talking about meditation, Frank Ocean and the Netflix animated series "The Midnight Gospel." "Any person that's ever felt as though they haven't been heard or were misrepresented, I want to make them feel seen."
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
'The Four Agreements'
Every person should read this book at least once in their life. Because every agreement has multiple lessons that help us break down the parts of ourselves or our conditioning that no longer serve us as human beings, and that keep us from being free thinkers.
'BoJack Horseman'
I don't know if I've ever related to a show more. I am a young actor in Hollywood, and I was a child actor, so I know what it's like to go on that journey of being 10 or 11 in the industry, and then being a teenager, and then transitioning into your 20s, and all the ups and downs that go with that. I've never seen the ebb and flow of the industry, and how it affects your mental health as well, depicted in such an authentic way outside of "BoJack Horseman."
Meditation
The way that you start a day and the way that you end a day is super important. Instead of reaching for my phone as soon as I wake up, I'm going straight to my meditation corner and thinking about the things that I'm grateful for and the energy that I want to bring into my day. And before you go to sleep, I think that it's important to be able to have that quiet time with your body and with your mind and allow your soul to be at peace for a second.
Crystals
I carry them with me all the time -- literally have one right here. It's a rose quartz. It's good energy, love and happiness. I genuinely believe that they help you tap into a certain frequency. And certain crystals can help protect you, so if you're out and somebody's not necessarily being kind, carrying that crystal on you may help them not want to be in your personal space.
My Grandma's House in North Carolina
That is my safe haven. It always has been ever since I was younger, even before I moved to L.A. It's the house that my grandmother grew up in, it's the house that my mom grew up in. And it's the house where we have all of our family gatherings. I'm grateful that I have that place to be able to go back to whenever I feel as though I just need a break.
'The Midnight Gospel'
I've been so into animated series lately. This one is tied to spirituality. The character's name is Clancy, and it's kind of like them in the afterlife, going back on Earth to help people understand the true meaning of life -- because they know what's really happening behind the scenes and in the universe. It's about grief, it's about forgiveness, it's about healing, it's about family and your relationship with your mom and cherishing our loved ones before it's too late.
'MJ: The Musical' on Broadway
I've seen it three times so far. And it is just so stinking good. My favorite artist growing up, outside of Aaliyah, was Michael Jackson. Fun fact: We're a day apart, our birthdays, so I used to say that we're almost birthday twins. I admire him so much. His dedication, his motivation, the way he approached his craft. Being able to see his story told in that light on Broadway -- I was so moved, and I keep going back and bringing people.
'Blonde'
Frank Ocean has always had a huge impact on me, and "Blonde" specifically. That album, for me, symbolizes everything that it means to come of age -- the heartbreak, the finding yourself. I've had a lot of beautiful moments while listening to those songs. That album is a classic and I still listen it at least three times a month.
'Homecoming'
During quarantine when I was feeling so low, and I was like, "Am I never going to work again?" I distracted myself with watching "Homecoming" to make myself feel motivated and be like, "Oh yeah, everything is going to work out." Any time that I have to get ready for press or pump myself up to get in a good mood, I play Beyoncé.
Ramen
Whenever I feel down, I get ramen. There's a ramen spot that's five minutes from my house that I honestly abuse the heck out of because I'm always over there. I feel like my friends are probably tired of me constantly suggesting to go get ramen when they ask what we want for lunch. But they'll be fine.

The White House's Debt-Ceiling Strategy Was to Win in the Fine Print: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The president and his negotiators believe they worked out a deal that allowed Republicans to claim big spending cuts even as the reality was far more modest.
Shalanda Young couldn't sleep.
A small team of Biden administration officials had spent the past two days in intense negotiations with House Republicans in an attempt to avert a catastrophic government default. Ms. Young, the White House budget director, had been trading proposals on federal spending caps with negotiators deputized by Speaker Kevin McCarthy, whose Republican caucus was refusing to raise the nation's $ 31.4 trillion borrowing limit without deep cuts.
Now, as she scrolled Netflix in search of "bad television" to distract her racing mind, Ms. Young had a sinking feeling. What if she cut a deal to reduce spending and raise the debt limit, only to see Republicans attempt to force through much deeper cuts when it came time to pass annual appropriations bills this fall?
At work the next morning, Ms. Young asked her staff how to stop that from happening. They settled on a plan, which in essence would penalize Republicans' most cherished spending programs if they failed to follow the contours of the agreement. Then they forced Republicans to include that plan in the legislative text codifying the deal.
That approach reflected a broader strategy President Biden's team followed in the debt limit negotiations, according to interviews with current and former administration officials, some Republicans and other people familiar with the talks.
On Saturday, that strategy reached its conclusion as Mr. Biden signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 into law, just days before a potential default and following weeks of talks and a revolt from right-wing lawmakers in the House that put an agreement at risk of collapse.
In pursuit of an agreement, the Biden team was willing to give Republicans victory after victory on political talking points, which they realized Mr. McCarthy needed to sell the bill to his conference. They let Mr. McCarthy's team claim in the end that the deal included deep spending cuts, huge clawbacks of unspent federal coronavirus relief money and stringent work requirements for recipients of federal aid.
But in the details of the text and the many side deals that accompanied it, the Biden team wanted to win on substance. With one large exception -- a $ 20 billion cut in enforcement funding for the Internal Revenue Service -- they believe they did.
The way administration officials see it, the full final agreement's spending cuts are nothing worse than they would have expected in regular appropriations bills passed by a divided Congress. They agreed to structure the cuts so they appeared to save $ 1.5 trillion over a decade in the eyes of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But thanks to the side deals -- including some accounting tricks -- White House officials estimate that the actual cuts could total as little as $ 136 billion over the two enforceable years of the spending caps that are central to the agreement.
Much of the $ 30 billion in clawed-back Covid-19 money was probably never going to be spent, Biden officials say, including dollars from an aviation manufacturing jobs program that had basically ended.
At one point in the talks, administration officials offered to include in the deal more than 100 relief programs from which they were willing to rescind money. The final list spanned 20 pages of a 99-page bill, and Mr. McCarthy championed it on the House floor. But because much of the money was repurposed for other spending, the net savings added up to only about $ 11 billion over two years. One of the programs had a remaining balance of just $ 40.
Many Democrats remain furious that the deal included new work requirements that could push 750,000 people off food stamps, which the Biden team begrudgingly concluded it had to accept.
That measure alone could have tanked Democratic support for the deal in Congress, officials knew. So they sought to counterbalance it with efforts to expand food stamp eligibility for veterans, the homeless and others, which Republicans agreed to do. The budget office concluded that the changes would actually add recipients to the program, on net.
Some Democrats and progressive groups have sharply criticized Mr. Biden for negotiating over the debt limit at all, denouncing the spending cuts and work requirements and saying he cemented Republicans' ability to ransom the borrowing limit whenever a Democrat occupies the White House.
Republican negotiators sold the deal as a game-changing blow to Mr. Biden's spending ambitions. "They absolutely have tire tracks on them in this negotiation," Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana said before the House vote on Wednesday.
Mr. Biden views it differently. As the Senate prepared to pass the agreement on Thursday evening, he huddled with his chief of staff, Jeffrey D. Zients, along with Steve Ricchetti, counselor to the president, and other aides, in Mr. Zients's office in the West Wing of the White House. Mr. Biden asked them what you might call a scorecard question: What percentage of Democrats in the House had voted for the deal, and what share were expected to in the Senate?
When Mr. Ricchetti told him the number of Democrats would be larger, in both chambers, than the share of Republicans supporting the deal, Mr. Biden was pleased. It was validation, in his view, that he had cut a good deal.
Mr. Zients referred to that vote share in an interview on Friday. "If you go back a few months ago, no one would have thought this was possible," he said.
It was not an assured outcome. The negotiating teams came to the table with divergent views of the drivers of federal debt in recent years. White House negotiators blamed Republican tax cuts. Republicans blamed Mr. Biden's economic agenda, including a debt-financed Covid relief bill in 2021 and a bipartisan infrastructure bill later that year.
The dispute occasionally grew profane. At one point, after Mr. Biden's negotiators criticized the 2017 Republican tax cuts, a "very mild-mannered" aide to Mr. McCarthy stood up, shook his finger at the Biden team and hotly responded that their argument was nonsense, using a vulgarity, Mr. Graves recounted.
Mr. Biden had insisted for months that he would not negotiate over raising the borrowing limit. But privately, many aides had been planning on talks all along -- though they refused to admit those talks were linked to the debt limit. The Biden team reasoned that it would have to negotiate fiscal issues this year anyway, both on appropriations bills and on programs like food stamps that are included in a regularly reauthorized farm bill.
Mr. Biden's economic advisers, including Lael Brainard, the director of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, were warning of catastrophic damage to the economy if the government could no longer pay its bills on time.
The president appeared to score wins before the talks even started. He goaded Republicans into agreeing, in the midst of his State of the Union address, that Social Security and Medicare would be off limits in the talks -- thanks to a spontaneous riff that grew out of a passage in his speech that he had worked on extensively in the days beforehand. He proposed a budget filled with tax increases on the rich and corporations that were meant to reduce debt, but he refused to engage Mr. McCarthy in serious talks until Republicans offered a spending plan of their own.
In late April, the House passed a bill that included $ 4.7 trillion in savings from spending cuts, canceling clean-energy tax breaks and clawing back money for Covid relief and the I.R.S. It featured work requirements and measures to speed fossil fuel projects, and it raised the debt limit for one year.
Mr. Biden, under fire from business groups and others who feared the standoff could result in the United States running out of money before the debt limit was raised, soon agreed to designate a team of negotiators. The White House team was led by officials including Ms. Young and one of her top aides, Michael Linden, who delayed his departure from the White House to help negotiate along with Louisa Terrell, the legislative affairs director, and Mr. Ricchetti.
Mr. McCarthy's negotiators gave Biden officials the impression that to reach agreement, they needed at least one talking point from every major aspect of the House Republican debt limit bill.
The talks took a few surprising turns. Multiple White House officials say the Republican team briefly entertained relatively modest proposals to raise tax revenue, including closing loopholes that benefit some real-estate owners and people who trade cryptocurrency. Those discussions stalled quickly.
Democrats agreed to fast-track a natural gas pipeline, in what officials concede was making good on a promise to Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, for backing Mr. Biden's signature climate law last year.
The spending caps ended up roughly where many Biden aides had predicted they would in private discussions months ago. But few White House officials believed they would have to give up $ 20 billion of the $ 80 billion that Democrats approved last year to help the I.R.S. crack down on tax cheats. Mr. Biden hammered out the amount in a final call with Mr. McCarthy.
Ms. Young said that cut was painful. "And not just for me," she added. "It's something we talked to the president about many times. He cares deeply about this."
On Thursday evening in Mr. Zients's office, the president and his team were focused on upsides. They had beaten back Republican attempts to cancel the climate law, to add new work requirements on Medicaid recipients and to impose binding spending caps for a decade. Mr. Biden was particularly pleased to spare key veterans' programs from cuts.
On Friday morning, Mr. Zients gathered core officials in his office, as he had every day, seven days a week, for several weeks running. Ms. Brainard and the economic team were relieved to have cleared the threat of default not just for this year, but through the next presidential election. Aides worked on honing Mr. Biden's planned remarks in an Oval Office address on Friday evening.
The speech started at 7:01 p.m., unusually promptly for Mr. Biden. By then, his staff was already celebrating. An hour earlier, happy hour had begun in Mr. Zients's office.

What Are You Calling Your Summer?: [Style Desk]

Full text: Barefoot-Boy Summer? Side Chick Summer? It's officially the season of out-there predictions for the summer ahead.
As trees open their blooms, the predictions come on like an allergy attack.
The song of the summer will be by Ed Sheeran. The drink of the summer will be the Hugo Spritz. Feral Girl Summer is over and Married Girl Summer has arrived. Get out your toenail clippers, because Barefoot-Boy Summer is on its way.
Summer is coming, and with it the yearly onslaught of attempts to label a season that has not yet happened. Media outlets one-up one another's outrageous guesses, and influencers compose mood boards for their followers to emulate. Themes pile up on social media, where almost no activity is safe from being named a seasonal microtrend. Just lounging outdoors in a lightweight dress? Welcome to your Amy March Girl Summer.
Many of these declarations are not meant to be taken seriously, and plenty will not succeed (see: Hot Vax Summer and, less consequentially, The New York Times's endorsement of the Dirty Shirley). But all arise from a desire to identify some distinct flavor of each summer that can be captured and stored like strawberry preserves.
"No summer ever came back, and no two summers ever were alike," wrote Nathaniel Hawthorne, who died 155 years before he would have been able to listen to Megan Thee Stallion's "Hot Girl Summer."
Winter always gets to be winter. The pumpkin spice latte is barely tweaked from one fall to the next. So why do we subject summer to this premature, and perhaps futile, exercise in branding?
Adjective, Noun, Season
For one, there's the tantalizing possibility of getting it right.
"I don't think you could think about summer without thinking about 'Hot Girl Summer,"' Megan Thee Stallion told The Times Magazine in 2020. The rapper, who had released the song in August 2019, conveyed a message of self-assurance with flaming album art and a kinetic beat.
The song captured, and perhaps influenced, the feeling of the late days of that summer, said Charlie Harding, a host of the music podcast "Switched on Pop." "So many people took up that moniker of feeling hot and feeling good," he said.
Its title was a handy three-word Mad Lib -- adjective, noun, season -- that almost anyone could use to outline goals for the season.
The phrase was used to express hope for a Hot Vax Summer of swab-free debauchery in 2021. Meghan Markle was having a Single Girl Summer when she met Prince Harry, according to their Netflix documentary. The meme even expanded its seasonal footprint into Christian Girl Autumn and Short King Spring.
E.E. Holmes, 41, a writer in central Massachusetts, sees versions of the phrase roll across her Twitter feed every May. In 2021, she scrolled past posts about Hobbit Girl Summer (living in a shire, eating potatoes) and "Gone Girl" Summer (disappearing mysteriously).
Ms. Holmes added her own to the canon: "Golden Girls" Summer. "I'm thinking, the chilling and the cheesecake and the girlfriends and drinks on the lanai," she said. "I don't want to have to shave too much."
'The Apex of Living'
Making such predictions may be a way of dealing with the immense expectations of the season.
Beginning in childhood, Americans look forward to summers off from school, from which they might return with bangs or new boyfriends. The season is often the backdrop of coming-of-age stories, from Edith Wharton's "Summer" to the film "Wet Hot American Summer." It can also be a time of social upheaval, as in 1967, when nationwide riots against racial injustice coincided with San Francisco's freewheeling Summer of Love.
There is a pervasive idea that "summer is the apex of living," said Sheila Liming, an associate professor at Champlain College in Burlington, Vt., and the author of "Hanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time." It is a season of exposure, especially in the Northeast, where warmer weather and more hours of daylight are welcomed after a chilly winter.
"Summer is the season in which we actually live out in public," Professor Liming said.
Gazelle Mone't, 29, a stylist, said she felt more pressure to socialize in the summer. "In the winter, it's cool if you're just inside," she said. "In the summertime, it would be fun to kayak, like, not alone."
Ms. Mone't began telling people that she wanted to have a Soft Woman Summer, hoping to find others who might skip the club scene and go paint in the woods. She recently took a road trip with friends from Seattle to Joshua Tree National Park, in Southern California.
Angela Neal-Barnett, a psychology professor at Kent State University in Ohio, said that announcing a plan for the summer ahead of time was a form of visualization. "I have to commit to it, because people are going to come back and ask me, Did you do the Hot Girl Summer, or the Hot Margarita Summer, or whatever it is?" she said.
'Come On Now'
Media outlets and companies have also, unsurprisingly, taken to branding the season.
Brandy Jensen, a former deputy editor at Gawker, said she had noticed a series of absurd summer trend predictions in recent weeks. A Rolling Stone article declared 2023 the summer of the "side chick," citing Kerry from "Succession," Queen Camilla and Raquel Leviss from "Vanderpump Rules." The Cut decreed a Barefoot-Boy Summer because the actor Jacob Elordi and a member of the singer Shawn Mendes's entourage had both been spotted shoeless.
Ms. Jensen said she found both stories entertaining -- but she is not slipping off her shoes just yet. "Websites want clicks," she said, and nesting three recent pop culture moments under a "trend of the summer" label is easy but not always accurate.
"Are we really having a Barefoot-Boy Summer?" she said. "Come on now."
Brands have also tried to place their own products at the center of summer's purported theme. Spotify offers a Sad Girl Summer playlist with an image of a melting Popsicle. Wendy's tried to declare its lemonade the official drink of Hot Girl Summer in 2019.
Megan Thee Stallion has noticed. "I saw other companies were using it, and I was like, 'Thank you for your support, but I have to secure this, because this is mine,"' she said. She was awarded the trademark for Hot Girl Summer in 2022.
But if the past few weeks are any indication, the song's title may remain a blueprint for our best -- and worst -- theories about the season to come.
Cristel Antonia Russell, a professor of marketing at the Graziadio Business School at Pepperdine University, said she would not be surprised if the phrase continued to be used for years. It reminded her of "Got Milk?" -- the 1990s dairy industry advertising campaign -- in its simplicity and adaptability.
"It sounds so timeless," Professor Russell said. "Who doesn't want to be hot, and a girl, in the summer?"

To Me, the Writers' Strike Is About Respect: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Most discussion of the Hollywood writers' strike has centered on money: the studio chiefs, tech demigods and private equity oligarchs who have it and the writers like me whose labor should entitle us to a greater share of it. As a member of the Writers Guild of America, whose strike will enter its second month this week, I think that discussion is important, but it misses the real point of why workers strike and why we're willing to use the only leverage we've got -- our livelihoods -- in such a fight.
One morning back in the summer of 2002, I was walking my dog when I got a call that my father was having a heart attack. He'd been hustled to the E.R., and I was told to get there as soon as I could. They don't say that if they know the patient is going to make it.
Dad was a longtime Teamster, Local 340, which represents a grab bag of freight jockeys, municipal workers and emergency services types. As a firefighter and E.M.T., he belonged to that last group -- a mustachioed monolith and decorated combat veteran who worked and worked and, when he was done working, found some other work to do. He'd been at the fire station when he felt an unseen hand plunge into his chest and grip his heart, and he knew right away that he was in very serious trouble indeed.
By the time I arrived, doctors had succeeded in dissolving the clot that had been choking off one of his coronary arteries. I found him lying in the I.C.U., less than a quarter of his heart muscle still functioning. We didn't talk about any of that, though. He had a few things at the house he'd meant to deal with that day after his shift ended, and now he wanted me to take care of them. More alarming to me than the prospect that he could easily have died was the way his mustache was twitching nervously at the corner of his mouth. He'd come real close, and Death throwing its arm around his shoulders revealed a version of my father I hadn't thought possible: fragile, frightened, life-size and no longer a bit bigger.
His career was finished after the heart attack. Other fundamental things had changed, too. But he was alive, and the rest was just details. Besides, he'd covered his bases; he had income insurance and was eligible for early retirement with a large chunk of what his full pension would have been. The worst was over.
You know where this is going, naturally. The worst was not over.
For a man like my father, there are fates worse than death, and one of those was being treated like a deadbeat because the people who were supposed to cover him in such a circumstance refused to do so. The corporate jackals who ran the income insurance program he'd paid into for decades refused to pay out because the heart attack happened at work and, in their view, was thus properly covered by workers' compensation. At the same time, the corporate jackals who held the mortgage on the house I grew up in came calling. And they gave not one-quarter of a damn that the man had been within a hair's breadth of dying.
Dad eventually scraped together a couple of months' worth of mortgage payments, but the check came back uncashed; he couldn't pay the full amount overdue, so the mortgage company didn't want a penny of it. What it wanted, instead, was to take his house. And so it did.
My father, barely more than 50 years old and with only 20 percent of his heart still working, lost the modest life he'd put together through tireless labor over decades and had to move with my mother into my aunt's house for a time. He had, in his sudden infirmity, become an abstract problem for a business entity whose only concern was to hold on to every penny it could, decency be damned. And though his Teamster reps tried to intercede on his behalf, they were unable to persuade that entity to think of my father -- and treat him -- like a man.
I learned two things as I helplessly watched all this going down. First, only a sucker bets on a future more distant than his next breath. And second, the difference between being shaken down illegally and being shaken down legally is that instead of going to prison, the crooks in neckties get stock bonuses and gold Rolexes and hearty pats on the back for a job well done.
None of this is unusual. It's tragic and infuriating and grievous, but it is also very, very normal. Using fine print and loopholes and the tectonic grind of the legal process to cheat working people is as American as a Norman Rockwell painting. And while superficially there might not appear to be a direct connection between my father's losses and the W.G.A. strike, both spring directly from this time-honored exploitation of the powerless by the powerful.
Do I sound bitter? Good. I am. Still, after 20 years.
Now you know why I'm a union man myself and why I'm striking. Unions, imperfect though they might be, are the only entities that have ever provided an effective counterbalance to the corporate rapaciousness that victimized my father. A strike is not a fight at all, but rather a collective assertion of our dignity. It's not about money -- except insofar as, in America, money equals respect. For me, it's about the look in my father's eyes when he realized that not only was his body broken but so were all the implicit promises that go along with being a good worker bee and paying your taxes and staying on the right side of the law.
My old man eventually got a settlement and was able to buy a little double-wide in which he would die, five years later, at 57, of lung cancer that was surely a legacy of his military service and his working life as a firefighter. It was nice, I suppose, that he was made whole and could buy another home for himself and my mother, but the truth is that, as with the heart attack itself, the damage was done. The home he'd bought with his labor, in which he had raised his children, was gone. The humiliation and frustration of losing it couldn't be rolled back. This is another way they swindle you: making you feel that, hey, you got your money, the right thing has been done, so why are you still so unhappy?
I wonder if the people on the other side of the negotiating table will ever understand that it's not about money and never has been. There's an almost genetic-level memory of struggle and privation among working people, and we're tired of having to fight like animals simply to be treated like human beings. We're tired of entering into agreements that, one way or another, always get broken.
That's what this strike is about, at least for me. I don't need a cut of Netflix executives' stock compensation. What I need -- what I demand -- is that they treat me and the people I love as though our lives and labor are every bit as significant as theirs.

Full text: On TikTok, cringe comedy creators are gaining large followings and brand deals by impersonating terrible people.
During a three-part special examining the crimes of the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer that aired last November on "Dr. Phil," Phil McGraw, the host of the daytime talk show, played a TikTok video of a 27-year-old woman named Stanzi Potenza as evidence that true-crime fandom had gone too far. In the video, Ms. Potenza said she was so obsessed with Netflix's "Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story" that she stayed home from work in diapers to binge the series uninterrupted.
As it turns out, Ms. Potenza had made a video satirizing true-crime obsessives and Dr. Phil mistook it as sincere.
Ms. Potenza is a cringe comic and actor who describes herself as a "sketch comedian from hell." She has gained millions of followers on TikTok and YouTube by posting mansplaining public service announcements, sarcastic impersonations of Satan and bone-dry parodies of the horror film "The Purge."
"Personally, I think some of the best comedy is a little painful," she said. "It hurts so good."
As a concept, cringe is deceptively hard to describe. As a content category, cringe is vast, encompassing everything from dated cultural norms to a strategy that musical artists employ to reach real fans. Cringe is not any one thing, but you know it when you see it. On TikTok, you can make a career out of being intentionally cringeworthy in a niche area of the platform known as CringeTok (I know this because my brother, a former lawyer, has been making a living doing cringe videos since the spring of 2020).
Ms. Potenza has a theater degree and completed a six-week acting program at the William Esper Studio in New York, so she feels natural on camera. She ventured into posting cringe comedy videos during the pandemic as a way to continue working on her craft while venues were closed. An early TikTok video of her crying while applying clown makeup garnered hundreds of thousands of views and encouraged her to post more.
She now has more than 3.8 million followers on TikTok -- a following large enough that it can translate into lucrative brand deals, bonuses and merchandise sales. Her videos, she said, have earned her more than $ 200,000 annually.
The making of a CringeTok video
Popular creators on TikTok can make a living in all kinds of niches on the platform, including by doing makeup, dealing watches, being old -- even drinking flavored water. But CringeTok is more like putting on a show.
To craft the perfect CringeTok video, creators mine the depths of the internet and their own experiences for traits they can exaggerate. Identifying behaviors that make us recoil, like self-absorption and obliviousness, requires an ironic amount of self-reflection. Cringe comedy creators often build time for dreaming up sketches into their schedules. Filming can take as little as an hour -- often from the comfort of the creators' bedrooms.
These videos are different from unintentionally cringy videos in which an overabundance of earnestness combined with a lack of self-awareness leaves viewers feeling uncomfortable.
In those cases, "we're not laughing with you," Ms. Potenza said. "We're laughing at you."
Riri Bichri started posting CringeTok videos in 2020, and by April she had quit her job as an electrical engineer to pursue content creation full time. She has built a following of 800,000 subscribers by drawing on 2000s rom-com tropes, fan fiction and her own cringy behavior for inspiration.
"If I'm not embarrassed by what I did yesterday, if I'm not cringing about what I did yesterday, I did not grow," Ms. Bichri said.
Brad Podray, 40, is an orthodontist in Des Moines whose TikTok account, the Scumbag Dad, was originally a riff on the work of another TikTok creator, Nick Cho. Known online as Your Korean Dad, Mr. Cho plays a wholesome, fatherly figure who treats viewers as if they were his beloved children.
"A lot of my main comedy is based on identifying trends and deconstructing them to the point where they are no longer recognizable from the original inspiration," Mr. Podray said.
His P.O.V.-style videos feature a series of short sketches in which the Scumbag Dad exposes his fictional kid to progressively volatile situations. Early in Season 1 of the parodies, Mr. Podray steals his child's prescription pain medication, and by Season 6 his child is helping him assassinate drug dealers.
"I never got to complete the series, unfortunately, because TikTok banned me too many times," Mr. Podray said. TikTok prohibits videos featuring youth exploitation and abuse, fictional or otherwise, in its community guidelines, but Mr. Podray continues to make other kinds of parody videos. He said he earned about $ 150,000 a year from his content on TikTok and YouTube.
How the cringe creator economy works
In July 2020, TikTok established the Creator Fund to reward popular accounts and encourage content creation. It initially pledged to distribute $ 200 million and now expects the fund to grow beyond $ 1 billion. How much each creator gets, however, can vary.
"Payouts from the Creator Fund are based on a number of factors," said Maria Jung, TikTok's global product communications manager. "These factors include what region your video is viewed in, engagement on your video and the extent to which your video adheres to our community guidelines and terms of service."
It has been widely reported that eligible creators typically get a few cents for every thousand views a video gets, though Ms. Jung wouldn't confirm that number.
Creators with millions of followers and views per video can make a few thousand dollars a month from the Creator Fund. Having an engaged TikTok audience also allows creators to extend their reach on other social platforms. Meta discontinued their Reels Play bonus program in March, but creators can still earn money from Facebook Ad Reels, a program that operates similarly to YouTube's revenue-sharing model.
Cross-posting content to increase revenue streams is a common practice among creators.
"It wasn't until I became monetized on YouTube that I actually started making real money," Ms. Potenza said. "In order to make this a living, you have to utilize a lot of different methods to make it sustainable."
YouTube's business model is different from TikTok's in that it shares 50 percent of its ad revenue with its creators.
The combined revenue from social platforms can be significant, but the most lucrative opportunities come from brand partnerships.
Ms. Potenza recently created a sketch in which she played John Wick's therapist to promote the latest movie in the John Wick franchise. Mr. Podray's sponsors include Insta360, a camera company, and Lovehoney, an online sex toy store.
As their follower counts and average views per video grow, so do their rates. Ms. Potenza secured her first brand deal in 2020 and filmed a branded video for $ 150. The next year, as her account grew and she hired an agent to help her negotiate, her rate increased to $ 5,000 per video. These days, she wouldn't accept anything less than $ 10,000 for a sponsored post.
Ms. Bichri has gotten brand deals with companies like CashApp, Bubble Skincare and Pluto TV, but she's unsure how much money she has earned because, she said, her agency hasn't paid her for work she has done.
A nationwide TikTok ban, proposed in Congress because of the app's Chinese ownership, would put all creator revenue streams -- not to mention hard work -- into question.
"Watching a bunch of congresspeople talking at the C.E.O. of TikTok about things they don't understand was really embarrassing," Ms. Potenza said. "It makes me super pro-China at this point."
Everything's cringe
What isn't cringe today can be cringe tomorrow. Much like death and taxes, cringe comes for everyone eventually. So, it shouldn't come as a surprise that brands are interested in participating. Being authentically embarrassing is still authentic.
Wendell Scott, 32, is a production coordinator in Atlanta who instructs Delta Air Lines on how to make effective social media content. He uses his downtime to create TikTok videos in which he provides one side of a cringy conversation in a duet or stitched video with other creators. In one video with nearly two million views, he plays a founding father who discovers John Hancock's large signature on the Declaration of Independence.
"For me, cringe is something that we've all experienced, but we don't like to talk about it," Mr. Scott said. "Every single person has had some sort of odd, off-the-wall moment or something they think is off the wall, but it's actually very real. And I love bringing that to life."

At Cannes, Female Desire Comes to Fore: [Correction]

Full text: New dramas by Catherine Breillat and Todd Haynes examine relationships between older women and teenage boys in different yet equally complex ways.
After the first weekend wraps at the Cannes Film Festival, the sound of suitcases clacking over the stone walkways here begins to fill the air. For the sleep-deprived who remain, though, the 76th edition ends Saturday night when the Palme d'Or will be handed out, capping one of the strongest festivals in years.
There have been, of course, the usual misses and worse -- Jessica Hausner's bludgeoning satire "Club Zero," Jean-Stéphane Sauvaire's ridiculous "Black Flies" -- but the good news outweighs the bad. The latest from Wes Anderson, "Asteroid City," a comic inversion of a Norman Rockwell-style world, is very good, as is the most recent from the Italian veteran Marco Bellocchio. His "Kidnapped" is a furious, operatic dramatization of the life and tragic fate of Edgardo Mortara, a 6-year-old Jewish child who in 1858 was snatched by Vatican thugs from his family's home in Bologna. The child had apparently been covertly baptized, or so the Vatican claimed, and as a Christian could not be raised by Jewish parents.
For American moviegoers seeking more than blockbuster thrills, the stream of good reviews from Cannes is very welcome, though whether this will help entice art-film lovers back into theaters is the question. Even so, most of the movies will secure American distribution and, despite concerns about the Writers Guild strike affecting future projects, notable deals have been made. Netflix, for one, picked up Todd Haynes's "May December," about the aftermath of a woman's sexual relationship with an underage boy. Here's hoping that the streaming service, which desperately loves winning awards, releases it in theaters so that the movie can be eligible for next year's Oscars and editors will keep running stories on it.
While the academy's voters have become more adventurous in the past decade or so, "May December" seems too perverse and, frankly, too intellectually sophisticated and playful to secure a best picture nod. Still, its two superb female leads -- Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore -- will invariably be part of the next awards-season frenzy. That said, I can't help but wonder what kind of bump it could have gotten if it had instead been bought by Neon, which evaded foreign-language film marginalization by turning "Parasite" into a must-see. Presumably the distributor will try to do the same with the formally precise, psychologically fraught drama "Anatomy of a Fall," the latest from the French filmmaker Justine Triet.
"May December" focuses on Elizabeth (Portman), a popular TV actress set to star in a movie about a woman, Gracie (Moore), who was imprisoned after she was caught with the boy, Joe (a revelatory Charles Melton). The two later married and had several children. The movie opens around the same time that Elizabeth arrives in Gracie's waterfront hometown, settling into a visit with unexpected consequences. In an effort to find the role, Elizabeth tries to learn what makes Gracie tick, yet the deeper the actress explores her subject, the more she chips away at the couple's happily-ever-after.
As he has done throughout a career that includes "Far From Heaven" and "Carol," Haynes uses melodramatic conventions to fascinating effect, though he does so here with jolts of rich, destabilizing humor. Elizabeth may be searching for a character, but Gracie has already found the role of a lifetime as a martyr to her own desires, a part she perfects with waves of self-pity and monstrous narcissism. Playing with shifting tones and modes of realism, Haynes explores the intersection of real life and the self as a performance, routinely deploying flourishes of dramatic music that once could have accompanied a Joan Crawford meltdown but also have been rich comic fodder for the likes of Carol Burnett.
"May December" would make quite the seasonal double bill with "Last Summer," the latest from the French auteur Catherine Breillat. A terrific Léa Drucker stars as an outwardly content, happily married lawyer and mother whose carefully ordered world is profoundly rocked with the arrival of her husband's 17-year-old son (Samuel Kircher). Once the kid arrives and peels off his shirt, playing peekaboo under a crown of floppy hair, it seems fairly clear where the story is headed. Yet there's nothing obvious about this movie, which, with shifting camera angles, differing points of view and gradually escalating emotional violence, creates an extraordinarily complex inquiry into desire and power.
"Last Summer" will probably continue on the international festival circuit in the fall, though it is unlikely to generate as much attention as some of the most excitedly received features here. Among the buzziest has been "The Zone of Interest," a soulless formalist exercise from the British filmmaker Jonathan Glazer. Based on the novel by Martin Amis of the same title, it takes place largely inside the walled grounds of a house immediately adjacent to Auschwitz. There, as pillars of smoke rise in the sky, the death camp's commandant (Christian Friedel) and his wife (Sandra Hüller) are living their lives -- eating, raising children, somehow sleeping -- to the nonstop sounds of screams, shouts and gunfire.
Glazer's great talent is for creating mysterioso atmospheres (he's best known for "Birth" and "Under the Skin"), and he gets his creep on again in this movie with eerie stillness, precise framing, minimalist dialogue and meticulous shocks. It is the lack of ideas in Glazer's work that has always been the problem. Within this movie's first 10 minutes, the words "banality of evil," Hannah Arendt's oft-quoted phrase about the Holocaust, will probably pass through your mind; it will keep on passing -- and passing and then start circling -- because Glazer has nothing to add to our understanding of the Shoah except as fodder for art-film banality.
"The Zone of Interest" makes a pointed contrast with "Fallen Leaves," a tender, beautifully directed love story from the Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki, who won the Grand Jury Prize in 2002 for his drama "The Man Without a Past." With his signature deadpan humor, brilliant timing and lapidary visuals, Kaurismaki brings together only to then separate two painfully lonely people, Ansa (Alma Poysti) and Holappa (Jussi Vatanen). They meet and go to the movies -- the cinema's lobby prominently features a poster for a film by Robert Bresson, a Kaurismaki touchstone -- then endure chance accidents and bad decisions.
As is his custom, Kaurismaki -- who strolled into his premiere greeted by rapturous applause and shouts of "Aki!" -- packs a great deal into his minimalist narrative, creating a deeply human world filled with doleful faces, plaintive desires and thwarted dreams that he tempers with dry humor, political anger and a lot of movie love. "Fallen Leaves" was especially delightful to see at Cannes because when the couple goes to the movies, it's to watch "The Dead Don't Die," the Jim Jarmusch zombie comedy that opened the 2019 festival. The audience howled, and I imagine so did Jarmusch, who had arrived at the screening of his old friend's film early, securing a perfect center seat for this perfect delight.

Why We Still Want To Be in Interrogation Three Decades Later: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The influential crime drama debuted 30 years ago. Here, the creators and stars reflect on its legacy and on an early episode that served notice that it was a different sort of cop show.
For television historians amateur and professional, the easiest place to begin the story of the contemporary Golden Age of Television is on Jan. 10, 1999, when Tony Soprano first paid a toll on the New Jersey Turnpike. But perhaps we might be better served to rewind the clock approximately six years, to Jan. 31, 1993, the night of Super Bowl XXVII. The Dallas Cowboys demolished the Buffalo Bills, 52-17, and the broadcast was followed by the premiere of a new NBC drama, set in Baltimore, studying the work of the city's homicide detectives.
The series was called "Homicide: Life on the Street," and it was based on a book by David Simon, then a Baltimore Sun reporter who had spent a year tagging along with the police department's homicide squad. Post-Super Bowl premiere notwithstanding, "Homicide" was never a ratings success, but it stayed on the air for seven seasons, winning four Emmys and three Peabody Awards. The show was prickly, funny, morally forceful, endlessly discursive and filled with a murderers' row of actors, including the future stars Andre Braugher (who won an Emmy for his performance as Frank Pembleton), Melissa Leo and Giancarlo Esposito, along with veterans like Ned Beatty, Yaphet Kotto and Richard Belzer, known primarily then as a stand-up comedian.
The show's fifth episode, "Three Men and Adena," which first aired in March, was a stark, dramatic example of what made "Homicide" different from other cop shows. (In the DVD release, the episode is sixth.) It takes place almost entirely within the confines of an interrogation room, with the detectives Pembleton and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) attempting to wring a confession out of Risley Tucker (Moses Gunn), an itinerant fruit-and-vegetable man, after the murder of a little girl named Adena Watson. Pembleton and Bayliss prod, provoke and rage, but "Homicide" refuses to grant the audience the resolution they crave. Tucker doesn't crack. Adena's case is never solved. (The showrunner, Tom Fontana, won an Emmy for writing the episode)
Thirty years later, Fontana, the executive producers Barry Levinson and Paul Attanasio and the actors Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor reflected on "Three Men and Adena," in particular, and on the broader legacy of the series and their frustration at its still not being available to stream. These are edited excerpts from conversations with them.
After Levinson, a Baltimore native known for setting films like "Diner" and "Avalon" in the city, read Simon's book, he knew he wanted to adapt it. But he thought TV would be a better venue. He hired Attanasio to create the series and write the pilot, and he eventually brought in Fontana to run the show.
TOM FONTANA I said, "I'm not really sure I want to do a cop show." And Levinson said: "This is about the homicide detectives. They're thinking cops. There's no gun battles, there's no car chases." And I said: "That's impossible. I'll do it."
BARRY LEVINSON I thought it ought to be done completely in Baltimore. We can do it really down and dirty and lean. Instead of shooting 35-millimeter film, we'll shoot in Super 16 and with hand-held cameras.
FONTANA I think I've read David's book more times than I've read any other book in my life. By the time we were done, we'd used everything in the book, including the commas and question marks.
PAUL ATTANASIO I built Frank Pembleton out of the idea of a character who didn't want a partner. And then Kyle's character, Bayliss, was a more functional, more conventional television character who was the rookie, so you could use him as a guide to bring you into the show.
FONTANA Our premiere was after the Super Bowl. NBC was very jazzed about that. I said to Barry: "After the Super Bowl, everybody's drunk! This isn't a show you can watch drunk."
ANDRE BRAUGHER The first year, there was a sort of Jean-Luc Godard jump-cut sensibility that we enjoyed.
FONTANA I said to Barry, "You know, I'd love to write an episode that basically only takes place in the interrogation room." And he said: "Let's just try it. Let's try everything."
KYLE SECOR I went in and met them. Within a couple minutes, they said, "The sixth episode we're going to do, it's just going to be three guys in an interrogation room. It'll be you, your partner and this other character." And I went, "Oh, well, I'm in."
FONTANA The real girl who was murdered in Baltimore, that the Adena Watson story was based on, her murder was never solved. I made a decision that we would never solve the murder on the show because we felt like it would be disrespectful to the family and to the young girl's memory.
SECOR We had rehearsals before shooting, which was a comfort. Andre and I had spent a lot of time in that room, and it felt like that was our room. We had control of that room.
BRAUGHER We performed it like a theater piece. There's nowhere to go. It's a strangely shaped little room with a door and a window. So it's just three men going around and around and around again.
FONTANA We are asking the audience to watch this hour of intense interrogation and then not give them the solution they were hoping for. That was satisfying for me, as well, because I didn't want it to be all neat and tidy at the end.
ATTANASIO I think what's really brilliant about that script is, it's one thing to say you're not to give the audience what they're looking for. But then the question is, what are you going to give them? And what Tom gave them was heartbreak. And irresolution.
FONTANA I knew the rhythms of Andre and Secor. And I knew that it had to have twists and turns, and that eventually, Tucker would start indicting them. I knew going in that was the way it would travel.
ATTANASIO It's not just good like bran cereal is good for you. It's electrifying. You can't take your eyes off it. And all it is, is three actors in a room.
BRAUGHER It's the most fun I've had filming an episode. It was physically hard, it was emotionally taxing, but it was very satisfying.
At the end of the episode, Bayliss takes the photograph of Adena from the interrogation room and places it on his desk, where it remains for multiple seasons.
SECOR When I met Tom Pellegrini, who was the detective that I was based on, I got Bayliss immediately as someone where being unable to solve this case affected his entire life. Affected his marriage, affected relationships, affected his job, affected how he saw his work, everything.
FONTANA If you're going to track a character over the life of a series, you need to see the stuff that he or she accumulates. There was an episode where he puts the picture in a drawer. He was sort of like, "I have to get past this now."
BRAUGHER That's one of the beautiful things about the episode. It doesn't resolve in favor of our heroes. The moral frustration in the entire series is that Adena Watson's murder is never solved.
FONTANA My career has been an endless number of shows that I'm proud of that never were in the Top 10, starting with "St. Elsewhere."
ATTANASIO Don Ohlmeyer [then NBC's West Coast president] loved the show, as long as they could make it for a reasonable amount of money.
BRAUGHER When I think back to that initial group, that first- and second-year group, it was a wonderful cast and boy, were we quirky. Boy, were we misfits, and I loved it.
ATTANASIO I met somebody once, and she told me her husband had a "Homicide" room in his house. He had a chair, and he had a TV, and every Friday night he would go in and watch that show. And it was the only show he watched. Does that matter to me more than ratings? Yes!
BRAUGHER I looked with amusement at "NYPD Blue" and all those other shows that began to incorporate all the techniques that we had, dare I say, pioneered for television.
LEVINSON For the last four years, I've tried to get an answer for why we're not on streaming. No one, I mean no one, has been able to give me an answer. There's money to be made. You can't figure out how to handle whatever rights issues that may come up? You're talking over 120-some episodes. And somehow no one can figure out how to handle the rights? That doesn't make sense!
SECOR Who knows? Maybe we'll start streaming on Netflix!

Full text: A new search in Portugal has brought the case of the British girl, missing since 2007, back to the headlines.
This week, the case of Madeleine McCann, a British girl who disappeared 16 years ago at the age of 3 from a vacation apartment in Portugal, returned once again to saturate media coverage as the Portuguese police resumed searching for the girl.
The police said in a statement that the new searches would be carried out in the Algarve region, where the girl vanished in 2007 while on vacation with her parents and siblings. They were requested by the German authorities and will be conducted in the presence of the British authorities, the police said.
The Portuguese television network SIC reported that the police were going to search an area at the Arade Dam, about 30 miles from the seaside village of Praia da Luz, where the family had stayed on vacation. According to the news channel, the area used to be frequented by a German man who has been named as a suspect in the case. A German prosecutor said that they were investigating in Algarve "on the basis of certain tips," according to Sky News.
The searches have revived a case that has gripped Europe for years, prompted an international search effort, become the subject of books, front pages and a Netflix documentary series, while generating infinite speculation, empty hopes and tips.
Here is what we know about the case:
Madeleine's disappearance
Kate and Gerry McCann, Madeleine's parents, said that they left Madeleine and her siblings, 2-year-old twins, in their vacation apartment while they dined at a nearby restaurant.
Madeleine's father checked on the children at about 9 p.m., and all of them were there, but when his wife checked on them about an hour later, Madeleine was gone. A search started soon after, but it produced few significant leads.
The disappearance of the girl triggered an outpouring of public interest and grief that was compared to the British national mourning following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, with Madeleine's face printed on "Missing" posters and T-shirts.
An initial investigation by the Portuguese police did not produce concrete results but drew widespread criticism after Madeleine's parents were named as suspects. They were formally cleared in 2008.
In 2020, German prosecutors made clear that they did not expect to find Madeleine alive and that new evidence led them to conclude that the girl was probably the victim of a homicide.
Who is the suspect?
It was not clear why the new searches were launched, but in 2020, German authorities said a German sex offender was under investigation on suspicion of murder. They did not name him, but the German media has identified him as a man named Christian B.
The suspect lived on and off in the Algarve region of Portugal between 1995 to 2007. He has a criminal record for sexual abuse of children, and at the time of his identification, he was already in a German prison because of an unrelated sexual crime and drug offenses. A German prosecutor said that the suspect had made a living through drug dealing but also working in restaurants, selling used cars and stealing from hotel rooms and vacation homes.
British detectives said they received their first tip about the suspect after making a public appeal in 2017 on the 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance. He has not been charged with crimes related to the her disappearance, and he has always denied involvement. In 2022, the Portuguese police made him a formal suspect.
British newspapers have in the past years been filled with interviews with people who have known the suspect in the attempt to piece together useful information.
Has the area been searched before?
Overall, hundreds of volunteers have helped the family look for Madeleine around the world.
The coordinated operation by German and Portuguese authorities is the first formal search in the dam area, but in 2008, Marcos Aragão Correia, a Portuguese lawyer not connected to the case, hired specialist divers to check the area following some tips he said he had received.
In 2014 the British police, who also opened an investigation, known as Operation Grange, examined scrubland near the resort where she disappeared for several days but found no evidence.
On May 3, Madeleine's family gathered to commemorate the 16th anniversary of her disappearance. "Still missing ....... still very much missed," her family wrote in a statement. "We await a breakthrough," it added.
What do we know about the search?
The British news media, galvanized by the announcement from the Portuguese police, have thoroughly followed the search, which could possibly lead to a long-awaited answer to a mystery of international interest.
They reported that the police on Tuesday focused on a peninsula near a reservoir, and that a police motorboat was sent into the water basin. According to The Guardian, officers used pickaxes, chain saws and rakes to search the peninsula and the surrounding woods.
The BBC said the police had deployed sniffer dogs along the bank of the reservoir and that they were expecting the operation to last a few more days.

One Call and Many Virtual Dates Later, It's a Match: [Society Desk]

Full text: Jennifer Kizza and Field Brown felt an immediate connection during their first phone conversation two years ago. "I knew that day, romantic or not, Field was going to be in my life for the rest of my life," she said.
Jennifer Frances Namuli Kizza was feeling tired after work one evening in March 2021. And yet she still kept a scheduled first phone call with Donald Mayfield Brown, whom she had met through a dating app.
Ms. Kizza, 28, from Gainesville, Fla., had previously given up on finding a serious relationship. But now, as a medical student at Harvard, she wanted to make the time. "It was really challenging for me to find people where I felt like we both had the same goals for our relationship and for what romance looked like," she said.
Mr. Brown, 31, who goes by Field, was living in Starkville, Miss., at the time, teaching in the English and African American studies department at Mississippi State University and finishing his dissertation research. He changed his location on the dating app Hinge to Boston with the hope of pursuing a relationship while finishing his doctoral degree at Harvard.
Ms. Kizza expected their first phone call to be brief, but it lasted for nearly an hour. The two bonded over a shared Southern upbringing, their families and similar poundcake recipes they were fond of. Mr. Brown's came from his mother.
On their first virtual date in April, they watched an episode of "Waffles + Mochi," a Netflix series about healthy food hosted by Michelle Obama.
"Growing up in the conservative Black Belt South, I didn't want to watch a show with a lot of explicit stuff on my first date," Mr. Brown said. "I didn't want to lead that way with the person I wanted to be with."
They eventually moved on to the Starz drama series "Power" over several more virtual dates.
Before matching on Hinge, the two had nearly crossed paths several years earlier.
Mr. Brown was attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar, working toward a master's degree in history. He left by July 2016 to return to Harvard to start a Ph.D. program, three months before Ms. Kizza arrived at Oxford to pursue a master's in global health science. That spring, she had graduated from Harvard with a bachelor's degree in neurobiology and global health and health policy.
In September 2017, she became a Fulbright research fellow in Uganda alongside her father, who received his grant to teach and research the impact of soil pollution. Ms. Kizza, who began medical school at Harvard in 2018, will be doing her residency at Massachusetts General Hospital this summer.
Mr. Brown graduated from Mississippi State University in 2014 with a bachelor's in philosophy and English. He earned a doctoral degree in English literature at Harvard last year and is currently a post-doctorate fellow at Brown.
Their first in-person date, at a Thai restaurant, wasn't until July 2021, when Mr. Brown returned to Boston. He recalled their laughter and cheerful banter from that first meeting. "I never really had a date like that," he said, adding that he was so wrapped up in their conversation that he left his credit card at the restaurant.
Mr. Brown would find more reasons to see Ms. Kizza again. When she needed to get to work for her medical rotations at Brigham and Women's Hospital, he would wake up at 5 a.m. to drive her so she wouldn't have to ride her bike.
Ms. Kizza invited him to attend her cousin's wedding in Orlando, Fla., in February 2022. It was the first time he met Ms. Kizza's family. Her mother is from Malawi and her father from Uganda; they live in Gainesville. It was a big step, and she knew her family would take it as a sign that the relationship was serious.
In the summer of 2022, Ms. Kizza met Mr. Brown's parents in Vicksburg, Miss. At the time, she was dealing with her father's cancer diagnosis and felt even more appreciative of the warm welcome she received.
"It was just the hardest times for my family and for me," she said. "It just felt like a miracle to just have this beautiful extension of people to support me."
Mr. Brown proposed last August. He planned a surprise outing to distract Ms. Kizza as he awaited the arrival of a photographer, her friends and her cousin at the Public Garden in Boston. First, they stopped at the cafe L.A. Burdick Handmade Chocolates to pick up her favorite pastry, and then they strolled around the Newbury Street shopping district. When they arrived at the garden, Mr. Brown got down on one knee.

The couple celebrated their upcoming nuptials with a kwanjula, a Ugandan engagement ceremony, in November in Gainesville. During an evening of costume changes, dancing and gifts presented to Ms. Kizza's family, Mr. Brown asked to marry her, again, in front of 150 guests.
They wed on April 29 at the Chapel of Memories on Mississippi State University's campus, a nod to Mr. Brown's Southern roots and time as an undergraduate. The wedding was officiated by Reginald L. Walker, a pastor at the Word of Faith Christian Center in Vicksburg. The couple asked that the 100 guests be vaccinated to attend.
In her vows, Ms. Kizza recalled their first phone call. "I knew that day, romantic or not, Field was going to be in my life for the rest of my life," she said.

Classical Crescendo: [Op-Ed]

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The orgasm heard around the world was reported by Magnus Fiennes, a composer and music producer who is the brother of Ralph Fiennes. After going to the Los Angeles Philharmonic in April, he tweeted about a woman sitting near him at Walt Disney Concert Hall who had a "loud and full body orgasm" during the second movement of Tchaikovsky's Fifth.
Some in the audience tweeted back, wondering if the moaning was due to a medical condition. But the woman, who stayed with her smiling partner for the whole concert, has not come forward to clear it up.
Whatever happened, the scream is a metaphor. As we discuss which musical genres are expiring -- Is rock 'n' roll dead, as Jann Wenner told me? Is jazz fading away? -- it seems that classical music is getting hotter.
Albert Imperato, a New York music promoter, says the idea is breaking through that classical music is not supposed to be safe and relaxing. It's supposed to tingle.
"Let's not forget that the word 'climax' is a common musical term," the soprano Renée Fleming told me. "It has to do with musical tension and its release." She said Rachmaninoff and Liszt "had it down" when it comes to sexy pieces.
To celebrate the scream, Norman Lebrecht, a British music journalist, ran "The 10 Best Orgasm Symphonies" in his blog, Slipped Disc.
Elim Chan, the 36-year-old conductor with the baton that night, told me she watched the woman in her peripheral vision until she "calmed down." She said she likes when audience members audibly react -- "I don't want to be a piece of museum art." We recalled how "Fantasia" and Bugs Bunny excited us as children, with their flights of classical music.
After the dark years of Covid and everyone at home streaming, she said, people are coming out to concerts to "feel something" that will exist only in that time -- "and if you miss it, you miss it."
The scream reminded me of the golden era in Hollywood, when moguls put their biggest stars -- Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Elizabeth Taylor, Ingrid Bergman -- into passionate tales about classical musicians. There has been a revival of that recently, with Cate Blanchett in "Tár," Kelvin Harrison Jr. in "Chevalier" and the upcoming Netflix movie "Maestro," with Bradley Cooper as Leonard Bernstein.
Several recent surveys have clocked a rise in the popularity of classical music in the last couple of years. In America and England, the genre flourished during the pandemic, drawing more women and younger listeners, and it's soaring among content creators on social media.
"Maybe that old orchestral and operatic music now sounds fresh to ears raised on electronic sounds," the music critic Ted Gioia mused on his Substack, or "maybe young people view getting dressed up for a night at the opera hall as a kind of cosplay event."
Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, agreed. "The average age of our audience used to be in the 60s; now it's in the 40s," he told me.
He said that new operas by living composers -- Terence Blanchard's "Fire Shut Up in My Bones" and "Champion" and Kevin Puts's "The Hours" -- are big draws. Gelb said that "Champion," based on the life of Emile Griffith, a bisexual boxer, is the first time the Met has featured two men kissing or drag queens.
New York is the epicenter of the electricity. Cue Dudamania. Gustavo Dudamel, the 42-year-old curly-haired conductor who looks for "blood" in the music, is moving from Los Angeles to take over the New York Philharmonic in 2026. He promised to "keep that wild, wild animal Gustavo," giving audiences a preview this weekend at David Geffen Hall, conducting Mahler's Ninth.
At the Met, the 48-year-old conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin is a bolt of lightning with bleached-blond hair and a diamond earring. In elaborate costumes inspired by whatever opera he is conducting, he shakes off classical music's conservative air.
Keri-Lynn Wilson, the six-foot glamazon who conducts in black Armani pantsuits with her ponytail swinging -- and who is part of a classical music power couple with her husband, Peter Gelb -- sparkled in her debut at the Met last fall with Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk."
"I actually conducted an orgasm in it," she said about the climactic sex scene. "Shostakovich achieved it through the sequencing of a relentlessly building and sliding trombone lick in unison with the entire orchestra in a pulsating crescendo." She said Stalin banned the work and Shostakovich narrowly avoided the gulag.
New York is also home to Yuja Wang, the 36-year-old pianist who wears high-fashion miniskirts and stilettos for her bravura performances of Rachmaninoff.
Nézet-Séguin told me he thinks we are "beginning another golden age for our art form."
"Without accusing anyone," he said, he believes "institutions and maybe artists forgot some aspects of our art form" and "maybe the connection with the audience was just not enough of a priority, in my opinion."
He said that in rehearsals, he always tells the orchestra to explore the love. "'Love every note. Love more your eighth notes. Please love this harmony more.' It's very connected to classical music being sexy."

They All Share a Certain Nightmare: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Levi Holloway on his psychological thriller starring Laurie Metcalf: "It wears the jacket of horror. But I think it's more heart than horror."
When it comes to plays that inspire fear, unsettle the audience or display horrific intensity, only a handful come to mind. Martin McDonagh's gruesome "The Pillowman" is one. Tracy Letts came up with two: the gleefully nasty thriller "Killer Joe" and the paranoia tale "Bug."
This certainly makes Levi Holloway's "Grey House," now in previews at Broadway's Lyceum Theater, an oddity. The premise is classic horror: Stranded in a blizzard, a couple (Tatiana Maslany and Paul Sparks) end up in an eerie house filled with rather unusual children and their minder (Laurie Metcalf).
"It wears the jacket of horror," Holloway said of his play, which premiered in Chicago in 2019. "But I think it's more heart than horror."
The genre may be scarce onstage but none of the major players here are strangers to works investigating disturbing tensions or the boundaries of reality. Metcalf and Sparks share a Stephen King connection: she starred in "Misery" on Broadway, and he was in Season 2 of Hulu's "Castle Rock," which is set in King's fictional universe. Maslany's virtuosic portrayal of numerous clones in the series "Orphan Black" earned her an Emmy Award. Millicent Simmonds played Emily Blunt's daughter, Regan, in "A Quiet Place" and "A Quiet Place Part 2," while Sophia Anne Caruso played Lydia in the "Beetlejuice" musical on Broadway and starred in the Netflix fantasy film "The School for Good and Evil."
Even the director, Joe Mantello, has partaken, putting on his actor's cap to play a reporter in "American Horror Story: NYC."
During a series of interviews that took place in the Lyceum's appropriately atmospheric basement lounge, members of the show's cast and creative team discussed what horror means to them, and the particular challenges and rewards of "Grey House," which opens on May 30. These are edited excerpts from those conversations.
Levi Holloway
When Holloway was 5, his father took him to see "A Nightmare on Elm Street" in a movie theater. "The skin was taken off of me," Holloway said, "I was so scared."
Undeterred, his father eventually bought him a subscription to the horror film magazine Fangoria, so young Levi could understand the mechanics of fear. To encourage his kid to read, Dad gave him books by Stephen King, starting with "The Stand."
As a playwright, he has embraced horror partly out of genuine love (he mentioned John Carpenter's "The Thing" as a favorite, and don't get him started on why "The Exorcist III" is the best of the series) but also as a way to process a major trauma: In 2016, his twin sister was killed at the age of 35. "It was so meaningless and pointless, and such a baffling event that it got me thinking about the why of it," he said.
"I started thinking about predestination and fate and how no matter what direction we're going, we're going to end up where we have to be," Holloway continued. "So I wanted to write about that, and I wanted to write about grief, where you put it and the house that holds it."
Sophia Anne Caruso
"Mind games, manipulation, psychological thrillers in general are the scariest genre of quote horror to me," Caruso said. "And I think that this play definitely sits in the 'psychological thriller' section of horror."
The young actress has her issues with the genre, in which she sees women as often losing power. "But throughout this story, we are holding a lot of power without people directly realizing it," she said of the play's women. (Well, maybe not all of them.)
"What I love about my character is I feel like she's always one step ahead," Caruso said of her role, which makes the most of the actress's gift for sardonic delivery. "She knows exactly where we're going but she doesn't show it, and that's a fun frustration to play with."
Joe Mantello
Before rehearsals began, Mantello watched "The Shining," in which he saw parallels with Holloway's play. "It's a psychological thriller and, yes, there are elements of gore in it, but I think it was the isolation of that family in a very wintry landscape," he said of the Stanley Kubrick film. "And some presence that is altering the trajectory of their lives."
As one of Broadway's most in-demand directors, Mantello is used to figuring out exacting scripts, but he initially found the one for "Grey House" to be elusive. So he asked Holloway what animated the play's inner logic. "I think that it's important in this genre that this world has a particular set of rules, this house has a particular set of rules," Mantello said. "Though the audience may not ever completely comprehend exactly what those rules are, we all have to be crystal-clear about them and adhere to them."
The "grey house" is not just a physical place, either: it seems to connect to a generalized anxiety that feels very modern, even though the show is set in 1977. "I feel that the world is in an incredibly dangerous place right now, and I'm very connected to the idea of people in peril," Mantello said. Laughing, he added, "In this particular case, the danger is seemingly benign children, mysterious children."
Laurie Metcalf
"The thing that shook me the most was 'The Exorcist,"' Metcalf said of her earliest encounters with horror films. "I think I was in my early teens and that did me in for horror for the next 50-something years."
And now here she is, starring in "Grey House." Metcalf was drawn by the prospect of working again with Mantello, her frequent collaborator, and she was curious as to how he would handle a script that, she admitted, she did not "completely understand" the first time she read it. "I knew that Joe saw something in it that I wanted to be in the room to discover also," she said.
The show has to balance a tricky combination of dark wit and unsettling atmosphere. "The audience is going to teach us that piece of the puzzle -- their reactions will definitely tell us a lot," Metcalf said of how the comedy and horror genres thrive on viewers' feedback. "We'll learn how far we can go with the humor and the thrills."
She added, "I had the same feeling in 'The Beauty Queen of Leenane,' which is horrific and funny," Metcalf said, referring to performing in the Steppenwolf production of Martin McDonagh's play, back in 1999. "Leading the audience through the laughs into where we're headed is a real fun actors' path to take."
Millicent Simmonds
As Caruso pointed out, genre cinema, especially horror, can be a fraught place for women. For Simmonds, who is deaf, there is an additional layer. "It's rare to see Deaf people who actually have that kind of power and agency to navigate a world," she said of her character, through an interpreter. "They're often portrayed as victims, a pity creature, somebody to help. When I read the script," she added, "it was about just a person, not necessarily that they're a Deaf person."
Simmonds said that in general she has a hard time dealing with spiders and graphic violence in films, and cited Darren Aronofsky's "Black Swan" as having affected her "because you don't know what's real and what's not" -- something that also applies to "Grey House."
Cagey, like her colleagues, about discussing the play in detail, Simmonds allowed that she sees it as a maternal story. "It investigates this question of what is a mother," she said. "What does a mother mean to each of us? What do you need to sacrifice to be a mother? How do you raise a family?"
Paul Sparks
Like Mantello, Sparks connected the show to a larger sense of dread that is haunting our society, a sense that our world is unsettled. "There's a lot of things that we can't control and things that we don't understand, and things that aren't what we think they are," he said. "All that stuff is in this play."
The actor pointed out that "Grey House" uses a major horror trope, the cabin in the woods. But Holloway spins it in a novel way, inserting a cryptic side to the story that made Sparks want to pick it apart, and decode it.
But he hopes audiences show some restraint in how much they share after seeing it. "I've been really going out of my way to not tell people anything about what's going on," he said. "These actors, these kids -- I think people are not going to know what to expect. And it's not even going to be close to anything they can imagine.
"I think you're going to be shocked," he added. "I really do."

Full text: More than 20 years into an idiosyncratic career, the musician and activist is finally opening up for real on "Michael," his first solo album in more than a decade.
ATLANTA -- Don't let the villainous stage name, the big-man baritone or the rap bluster fool you: Killer Mike is a crier.
The man born Michael Render -- a trash-talking musician, activist, organizer, father of four and political punching bag who also hits back -- has a knack, in song and speech, for righteous fury. But these days, nearing 50 and closer than ever to self-actualization, it's when the tears start flowing that Killer Mike knows he is really gathering momentum, saying what needs to be said.
"You're a musician, you get rich and start doing all kinds of crazy stuff like drinking green juice in the morning," he explained last month, the day after his 48th birthday, during a particularly tearful conversation charting his recent path to more openness and acceptance. "Then your wife convinces you to go see a therapist."
Always a searcher with plenty of self-awareness, Mike had a read on many of his own issues already. Yet therapy sessions with a Black woman, in particular, taught him that "there's nothing wrong with a lot of the inclinations you have because of how you were raised," Mike said. "But you got to get to the bottom of who you are, to understand the whys."
That was when he started looking in the mirror, a process of personal excavation and revelation documented across "Michael," the first Killer Mike solo album in 11 years, out June 16. "Face to face with fate had to face my fears," he raps on "Shed Tears," one especially raw new song. "It was me/I'm the reason that I failed/that was hell."
"When you finally get that out," Mike said, "that's one of the most burden-lifting moments."
The fact that he had been holding anything back -- and especially out of his music, which has tended, over the last decade, toward the galvanizing war cries of his boisterous duo Run the Jewels -- might be tough to imagine for those who have followed Killer Mike's prolific, idiosyncratic career of more than 20 years. Yet even after hundreds of rap verses, his time as a television host, a Bernie Sanders surrogate and a go-to cultural ambassador for the city of Atlanta, there was plenty that he was still keeping to himself.
It wasn't until late in the process of recording "Michael," for example, that he realized he had never spoken aloud -- let alone recorded -- some simple words that were so foundational to the man he had become: My mama dead. My grandmama dead.

A complex portrait of Southern Black masculinity, the album details the life of a proud patriarch somewhere near peace through the stories and lessons of the women who shepherded him: his grandmother Bettie Clonts, who raised him and died in 2012, and his mother, Denise Clonts, or Niecy, who had him at 16 and died in 2017.
"I'm not absent men in my life, but there's something about that matriarchal love that my grandmother and my mother gave me that has allowed me to embrace my humanity more," Mike said. On the album's centerpiece "Motherless," in which he confronts their influence and absence, he raps of all he has achieved, addressing them directly: "A Black boy born to a teen momma, momma/gets regarded as a leader by his people, momma."
"This album was about finally controlling my own narrative, not being an artist-in-proxy," Mike said, noting that he had always been attached to others -- a one-time protégé of Outkast; a sidekick to T.I.; a partner in crime to El-P in Run the Jewels. Because while being one of rap's top character actors had afforded him a steady flow of supporting roles, "I needed to do my film before the curtains closed on me."
A lifetime devotee of comic books, Mike likened "Michael" to a superhero's origin story -- the Logan to his usual Wolverine. Crucially, the setting for his ups and downs has always been Atlanta, a city "where all the heroes and villains look like me," Mike said, counting civil rights icons and kingpins among his mentors.
"My neighborhood had everything from working-class Black people like my grandparents to the bootleggers, the numbers man, Morehouse coaches to the Herman Russell family," he explained. "I'm a culmination of that whole Black experience. I guess for people who still don't have a proper understanding of Atlanta, I am Harlem as a ghetto and its renaissance in one human being."
Denise embodied this dichotomy as well. "She was an artist," Mike said -- a florist and music-lover who hosted bohemian hangouts. "But she was also a drug trafficker." Two weeks before Mike turned 15, she was arrested, he said, along with a boyfriend, while transporting 10 kilos of cocaine from south of the city. (The man claimed responsibility and took the fall, Mike said.)
So it was Denise whom Mike visited a few years later when he was bristling at his Morehouse College work-study job and hoping to get into drug dealing instead. "It's not what a son should ask a mother," he said, but she made the necessary introductions anyway. "And I went to work."
This wasn't the life that his grandmother -- the daughter of sharecroppers from Tuskegee, Ala., a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a steely advocate for education and religion -- had wanted for him, especially after he dropped out of college.
"But my business bought me the music equipment that got me the demo made that got us the street tapes we sold during Freaknik that got Big Boi's attention that got me a record deal," Mike said, referring to his journey through the Atlanta party and nightlife circuit. And it was Big Boi, of Outkast, who eventually asked him outright: "What you want to do, you want to be a dope dealer, or you want to be a rapper?"
Then and there, Mike picked his craft. "I didn't want to be looking over my shoulder, I didn't want to be straddling the fence, working two worlds," he said.
Yet despite winning a Grammy for his first-ever appearance on a single, Killer Mike's career as a major-label leading man faltered as the music business started to crater in the mid-2000s. Too socially conscious for the mainstream and too gangster for the backpack crowd, Mike became a creature of the mixtape underground, piecing together projects to survive as an artist and a father.
It wasn't until his 2012 album, "R.A.P. Music," which paired Mike with another independent journeyman, the producer and M.C. El-P, that a creative breakthrough became a critical, and then a commercial, one. The next year, the pair released "Run the Jewels," announcing a duo that would make them industry anomalies: rappers who gained relevance and appetite with age.
"Run the Jewels reinvigorated my love and want for rap that was not out of necessity," Mike said. "I'm supposed to have been decimated from a confidence standpoint. But something has always told me, don't give up."
A fixture at music festivals and on soundtracks ("Booksmart," "The Big Short," "Black Panther" ), Run the Jewels also made him rich, finally. "I remember the first time I woke up a millionaire," Mike said, placing the moment somewhere after the release of the second Run the Jewels album in 2014. "But it was right around tax season. And then I was a $ 600,000-aire."
The success of the group allowed Mike and his wife, Shana Render, to diversify their wealth into small businesses and real estate, especially rental properties, a move he said he learned from Outkast. But the specific tenor of Run the Jewels' chest-puffing and moral certitude, plus Mike's civil-rights upbringing and natural loquaciousness, also turned him into an authoritative public brand of his own, a truth-telling talking head who came to represent an insular community on an international scale.
Such status afforded Killer Mike endless media appearances, a turn as a polarizing Bernie surrogate in 2016 and a Netflix documentary series called "Trigger Warning." But the problem with becoming a spokesman against the system in a time of upheaval, especially as a proudly heterodox thinker, is that eventually, to some, you represent the system itself.
In recent years, Killer Mike has become a target for a certain type of leftist criticism, especially from Black activists and anticapitalists, who decried his emotional admonishment of protesters after the killing of George Floyd in 2020; his interview about the importance of Black gun ownership to NRATV in the wake of the Parkland school shooting; or his chumminess with Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp.
"There are people who live to disagree and to catch a celebrity, especially, in the wrong," Mike said, defiant as ever. "But I've been an activist way longer than I've been a successful rapper. You're having arguments and debates that I was having at 16 years old."
"You're a child to me -- and I don't mean that in an insulting way. You're just so young," he continued, growing heated even as he gestured toward empathy. "You don't understand the nuance of give and get. You don't understand the nuance of politics, of bartering. There is no winning team."
"I don't have time to win debates," he added, echoing the purposeful lack of nuance of "Talk'n That ___ ," one of the most confrontational tracks on "Michael."
Overall, however, the album, which was born of cathartic necessity during Covid, seeks understanding, not further division. Following a fierce bout with the virus early on, Mike realized, "I have to present something in these times that's not weak and feeble or exploitive and aimless. I have to present something from Atlanta that shows the tradition of thought and lyricism and wit and soul and gospel -- what Dungeon Family brought to the game, what Curtis Mayfield gave them, and what Outkast and Goodie Mob ushered into the world."
"And at the same time, acknowledge what's going on now," he added.
Cuz Lightyear, a longtime friend and collaborator, recalled realizing in the studio that it was the first time he had seen Killer Mike recording from a place of freedom and happiness. "He never got to have that moment as a solo artist, where his back wasn't against the wall and he wasn't creating out of desperation," Lightyear said. "For the first time, we were going to do it right. If it ain't for money, you can get on an album and tell the truth."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mike's truth just happened to come with contradictions. In addition to guest appearances by Goodie Mob's Cee-Lo Green and the reclusive Andre 3000 of Outkast, "Michael" also features Young Thug and Mozzy, both of whom are currently incarcerated on weapons charges.
"It's a reflection of Black masculinity at this moment, of who we are and what we are," Mike said. "I'm not different than Mozzy or Thug. I'm not above them. That's part of the misunderstanding or disconnect with me. People would like for me to pick the safety of backpack or being a conscious rapper. I've never not been honest with you, but I didn't understand how to give you a balanced representation of me. I let the market dictate which me you saw."
Mike believes it is no coincidence that his clarity of vision and greatest blessings came only after his grandmother and mother left this earth. With his ancestors working on his behalf, he said, "Everything has opened up and blossomed."
Now, he thinks back to the late nights when he would pull up unannounced in Denise's driveway, and they would sit on his truck bed, stare into the sky and talk for hours.
"I remember her literally telling me, 'You think my mama's your mama. But that's my mama. And one day when I die, you're going to understand"' -- to comprehend what it took for a 16-year-old girl to step aside and let her mother raise her son. "To be judged like that, to be villainized," he said. "Goddamn, girl."
He gets it now, looking at the family and career he has built on that intricate foundation. "People always say to me, you've got so much going on, you're always running," Mike said. "But I just feel like I've got something to do. I don't know where the journey's taking me, but I know God got me on a journey. I've got a purpose, and I'd be a fool not to see it all the way through."

Rushdie Appears at PEN Gala: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The novelist, who was stabbed and gravely wounded at a literary event last year, received an award from the freedom of expression organization.
Salman Rushdie walked onstage at PEN America's annual gala on Thursday night, his first public appearance since he was stabbed and gravely wounded in an attack last August at a literary event in Western New York.
His appearance at the gala, which had not been announced, was a surprise. But no surprise, to those who know him, was that he began his speech with a joke.
"Well, hi everybody," Rushdie said, as the crowd at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan greeted him with whoops and a standing ovation. "It's nice to be back -- as opposed to not being back, which was also an option. I'm pretty glad the dice rolled this way."
His remarks, just a few minutes long, in accepting an award for courage may have been uncharacteristically terse. But Rushdie, who lost sight in one eye because of the attack, was his voluble self during the cocktail hour, for which he had slipped in through a side door before taking his place for a red-carpet photo op.
Flashbulbs popped. And as the crowd began to notice him, friends headed over for handshakes and hugs.
"I just thought if there's a right thing to choose as a re-entry, it's this," he said in an interview. "It's being part of the world of books, the fight against censorship and for human rights."
The evening marked a triumphant return for a man who had not let the lingering threat from the Iranian government's 1989 fatwa get in the way of being an exuberant fixture on the social scene of New York. But if the attack last year came as a shocking blast from the past, the gala underscored the high stakes of the current moment, where freedom of expression is under siege on many fronts, across the political spectrum, not just abroad but at home.
Over the past two years, PEN America has staked out a leading role in the fight against the spread of "educational gag orders," as the organization calls laws restricting teaching on race, gender and other topics, as well as against book bans. This week, the group joined with Penguin Random House to file a lawsuit against a school district in Escambia County, Fla., arguing that its restrictions on books violate the Constitution.
But PEN America has also steered its way through increasingly pitched battles over the value of free speech itself. "Free speech" has become a rallying cry for many conservatives, including those imposing book bans. At the same time, some progressives, including younger ones, dismiss "free speech" as a tool of the powerful and support calls to "deplatform" speakers and works they find offensive.
"We see free speech threatened on all sides, from the left and the right," Suzanne Nossel, who has been PEN America's chief executive since 2013, said in an interview before the gala. "People question it, they don't believe in it, they doubt it. But this is a really important time to shore it up as a cultural and constitutional value. That's part of what the gala does."
The gala itself has been affected by the complexities of the current moment. Ted Sarandos, the co-chief executive of Netflix, who last year invoked freedom of expression in defending the polarizing comedy specials of Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais on the streaming service, had been set to receive an award recognizing his commitment to literary adaptations. But he withdrew last week, citing the continuing Hollywood writers' strike.
And earlier this week, the journalist Masha Gessen resigned as vice president of PEN America's board after a dispute over a panel at the recent PEN World Voices Festival featuring exiled Russian writers. The panel was canceled following a boycott threat from Ukrainian writers.
In her opening remarks, Nossel addressed the controversy head-on.
"As a free speech organization, we must go to the utmost lengths to avoid sidelining speech or being seen to do so," she said. "We should have found a better approach."
During the dinner under the museum's 94-foot blue whale, the mood was festive but pointed.
The comedian Colin Jost, a head writer on "Saturday Night Live" and the co-anchor of its Weekend Update segment, got things started with a joke acknowledging the surprise guest. "Nothing puts you at ease at an event like seeing Salman Rushdie," he said to titters.
Not to worry, he said, there were snipers in the balcony. "But that's just in case a drag queen tries to read a child a story."
Later, there was an award to Lorne Michaels, the creator and longtime executive producer of "Saturday Night Live." PEN America recognized him for what it called "four decades of biting satire that has captured the tenor of the moment, probing the norms, restrictions and absurdities of our institutions and the powerful."
Satire -- and the right of comedians to offend -- has become an increasingly charged issue in the United States. But the moral center of the evening was the struggle against government repression.
The annual Freedom to Write award went to Narges Mohammadi, an Iranian writer and human rights advocate who has been in and out of prison over the past decade. She is currently in Evin Prison in Tehran on charges of "spreading propaganda" and has been subjected to "prolonged solitary confinement and intense psychological torture," according to PEN America.
Mohammadi's husband, the journalist and activist Taghi Rahmani, who lives in Paris and has also been jailed in Iran, accepted the award on her behalf. (Of the 52 jailed writers who have received the award, PEN said, 46 were subsequently released in part because of the group's efforts to highlight their cases.)
In a written message, which was read from the stage, Mohammadi called for an end to Iran's "misogynist, oppressive and theocratic" regime. And she spoke of a fellow writer, Baktash Abtin, who died in prison of Covid last January, as well as of two men who had been charged with insulting the Prophet Muhammad and hanged.
"Don't be mistaken," Mohammadi said in the statement. "They had not written a book. They had not published an article. They had only exchanged a few messages on a Telegram chat room."
The issue of the harms of free expression -- and how to balance them against the right to speak -- has been a fraught issue within PEN America itself. Before its 2015 gala, six members withdrew as literary hosts in protest of a Freedom of Expression Courage Award to the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, on the grounds that the award honored a magazine that published racist and Islamophobic cartoons.
At the time, Rushdie offered tart words for his fellow writers, saying, "I hope nobody ever comes after them." This year, Rushdie received the same award.
He was introduced on Thursday by the playwright and novelist Ayad Akhtar, PEN America's president, who spoke of growing up in a conservative Muslim community in Milwaukee. As a devout young man, Akhtar said, he "knew," even without reading it, that Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," which had prompted the fatwa, was a dangerous and immoral book.
But after reading it, Akhtar (who writes extensively about the experience in his novel "Homeland Elegies") wept. To say that reading "The Satanic Verses" transformed him, he said, was an understatement.
The attack on Rushdie, Akhtar said, had been a "profound and galvanizing moment for us at PEN" and decisively answered what for him had been a lingering, unresolved question.
"Is the harm caused by offensive speech a claim on us with equal weight as the freedom to speak, the freedom to imagine?" he said. "The answer is: Of course not. Of course not."
After a short tribute video, the room went dark. And then Rushdie appeared.
It was an emotional moment. But it was not, Rushdie emphasized, only about him.
Rushdie, a former PEN America president, praised the group's efforts on behalf of teachers, libraries and authors. And he hailed those who had rushed to restrain his attacker at the Chautauqua Institution last August and saved his life.
"I was the target that day, but they were the heroes," Rushdie said. "The courage that day was all theirs."
"Terrorism must not terrorize us," he continued. "Violence must not deter us. As the old Marxists used to say, La lutte continue. La lutta continua. The struggle goes on."

NEW YORK — Salman Rushdie walked onstage at PEN America’s annual gala Thursday night, his first public appearance since he was stabbed and gravely wounded in an attack in August at a literary event in western New York.

But after reading it, Akhtar (who writes extensively about the experience in his novel “Homeland Elegies”) wept. To say that reading “The Satanic Verses” transformed him, he said, was an understatement.
The attack on Rushdie, Akhtar said, had been a “profound and galvanizing moment for us at PEN” and decisively answered what for him had been a lingering, unresolved question.
“Is the harm caused by offensive speech a claim on us with equal weight as the freedom to speak, the freedom to imagine?” he said. “The answer is: Of course not. Of course not.”
After a short tribute video, the room went dark. And then Rushdie appeared.
It was an emotional moment. But it was not, Rushdie emphasized, only about him.
Rushdie, a former PEN America president, praised the group’s efforts on behalf of teachers, libraries and authors. And he hailed those who had rushed to restrain his attacker at the Chautauqua Institution in August and saved his life.
“I was the target that day, but they were the heroes,” Rushdie said. “The courage that day was all theirs.”
“Terrorism must not terrorize us,” he continued. “Violence must not deter us. As the old Marxists used to say, La lutte continue. La lutta continua. The struggle goes on.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In "Yellowface," R.F. Kuang draws on her own experiences to tackle issues like cultural appropriation and representation. "I hate the feeling of being read just because somebody's trying to tick off a diversity check box," she says.
Everything about R.F. Kuang's novel "Yellowface" feels engineered to make readers uncomfortable. There's the title, which is awkward to say out loud, and the cover, which features a garish racial stereotype -- cartoonish slanted eyes imposed on a block of yellow.
Then there's the story itself. In the opening chapters, a white author steals a manuscript from the home of a Chinese American novelist who has died in a bizarre accident, and plots to pass it off as her own. What follows is a twisty thriller and a scorching indictment of the publishing industry's pervasive whiteness and racial blind spots.
If people in the literary world bristle at Kuang's withering depiction of the book business -- or cringe in recognition -- well, that's exactly the point, she said.
"Reading about racism should not be a feel-good experience," she said. "I do want people to be uncomfortable with the way that they're trained to write about and market and sell books, and be uncomfortable with who's in the room, and how they're talking about who's in the room.
"And it's also functioning on a different level for writers of color," she added, "to think about how we are moving through those spaces, and the traps that are set for us."
Kuang, a best-selling fantasy writer and doctoral student in East Asian languages and literatures at Yale, said this while sitting in a sunny office at the headquarters of her publisher, HarperCollins. It was late April, and she had just signed 2,000 copies of "Yellowface" -- which William Morrow, a HarperCollins imprint, will release on Tuesday -- to ship to 250 independent bookstores. The location was oddly fitting for a conversation in which Kuang pondered how her novel might be received within the industry she brutally satirizes.
Judging from the largely ecstatic early responses to the novel, the literary world seems to enjoy being skewered. HarperCollins bought the book for a mid-six-figure sum, and is sending Kuang on a 10-city North American tour. Barnes & Noble is releasing a special edition of the novel, with an essay about Asian American representation in literature by Kuang. Independent booksellers have chosen it as their top "Indie Next" pick for June.
The novel has drawn praise from industry outlets like Booklist, Publishers Weekly and Kirkus, which lauded Kuang's unflinching accuracy: "Yes, publishing is like this; finally someone has written it out."
"I laughed out loud and also groaned," said Zakiya Dalila Harris, who drew on her own experience as a Black woman working in publishing for her novel, "The Other Black Girl." "It felt so real and triggering."
The book stirred discomfort from the start. When Kuang sent the first 100 pages to Hannah Bowman, her literary agent, Bowman at first tried to dissuade her from pursuing the project, warning that nobody would want to publish it.
"We did have a conversation where I said, 'There are things in here that I am afraid could offend people you work with,"' Bowman recalled.
After Kuang insisted, Bowman sent it out, and was pleasantly surprised by the enthusiastic responses. "For publishing insiders, it's just catnip, it's so dishy about the industry," Bowman said. "Everyone who's read it has said, 'This is saying something that needs to be said."'
Within HarperCollins, there was brief, awkward debate about whether some might see "Yellowface" as a not so subtle critique of the company.
"There was a lot of conversation on our side of, 'Oh my God, she's writing this takedown of publishing, is it going to be a problem for Harper?"' said May Chen, who acquired and edited the book, and noted that parts of the narrative rang painfully true to her as a Chinese American publishing executive. "We're like 'Wow, does she like us?"'
For Kuang -- who at 26 has built a devoted following for her deeply researched and thought provoking fantasy novels -- publishing a scorched-earth satirical takedown of the publishing industry was creatively and professionally risky. She's keenly aware of how she has benefited from publishing's hype machine, with its social media marketing campaigns and breathless book deal announcements on industry websites. At the same time, she has started to chafe at the ways in which she and her work have been promoted and sometimes pigeonholed as "diverse."
"I have participated in all of this, but I'm also starting to get very tired of it," she said. "It's not just people who think you don't deserve your audience or your place in publishing who will say, 'Well, you're only there because you're a token diverse author.' You also get this rhetoric from people who are trying to support marginalized voices," she continued. "I hate the feeling of being read just because somebody's trying to tick off a diversity check box."
Kuang, whose parents immigrated to Texas from Guangzhou, China, when she was 4, started writing her first novel as a way to reconnect with her family's culture and history.
While studying history at Georgetown University, Kuang took a year off and went to live in Beijing, and began writing episodes of a fantasy story that she sent to her father. Those chapters became her debut novel, "The Poppy War," a martial arts-infused Chinese military history that drew on the Second Sino-Japanese War. She sold it to HarperVoyager as part of a trilogy, and it was nominated for the 2019 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel.
At the same time her fiction career was taking off, Kuang immersed herself in Chinese history and language, and got master's degrees in Chinese studies from Cambridge and Oxford. She loved the camaraderie and the erudite atmosphere, but was uncomfortable with the elitist culture of academia. The experience inspired her fourth novel, "Babel," a historical fantasy set in mid-1800s Oxford, about a powerful group of translators who can wield language like a magic spell.
Like the "Poppy War" trilogy, "Babel" used fantasy tropes to examine complex themes: the impact of colonialism and racism, and the way elite institutions drive social inequality. The book hit the New York Times best-seller list, and went on to sell some 350,000 copies.
Kuang had just turned in the manuscript for "Babel" when she got the idea for "Yellowface" in early 2021. It was a few months after protests had erupted following the police killing of George Floyd, and publishing, along with other industries, was wrestling with issues of diversity and representation. Kuang was skeptical that those conversations would lead to action. "A lot of promises were made and a lot of goals were set, and I think that very few of those promises have been kept," she said.
It was easy for Kuang to conjure the caustic, blithely racist voice of her narrator, June Hayward -- a struggling novelist who is consumed by bitterness toward her former classmate Athena Liu, an industry darling who writes best-selling novels that draw on Chinese culture and history. In June's warped view, Athena only succeeded because publishers wanted an Asian American author on their list.
"I've been living with June's voice in my head for a really long time," Kuang said. "You start internalizing a lot of the insecurity and doubt about your place in the room. I'm constantly questioning, like, do I deserve the space I'm taking up? Do I deserve this audience?"
After Athena dies suddenly in June's presence, choking on pancakes while drunkenly celebrating a Netflix deal, June steals Athena's work in progress, a novel about Chinese laborers who were sent by the British to the Allied Front during World War I. She sends it out as her own, and publishers swoon: June gets the six-figure advance and spot on the best-seller list that she feels she deserves.
She's also unsettled by accusations that she was profiting from the pain of Chinese laborers and guilty of cultural appropriation, and is haunted by an anonymous account on Twitter that accuses her of stealing Athena's work.
June's publisher tries to head off scandal. A book publicist gently prods her about her ethnic heritage -- "You're not ... anything else?" the publicist asks after clarifying that June isn't Asian. A Korean American editorial assistant suggests that June hire a sensitivity reader to make sure her depiction of Chinese workers isn't offensive. June refuses, and then gets slammed by critics for being "inauthentic."
While writing the first draft in a feverish few months, Kuang drew on her own insecurities and experience of being an Asian American author in an overwhelmingly white industry.
"With Athena, I'm trying to work through my worst nightmares about what I could become," she said. "She is that token Asian author who is prized because of her ability to be a cultural broker. And because her career is founded on being the one who is able to explain Chinese history, Chinese Americans, to white readers, she's also very threatened by any other Chinese American writer in the room. "
Kuang seems to be reveling in the irony that a major corporate publisher is releasing such an unsparing takedown of the industry. In late February, she posted a video on TikTok and Instagram, in which she smiles innocently, hugging a copy of "Yellowface," with a caption that says "HarperCollins: Sure we'll publish that satire you wrote about the publishing industry we're sure you didn't say anything mean about us."
For Kuang, who is under contract to publish three more novels with HarperCollins, writing about her worst professional anxieties has been like an exorcism of sorts.
"Part of what made me write 'Yellowface' was I finally had to trap it down on the page," she said. "Now all that nastiness is between the covers."

Kuang knows that her fifth novel, "Yellowface," might make some readers uneasy, and that's the point: "Reading about racism should not be a feel-good experience," she said.

The Florida Man Of Formula 1: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Logan Sargeant, the only American driver in Formula 1, is zipping around the narrow streets of Baku, Azerbaijan, at roughly 200 miles an hour. His head bounces inside the cockpit as a wheel shudders over a rumble strip. It's hard to hear over the banshee shriek of his V6 engine, carrying three times the horsepower of a run-of-the-mill Porsche Carrera.
Then the noise stops, and Baku vanishes. We're inside a low-slung brick building nestled in the Oxfordshire countryside. The track, projected onto a CinemaScope-sized wraparound screen, was a mirage, part of a sophisticated training simulator. (F1 rules prohibit driving the real cars between races.) Mr. Sargeant climbs out of a replica driver's seat wearing athletic pants. He won't need a fireproof suit until later.
In three weeks' time, Mr. Sargeant will do this for real: wind whipping his visor, G-forces of up to six times his body weight pressing on his neck, the ever-present threat of a catastrophic crash as he is watched by roughly 70 million people around the world. For now, it's time for lunch. "Is chili bad for you?" he asks, digging into a bowl at his team's commissary. "I don't think it's that bad."
Reaching Formula 1, the highest level of international motor sport, is a big step for Mr. Sargeant, 22, a South Florida native who began racing rudimentary cars known as karts at 6 years old and this year joined the Williams Racing team as the first full-time American F1 driver since 2007.
For Formula 1 itself, finding a hometown hero for American fans is a giant leap.
Although it is enormously popular in Europe, F1 struggled for decades to break into the United States. That began to change in 2016, when the sport was purchased for $ 4.4 billion by the Colorado-based Liberty Media, owned by the cable magnate John Malone. Liberty ramped up its social media -- F1 had barely kept a YouTube page -- and backed a popular Netflix documentary series, "Drive to Survive." Once geared toward aging white men, F1 now has a younger and more diverse fan base. American TV viewership is up 220 percent from 2018, and the sport made $ 2.6 billion in revenue last year.
Still, a subset of F1 devotees complain about what they see as an overemphasis on entertainment and ginned-up drama. Under Liberty, they argue, pure racing is taking a back seat to cheap tricks to reel in casual viewers. And they often use a dirty word for it: Americanization. "It is becoming more and more like Formula Hollywood," Bernie Ecclestone, the 92-year-old Briton who built F1 into a global business, griped last year. "F1 is being made more and more for the American market."
The backlash reached a crescendo at last week's Miami Grand Prix, which was added in 2022 as a showpiece for American fans. In a prizefight-style pre-race ceremony, the rapper LL Cool J introduced the 20 drivers one by one amid swirling smoke and a squad of cheerleaders. Nearby, Will.i.am conducted a live orchestra playing the rap song he recently recorded with Lil Wayne as part of a "global music collaboration" with Formula 1. (The lyrics rhyme "Max Verstappen," the name of the sport's top driver, with "your champion.")
"Pandering to the American audience is killing @F1," wrote one fan on Twitter, echoing criticism that bubbled up across numerous F1 websites. Even the racers complained: "None of the drivers like it," groused Lando Norris, a Briton who drives for McLaren. Undeterred, Liberty announced that the bombastic pre-race sequence would be featured at several more grands prix this year.
In the United States, F1 has long been associated with a certain European mystique. Its drivers race across the Ardennes forest (Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium), the plains of Lombardy (Italy's Autodromo Nazionale di Monza) and, most famously, the louche glamour of the Monaco Grand Prix. The sport's stateside image could be summed up by the 2006 comedy, "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as a pretentious French F1 driver named Jean Girard, a snooty Eurotrash foil to Will Ferrell's macho NASCAR cowboy.
In 2023, F1 can feel a bit more Ricky Bobby than Jean Girard. In Miami, drivers circled a track built in the parking lot of the Dolphins football stadium, past an artificial Monaco-style "harbor": blue-painted asphalt topped with ersatz yachts. A new Las Vegas race in November will have cars zooming down the Strip past Caesars Palace. Meanwhile, traditional races in France and Germany are gone.
Katy Fairman, a journalist based in Brighton, England, who runs the F1 podcast "Small Torque," said she was surprised by the spectacle when she attended a race in Austin, Texas. "There were girls with pompoms," she said. "I remember watching it and thinking, Oh my gosh, this is so different from anything I'd seen F1 do in a long time."
Ms. Fairman conceded that some Europeans find the American hullabaloo "tacky." But she added: "When it's something to do with America, I think Europeans are quite judgmental. I think it's just a bit of lighthearted fun. You guys like to have a party."
The arrival of Mr. Sargeant, who grew up about an hour's drive from the Miami racetrack, has spurred new interest, including a profile and photo shoot in GQ, and he's happy to play the part. "What's up America, let's bring that energy!" he shouted to the cameras after LL Cool J introduced him as "the local boy done good."
But as with F1, there are growing pains. In Miami, Mr. Sargeant finished last, his race ruined on the first lap when he damaged a front wing. After the checkered flag, he apologized to his team, his voice barely a whisper: "I'm so sorry. I can't believe it."
Weeks earlier, in an interview in England, Mr. Sargeant had demurred about the pressure of wearing the stars and stripes. "I try not to get too caught up in the talk of the role of 'first American,"' he said. "It's still very early for me, and I have a lot to learn still."
If Mr. Sargeant doesn't perform, there are dozens of drivers eager to take his spot. "At the moment," he said, "I just have to worry about staying here."
'I just want to get back in the gym.'
Before his tough Miami weekend, Mr. Sargeant was asked how he would celebrate a top 10 finish. "Honestly, it might sound lame, but probably just go back to my house and get in my bed for another night before I go back to London," he replied. "That's all I want to do."
For a wealthy, handsome, globe-trotting athlete, Mr. Sargeant can be soft-spoken and endearingly self-conscious. It's not unusual for someone who, like a tennis prodigy or Olympian gymnast, has devoted their life since childhood to a sole pursuit.
Mr. Sargeant was 6 when he and his brother Dalton got a kart from their parents for Christmas. "No one in the family was really even that much into racing," Logan said. "We just picked it up as a hobby, something to do on the weekend." He began winning junior races around the country -- too easily. To reach the next level and pursue Formula 1, he'd have to leave behind his friends and beloved fishing excursions for life on a different continent: "We just needed a higher level of competition, and at the end of the day, that was in Europe."
Mr. Sargeant left Florida before his 13th birthday, bouncing between Italy, Switzerland and Britain as he raced on the European junior circuit; in 2015, he became the first American to win the Karting World Championship since 1978. "As a kid, it was tough," he recalled. "Coming from Florida, being outdoors all the time on the water, great weather -- it was literally vice versa." He eventually settled in London, where he spends most days working out with a trainer. "I get away from a race weekend, and I just want to get back in the gym," he said. "I hate that feeling of leaving slack on the table."
It is incredibly difficult to nab a seat in Formula 1. Today's drivers are physical dynamos trained to optimize their reflexes and performance levels down to how well they can withstand jet lag -- critical in a sport that this year will include 23 grands prix spread over five continents. F1 teams employ hundreds of employees and spend hundreds of millions of dollars developing the world's most sophisticated racecars. But it's ultimately up to the driver to execute.
It also helps to have money. Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time world champion and F1's only Black driver, is an exception, having grown up on a London council estate. Many F1 competitors are the sons of multimillionaires (and some billionaires) who can bankroll pricey travel and high-tech cars.
Mr. Sargeant falls into the scion category. He hails from a wealthy Florida asphalt shipping family. His uncle, Harry Sargeant III, is a former fighter pilot and onetime finance chair of Florida's Republican Party who has been sued by the brother-in-law of King Abdullah II of Jordan and whose name turned up, tangentially, in the 2020 impeachment of former President Donald J. Trump. (Harry was not accused of any wrongdoing.)
Logan's father, Daniel Sargeant, worked alongside Harry until the brothers had a falling out. In a 2013 lawsuit, Harry accused Daniel of misdirecting $ 6.5 million in corporate funds "for the purpose of advancing the international cart racing activities" of his sons, Logan and Dalton; that litigation was eventually settled.
In 2019, Daniel Sargeant pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to foreign bribery and money laundering charges related to his business dealings abroad. He is free on a $ 5 million bond and is awaiting sentencing. A Williams spokesman said that Logan Sargeant was not "in a position to comment" on any of the legal matters involving his family.
In F1, none of this particularly stands out. The mother of Mr. Sargeant's Williams teammate, Alexander Albon, was jailed in Britain for swindling millions of pounds in fraudulent sales of high-end cars. A Russian racer, Nikita Mazepin, was booted from the sport after his oligarch father, a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, was sanctioned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
James Vowles, the Williams team principal, said in an interview that he hired Mr. Sargeant for his speed, not his U.S. passport. "I'm incredibly pleased that the sport is growing in America, but I think it would be anything but disingenuous to say that Logan's here for any other reason than I think he's got this pure talent," he said.
In his F1 debut in Bahrain in March, Mr. Sargeant finished 12th, outpacing this year's two other rookies. "He has this insatiable desire to be better, to want more," Mr. Vowles said. "He's a perfectionist, and I like that in him."
Tooting around in a Vauxhall Astra
Britain, where Formula 1 originated in 1950, remains the sport's spiritual home, where most of its 10 teams are based. Williams was founded in Oxfordshire in the 1970s, but it's now an American subsidiary: a Manhattan private equity firm, Dorilton Capital, bought the company in 2020 for an estimated $ 200 million.
It was an important cash infusion for a team that had struggled to keep up with rivals. Manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz pour enormous resources into their F1 teams, which double as an elaborate global marketing campaign and an in-house innovation farm; tech developed for F1, like engines that recycle braking energy as an accelerant, can trickle into consumer vehicles.
The Williams campus is a humdrum brick pile that could be mistaken for an office park -- a far cry from McLaren's space-age complex an hour's drive away. Many F1 teams provide their drivers with a high-end sports car for personal use; Mr. Sargeant commutes in a Vauxhall Astra, a compact.
Even the team's sponsors are relatively down-market; whereas the official watch of Ferrari is Richard Mille (starting price: $ 60,000), Williams has a deal with Bremont, whose timepieces retail for significantly less. (On a recent visit, a Williams press aide was quick to extract a spare Bremont watch from his pocket and ensure Mr. Sargeant was wearing it whenever a photographer hovered.)
Given the huge costs, corporate partnerships are crucial to F1, part of the reason the American market, with its abundance of affluent consumers and wealthy brands, has proved so tempting. Gerald Donaldson, a journalist who has covered F1 for 45 years, recalled how cars were gradually taken over by corporate logos starting in the late 1960s.
"Marlboro paid all the Ferrari bills, including the drivers, for many years," he said in an interview. "There are eager companies who want the publicity." Mr. Sargeant's car features ads for Michelob Ultra beer and an American financial firm, Stephens. In Miami last weekend, beachgoers spotted an airborne banner reading "Go Logan!" alongside the image of a Duracell battery.
Last year, the Miami race was viewed on ABC by 2.6 million people, the biggest American audience for a live F1 telecast. Ratings for this year's race fell about 25 percent, perhaps a result of a duller-than-usual season dominated by one team, Red Bull.
Still, viewing data show that F1 is expanding beyond affluent cities associated with elite sports: In 2022, its top five American TV markets included Asheville, N.C., and Tulsa, Okla. ESPN is clearly betting on more growth. When the sports network renewed its broadcast rights last year, it agreed to pay $ 90 million annually -- up from the $ 5 million-a-year deal it signed in 2019.
Liam Parker, a former adviser to Boris Johnson who now leads communications at F1, said the sport was intent on rectifying past mistakes. "We were too arrogant," he said. "We couldn't understand why the American fan base wasn't falling in love with us." But he also pushed back on the complaints that Liberty's efforts to raise the entertainment factor had stripped F1 of something essential.
"This whole argument of 'Americanization,' it's a very crude way to describe things," he said. "We shouldn't ignore things that can improve things for new and core fans. It's about giving people more choices in the modern era. It's modernization of access to everyone."
Mr. Hamilton, arguably the biggest celebrity of the current F1 lineup, has offered his own endorsement of Liberty's approach. "I mean jeez, I grew up listening to LL Cool J," he told reporters in Miami. "I thought it was cool, wasn't an issue to me."
For all the debates over elitism, good taste and corporate rap collaborations, the core appeal of F1, when you get right down to it, may be something simpler -- something Mr. Sargeant got at when asked in the interview if he had loved cars as a kid.
"I absolutely love driving, as you can imagine," he said. "But to be honest, I'm not one of those people who studies cars and, you know, likes to know every detail of every single car. It doesn't really interest me."
"The part that interests me," he concluded, "is driving them as fast as I can go."

Fans Adopt a Mother as the Spirit Moves Them: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Online, practically every famous woman is "mother," a term with deep ties to the L.G.B.T.Q. ballroom community.
To many people on the internet, the actress Toni Collette is known simply as "mother."
Ms. Collette has played more than her share of mothers throughout her career: a matriarch with dissociative identity disorder on the TV show "United States of Tara"; a miniatures artist whose family is haunted after the death of her own mother in the film "Hereditary"; and, more recently, an American mom charged with taking over her Italian family's mob business in the movie "Mafia Mamma."
But Ms. Collette is not necessarily called mother for playing fictional ones, or even for being a mother in real life. Instead, fans have bestowed the title as a way to express their appreciation.
When fans call her mother, which they often do, "it feels like a well-intended, collective, familial, warm hug," Ms. Collette said in an email. She is just one of the many female celebrities who, if lacking a proper understanding of the word's new use, might wonder why they suddenly have so many children.
Mother is everywhere. The slang term -- without an article in front -- is used by fans, brands and sometimes even mothers themselves. It derives from the Black and Latino L.G.B.T.Q. ballroom scene, a queer subculture in which members are organized into so-called houses often led by a "mother." The word's current use, however, veers campier and is mostly used as a term of endearment for famous women with avid devotees. Its popularity has a precedent in the late 2010s, when seemingly every male celebrity was called "daddy," a term used to describe good-looking older men.
But in 2023, daddy is dead: Long live mother. Mother's ballads raised you; mother's widely panned performances gave you life; and mother's mothering mothered so hard that you must show her the respect she deserves. To do so, call her mother.
According to the internet, mother is Mariah Carey, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Adele, the K-pop group Blackpink and Diana, Princess of Wales. She is also Jennifer Lopez, who stars in the film "The Mother" and who was certainly mother in the 2019 film "Hustlers"; she is the character Shiv Roy, played by Sarah Snook on the prestige hit "Succession"; she is even the Elkay water-bottle-filling station, which can help you avoid spending $ 5 on an overpriced bottle of water at the airport.
Who is and isn't mother is subjective, of course. Juan Camilo Velásquez, 30, a writer who lives in New York City, considers Lana Del Rey to be mother. "I think she's an amazing singer and songwriter," he said, adding that her music struck him as "timeless but very contemporary."
But for Cameron Columbia, Ms. Del Rey isn't mother. "I would never hate on anybody, but like, I've never really gotten into Lana Del Rey," said Mr. Columbia, 23, a student from Long Island. "My all-time mother would be Ariana Grande."
Brandon Walker, 23, who works in insurance and lives in Louisville, Ky., said he called people mother because of "the ways they've influenced the pop culture sphere or how they had an effect on me." As a Black gay boy growing up in the South, he felt that mothers like Beyoncé, Rihanna and Nicki Minaj helped him express himself.
"Mother is fundamentally a female figure who raised you through a period in your life," said Mr. Walker, who also counts Ms. Collette among his mothers. Calling a woman mother is also a way of "paying homage to them for the work they've put in their respective industry," he said.
Mother dates to the 1970s in the New York ballroom scene, which was created in response to racism in the drag and pageant community. These spaces often created surrogate family structures for marginalized L.G.B.T.Q. people of color.
According to Sydney Baloue, a member of the House of Xtravaganza who is writing a book on the history of ballroom and vogueing, "the first mother of ballroom" was Crystal LaBeija. Many in the ballroom community say the scene's current iteration began in 1972, he said, when Ms. LaBeija helped to found the first house, the House of LaBeija.
Ms. LaBeija, a Black drag performer and transgender woman, was the catalyst for our current cultural moment, according to Mr. Baloue, who was a co-executive producer of the ballroom competition show "Legendary." If you're mother, "you're the one who's won the most trophies, you're the one who's the most prominent member," he said. "You also do a lot of taking care of the kids."
Mother, who can be of any gender, "evolved out of these communities who have had to recreate or rethink what actual mothering and family are" after being ostracized from their biological families, said Marlon M. Bailey, a professor of African and African American studies at Washington University in St. Louis who wrote a book chronicling ballroom culture in Detroit.
Ms. Collette suspects that a lack of maternal affection may be why her fans, many of whom are L.G.B.T.Q., call her mother. "I don't want to get too deep about such a sweet gesture, but it may also indicate a large need for parental acceptance and love," she wrote. "Not everyone had or has the healthiest relationship with their mom. Having played so many different women with kids, I may have come to represent or fill a social media gap of what is lacking for so many people."
Still, she added, "It may also just simply be because of the 'I am your mother' speech in 'Hereditary.' It's a ripper."
On "RuPaul's Drag Race," Mr. Baloue said, contestants "suck up anything from ballroom," repeat it and, in turn, popularize a word that "doesn't always get passed properly." RuPaul has embraced the term, releasing the song "Call Me Mother" in 2017. Viewers often hear the word and adopt it, whether or not they are using the proper context.
Mr. Baloue thinks the term "mother" makes sense for some figures outside the ballroom community. "When there are those Black diva figures who we admire, like Diana Ross or Patti LaBelle or Chaka Khan," he said, "there's also a way that we refer to them as mother because not only did they nurture us with their music and their cultural contribution, but they fed us in a kind of way."
"Mother" further entered broader culture thanks to the show "Pose," which debuted in 2018 and was set in the 1980s New York ballroom scene. It features the actress Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, who plays the mother of the fictional House of Evangelista.
Ms. Rodriquez said being able to play a ballroom mother was an honor, joy and serious responsibility, adding that she found the term's newfound popularity "beautiful."
"I think anyone should be able to use a term that is trending," she said, stressing "it's important to know where that term has derived from, which is the Philadelphia and New York City ballroom culture."
Ms. Rodriguez cautioned that there were "boundaries" to adopting a new term with deep historical connections to a marginalized community: "The boundaries are knowing where it came from, always letting the world know where the culture came from."
Those boundaries become blurred when a term, once popular online, finds its way into brand copy. Mr. Baloue sees the corporate embrace of mother as almost inevitable. "Black culture is American culture and it ends up informing everything," he said.
After seeing Variety tweet that "Jennifer Lopez is mother" and BuzzFeed UK say the "Yellowjackets" star Melanie Lynskey was "so MOTHER," Professor Bailey said he found himself troubled. "It's about marketing identities and practices, and appropriating cultural formations like the ballroom community," he said, "without attending to the conditions out of which ballroom was created in the first place."
Enter Meghan Trainor, who has embraced the term mother to the nth degree.
Ms. Trainor, who is pregnant with her second child, released her song "Mother" in March, singing: "I am your mother. You listen to me." The song's music video -- which came out shortly before Ms. Trainor published "Dear Future Mama," a guide to new motherhood -- even stars Kris Jenner, "momager" extraordinaire, and opens with a voice declaring that Ms. Trainor is "literally mother." (Through a publicist, Ms. Trainor declined to be interviewed for this article.)
The song and accompanying video was "a show of how the term had lost all meaning," Mr. Velásquez said. "We've reached the point where if you become the best at being bad, then you become the mother of being the opposite of mother," he said.
Ms. Rodriguez, who knows Ms. Trainor and loves the song "Mother," said she liked how the singer played on the term's duality. "I think how she's using the term, it's right for her, and she can use it in any way she wants to."
She added: "How the world perceives it is how the world perceives it."

The Florida Man of Formula One

GROVE, England — Logan Sargeant, the only American driver in Formula One, is zipping around the narrow streets of Baku, Azerbaijan, at roughly 200 mph. His head bounces inside the cockpit as a wheel shudders over a rumble strip. It’s hard to hear over the banshee shriek of his V-6 engine, carrying three times the horsepower of a run-of-the-mill Porsche Carrera.
Then the noise stops, and Baku vanishes. We’re inside a low-slung brick building nestled in the Oxfordshire countryside. The track, projected onto a CinemaScope-size wraparound screen, was a mirage, part of a sophisticated training simulator. (F1 rules prohibit driving the real cars between races.) Sargeant climbs out of a replica driver’s seat wearing athletic pants. He won’t need a fireproof suit until later.
In three weeks, Sargeant will do this for real: wind whipping his visor, G-forces of up to six times his body weight pressing on his neck, the ever-present threat of a catastrophic crash as he is watched by roughly 70 million people around the world. For now, it’s time for lunch. “Is chili bad for you?” he asks, digging into a bowl at the team commissary. “I don’t think it’s that bad.”
Reaching Formula One, the highest level of international motor sports, is a big step for Sargeant, 22, a South Florida native who began racing rudimentary cars known as karts at age 6 and this year joined the Williams Racing team as the first full-time American F1 driver since 2007.
For Formula One itself, finding a hometown hero for American fans is a giant leap.
Although it is hugely popular in Europe, F1 struggled for decades to break into the United States. That began to change in 2016, when the sport was purchased for $4.4 billion by Colorado-based Liberty Media, owned by the cable magnate John Malone. Liberty ramped up its social media — F1 had barely kept a YouTube page — and backed a Netflix documentary series, “Drive to Survive.” Once geared toward aging white men, F1 now has a younger and more diverse fan base. American TV viewership is up 220% from 2018, and the sport made $2.6 billion in revenue last year.
Still, a subset of F1 devotees complain about what they see as an overemphasis on entertainment and ginned-up drama. Under Liberty, they argue, pure racing is taking a back seat to cheap tricks to reel in casual viewers. And they often use a dirty word for it: Americanization.
“It is becoming more and more like Formula Hollywood,” Bernie Ecclestone, a 92-year-old Briton who built F1 into a global business, griped last year. “F1 is being made more and more for the American market.”
The backlash reached a peak at last week’s Miami Grand Prix, which was added in 2022 as a showpiece for American fans. In a prizefight-style prerace ceremony, rapper LL Cool J introduced the 20 drivers one by one amid swirling smoke and a squad of cheerleaders. Nearby, Will.i.am conducted a live orchestra playing the rap song he recently recorded with Lil Wayne as part of a “global music collaboration” with Formula One. (The lyrics rhyme “Max Verstappen,” the name of the sport’s top driver, with “your champion.”)
“Pandering to the American audience is killing @F1,” wrote one fan on Twitter, echoing criticism that bubbled up across numerous F1 websites. Even the racers complained. “None of the drivers like it,” groused Lando Norris, a Briton who drives for McLaren. Undeterred, Liberty announced that the bombastic prerace sequence would be featured at several more grand prix this year.
In the United States, F1 has long been associated with a certain European mystique. Its drivers race across the Ardennes forest (Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium), the plains of Lombardy (Italy’s Autodromo Nazionale di Monza) and, most famously, the louche glamour of the Monaco Grand Prix. The sport’s stateside image could be summed up by the 2006 comedy “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as a pretentious French F1 driver named Jean Girard, a snooty Eurotrash foil to Will Ferrell’s macho NASCAR cowboy.
In 2023, F1 can feel a bit more Ricky Bobby than Jean Girard. In Miami, drivers circled a track built in the parking lot of the Dolphins football stadium, past an artificial Monaco-style “harbor”: blue-painted asphalt topped with ersatz yachts. A new Las Vegas race in November will have cars zooming down the Strip past Caesars Palace. Meanwhile, traditional races in France and Germany are gone.
Katy Fairman, a journalist based in Brighton, England, who runs the F1 podcast “Small Torque,” said she was surprised by the spectacle of a race in Texas. “There were girls with pompoms,” she said. “I remember watching it and thinking, ‘Oh, my gosh, this is so different from anything I’d seen F1 do in a long time.’”
Fairman said some Europeans found the American hullabaloo “tacky.” But she added: “When it’s something to do with America, I think Europeans are quite judgmental. I think it’s just a bit of lighthearted fun. You guys like to have a party.”
The arrival of Sargeant, who grew up about an hour’s drive from the Miami racetrack, has spurred new interest, including a profile and photo shoot in GQ, and he’s happy to play the part. “What’s up, America! Let’s bring that energy!” he shouted to the cameras after LL Cool J introduced him as “the local boy done good.”
But as with F1, there are growing pains. In Miami, Sargeant finished last, his race ruined on the first lap when he damaged a front wing. After the checkered flag, he apologized to his team, his voice barely a whisper: “I’m so sorry. I can’t believe it.”
Weeks earlier, in an interview in Britain, Sargeant had demurred about the pressure of wearing the stars and stripes. “I try not to get too caught up in the talk of the role of ‘first American,’” he said. “It’s still very early for me, and I have a lot to learn still.”
If Sargeant doesn’t perform, there are dozens of drivers eager to take his spot. “At the moment,” he said, “I just have to worry about staying here.”
Getting ‘Back in the Gym’
Before his tough Miami weekend, Sargeant was asked how he would celebrate a Top 10 finish. “Honestly, it might sound lame, but probably just go back to my house and get in my bed for another night before I go back to London,” he said. “That’s all I want to do.”
For a wealthy, handsome, globe-trotting athlete, Sargeant can be soft-spoken and endearingly self-conscious. It’s not unusual for someone who, like a tennis prodigy or an Olympian gymnast, has devoted his life since childhood to a sole pursuit.
Sargeant was 6 years old when he and his brother, Dalton, got a kart from their parents for Christmas.
“No one in the family was really even that much into racing,” Sargeant said. “We just picked it up as a hobby, something to do on the weekend.” He began winning junior races around the country — too easily. To reach the next level and pursue Formula One, he’d have to leave behind his friends and beloved fishing trips for life on a different continent. “We just needed a higher level of competition, and at the end of the day, that was in Europe,” he said.
Sargeant left Florida before his 13th birthday, bouncing among Italy, Switzerland and Britain as he raced on the European junior circuit; in 2015, he became the first American to win the Karting World Championship since 1978.
“As a kid, it was tough,” he recalled. “Coming from Florida, being outdoors all the time on the water, great weather — it was literally vice versa.” He settled in London, where he spends most days working out with a trainer. “I get away from a race weekend, and I just want to get back in the gym,” he said. “I hate that feeling of leaving slack on the table.”
It is very difficult to nab a seat in Formula One. Today’s drivers are physical dynamos trained to optimize their reflexes and performance levels down to how well they can withstand jet lag — critical in a sport that this year will include 23 grand prix spread over five continents. F1 teams employ hundreds of employees and spend hundreds of millions of dollars developing the world’s most sophisticated race cars. But it’s ultimately up to the driver to execute.
It also helps to have money. Lewis Hamilton, a seven-time world champion and F1’s only Black driver, is an exception, having grown up on a London council estate. Many F1 competitors are the sons of multimillionaires (and some billionaires) who can bankroll pricey travel and high-tech cars.
Sargeant falls into the scion category. He hails from a wealthy Florida asphalt shipping family. His uncle, Harry Sargeant III, is a former fighter pilot and onetime finance chair of Florida’s Republican Party who has been sued by the brother-in-law of King Abdullah II of Jordan and whose name turned up, tangentially, in the 2020 impeachment of former President Donald Trump. (Harry was not accused of any wrongdoing.)
Logan’s father, Daniel, worked alongside Harry until the brothers had a falling out. In a 2013 lawsuit, Harry accused Daniel of misdirecting $6.5 million in corporate funds “for the purpose of advancing the international cart racing activities” of his sons, Logan and Dalton; that litigation was eventually settled.
In 2019, Daniel Sargeant pleaded guilty in federal court in New York to foreign bribery and money-laundering charges related to his business dealings abroad. He is free on a $5 million bond and is awaiting sentencing. A Williams spokesperson said Logan Sargeant was not “in a position to comment” on any of the legal matters involving his family.
In F1, none of this particularly stands out. The mother of Sargeant’s Williams teammate, Alexander Albon, was jailed in Britain for swindling millions of pounds in fraudulent sales of high-end cars. A Russian racer, Nikita Mazepin, was booted from the sport after his oligarch father, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s, was sanctioned after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
James Vowles, the Williams team principal, said in an interview that he hired Sargeant for his speed, not his U.S. passport. “I’m incredibly pleased that the sport is growing in America, but I think it would be anything but disingenuous to say that Logan’s here for any other reason than I think he’s got this pure talent,” he said.
In his F1 debut in Bahrain in March, Sargeant finished 12th, outpacing this year’s two other rookies. “He has this insatiable desire to be better, to want more,” Vowles said. “He’s a perfectionist, and I like that in him.”
Commuting in a Compact Car
Britain, where Formula One originated in 1950, remains the sport’s spiritual home, where most of its 10 teams are based. Williams was founded in Oxfordshire in the 1970s, but it’s now an American subsidiary: Dorilton Capital, a private equity firm in New York City, bought the company in 2020 for an estimated $200 million.
It was an important cash infusion for a team that had struggled to keep up with rivals. Manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz pour enormous resources into their F1 teams, which double as an elaborate global marketing campaign and an in-house innovation farm; tech developed for F1, such as engines that recycle braking energy as an accelerant, can trickle into consumer vehicles.
The Williams campus is a humdrum brick pile that could be mistaken for an office park — a far cry from McLaren’s space-age complex an hour’s drive away. Many F1 teams provide their drivers with a high-end sports car for personal use; Sargeant commutes in a Vauxhall Astra, a compact.
Even the team’s sponsors are relatively down-market; whereas the official watch of Ferrari is Richard Mille (starting price: $60,000), Williams has a deal with Bremont, whose timepieces retail for significantly less. (On a recent visit, a Williams press aide was quick to extract a spare Bremont watch from his pocket and ensure that Sargeant was wearing it whenever a photographer hovered.)
Given the huge costs, corporate partnerships are crucial to F1, part of the reason the American market, with its abundance of affluent consumers and wealthy brands, has proved so tempting. Gerald Donaldson, a journalist who has covered F1 for 45 years, recalled how cars were gradually taken over by corporate logos starting in the late 1960s.
“Marlboro paid all the Ferrari bills, including the drivers, for many years,” he said in an interview. “There are eager companies who want the publicity.” Sargeant’s car features ads for Michelob Ultra beer and an American financial firm, Stephens. In Miami last weekend, beachgoers spotted an airborne banner reading “Go Logan!” alongside the image of a Duracell battery.
Last year, the Miami race was viewed on ABC by 2.6 million people, the biggest American audience for a live F1 telecast. Ratings for this year’s race fell about 25%, perhaps a result of a duller-than-usual season dominated by one team, Red Bull.
Still, viewing data shows that F1 is expanding beyond affluent cities associated with elite sports: In 2022, its top five American TV markets included Asheville, North Carolina, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. ESPN is clearly betting on more growth. When the sports network renewed its broadcast rights last year, it agreed to pay $90 million annually — up from the $5 million-a-year deal it signed in 2019.
Liam Parker, a former adviser to Boris Johnson who now leads communications at F1, said the sport was intent on rectifying past mistakes.
“We were too arrogant,” he said. “We couldn’t understand why the American fan base wasn’t falling in love with us.” But he pushed back on complaints that Liberty’s efforts to raise the entertainment factor had stripped F1 of something essential.
“This whole argument of ‘Americanization,’ it’s a very crude way to describe things,” he said. “We shouldn’t ignore things that can improve things for new and core fans. It’s about giving people more choices in the modern era. It’s modernization of access to everyone.”
Hamilton, arguably the biggest celebrity of the current F1 lineup, has offered his own endorsement of Liberty’s approach. “I mean, jeez, I grew up listening to LL Cool J,” he told reporters in Miami. “I thought it was cool, wasn’t an issue to me.”
For all the debates over elitism, good taste and corporate rap collaborations, the core appeal of F1, when you get right down to it, may be something simpler — something Sargeant got at when asked in the interview if he had loved cars as a kid.
“I absolutely love driving, as you can imagine,” he said. “But to be honest, I’m not one of those people who studies cars and, you know, likes to know every detail of every single car. It doesn’t really interest me.”
“The part that interests me,” he said, “is driving them as fast as I can go.”

Full text: A.I. screenwriting, a point of contention in the Writers Guild strike, may not yet be ready for prime time. But streaming algorithms and derivative programming have prepared the way for it.
Television loves a good sentient-machine story, from "Battlestar Galactica" to "Westworld" to "Mrs. Davis." With the Writers Guild of America strike, that premise has broken the fourth wall. The robots are here, and the humans are racing to defend against them, or to ally with them.
Among the many issues in the strike is the union's aim to "regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies," at a time when the ability of chatbots to auto-generate all manner of writing is growing exponentially.
In essence, writers are asking the studios for guardrails against being replaced by A.I., having their work used to train A.I. or being hired to punch up A.I.-generated scripts at a fraction of their former pay rates.
The big-ticket items in the strike involve, broadly, how the streaming model has disrupted the ways TV writers have made a living. But it's the A.I. question that has captured imaginations, understandably so. Hollywood loves robot stories because they make us confront what distinguishes us as human. And when it comes to distinguishing features, the ability to conjure imaginary worlds is simply sexier than the opposable thumb.
So the prospect of A.I. screenwriting has become potent, both as threat and rallying cry. Detractors of the striking writers taunted them on social media that software was going to horse-and-buggy their livelihoods. Striking WGA members workshopped A.I. jokes on their picket signs, like "ChatGPT doesn't have childhood trauma." (Well, it doesn't have its own. It has Sylvia Plath's, and that of any other former unhappy child whose writing survives in machine-readable form.)
But it shouldn't surprise anyone if the TV business wants to leave open the option of relying on machine-generated entertainment. In a way, it already does.
Not in the way the WGA fears -- not yet. Even the most by-the-numbers scripted drama you watch today was not written by a computer program. But it might have been recommended to you by one.
Algorithms, the force behind your streaming-TV "For You" menu, are in the business of noticing what you like and matching you with acceptable-enough versions of it. To many, this is indeed acceptable enough: More than 80 percent of viewing on Netflix is driven by the recommendation engine.
In order to make those matches, the algorithm needs a lot of content. Not necessarily brilliant, unique, nothing-like-it content, but familiar, reliable, plenty-of-things-like-it content. Which, as it happens, is what A.I. is best at.
The debate over A.I. in screenwriting is often simplified as, "Could a chatbot write the next 'Twin Peaks'?" No, at least for now. Nor would anyone necessarily want it to. The bulk of TV production has no interest in generating the next "Twin Peaks" -- that is, a wild, confounding creative risk. It is interested in more reboots, more procedurals, more things similar to what you just watched.
TV has always relied on formula, not necessarily in a bad way. It iterates, it churns out slight variations on a theme, it provides comfort. That's what has long made strictly formatted shows like "Law & Order" such reliable, relaxing prime-time companions. That's also what could make them among the first candidates for A.I. screenwriting.
Large language models like ChatGPT work by digesting vast quantities of existing text, identifying patterns and responding to prompts by mimicking what they've learned. The more done-to-death a TV idea is, the greater the corpus of text available on it.
And, well, there are a lot of "Law & Order" scripts, a lot of superhero plots, a lot of dystopian thrillers. How many writers-contract cycles before you can simply drop the "Harry Potter" novels into the Scriptonator 3000 and let it spit out a multiseason series?
In the perceptive words of "Mrs. Davis," the wildly human comedic thriller about an all-powerful A.I., "Algorithms love clichés." And there's a direct line between the unoriginality of the business -- things TV critics complain about, like reboots and intellectual-property adaptations and plain old derivative stories -- and the ease with which entertainment could become bloated by machine-generated mediocrity.
After all, if studios treat writers like machines, asking for more remakes and clones -- and if viewers are satisfied with that -- it's easy to imagine the bean counters wanting to skip the middle-human and simply use a program that never dreamed of becoming the next Phoebe Waller-Bridge.
And one could reasonably ask, why not? Why not leave the formulas to machines and rely on people only for more innovative work? Beyond the human cost of unemployment, though, there's an entire ecosystem in which writers come up, often through precisely those workmanlike shows, to learn the ropes.
Those same writers may be able to use A.I. tools productively; the WGA is calling for guardrails, not a ban. And the immediate threat of A.I. to writers' careers may be overstated, as you know if you've ever tried to get ChatGPT to tell you a joke. (It's a big fan of cornball "Why did the ..." and "What do you call a ..." constructions.) Some speculations, like the director Joe Russo's musing that A.I. some day might be able to whip up a rom-com starring your avatar and Marilyn Monroe's, feel like science fiction.
But science fiction has a way of becoming science fact. A year ago, ChatGPT wasn't even available to the public. The last time the writers went on strike, in 2007, one of the sticking points involved streaming media, then a niche business involving things like iTunes downloads. Today, streaming has swallowed the industry.
The potential rise of A.I. has workplace implications for writers, but it's not only a labor issue. We, too, have a stake in the war with the storybots. A culture that is fed entirely by regurgitating existing ideas is a stagnant one. We need invention, experimentation and, yes, failure, in order to advance and evolve. The logical conclusion of an algorithmicized, "more like what you just watched" entertainment industry is a popular culture that just ... stops.
Maybe someday A.I. will be capable of genuine invention. It's also possible that what "invention" means for advanced A.I. will be different from anything we're used to -- it might be wondrous or weird or incomprehensible. At that point, there's a whole discussion we can have about what "creativity" actually means and whether it is by definition limited to humans.
But what we do know is that, in this timeline, it is a human skill to create a story that surprises, challenges, frustrates, discovers ideas that did not exist before. Whether we care about that -- whether we value it over an unlimited supply of reliable, good-enough menu options -- is, for now, still our choice.

Full text: In an interview, John Koblin, who covers the television industry for The New York Times, discussed the ongoing writers' strike.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Prepare to wait awhile longer for the return of "Stranger Things," "Abbott Elementary" and a number of other beloved TV shows.
Last week, the Writers Guild of America, which represents about 11,500 writers of television and film, went on strike after contract negotiations with studios and streaming services failed. It is the W.G.A.'s first strike in 15 years; the last strike, which began in 2007, lasted 100 days.
The impasse has brought many television productions to a standstill. Last week, picket lines formed in Los Angeles and New York; late-night talk shows went dark and their slots have since been filled with reruns. With no solution in sight, the fate of popular shows -- and perhaps, the fall TV season -- hangs in the balance.
In an interview, John Koblin, a media reporter who covers the TV industry for The New York Times, discussed how the rise of streaming services factored into the strike and where negotiations might go from here. This conversation has been edited.
Can you tell me about the strike and what's at stake for the W.G.A.?
The writers went on strike early last week. They say this moment is existential and that the survival of the writing profession is at stake. The reason they're using this really urgent language is because they say that their working conditions have deteriorated significantly in the streaming era.
Despite the fact that there has been an explosion in television production, their pay has stagnated. W.G.A. leaders say this affects every writer, from the well-decorated showrunner to the junior writer just getting a foot in the door.
What is the W.G.A. asking for?
In a very 2023 twist, one of the issues is putting significant guardrails around the use of artificial intelligence. The writers are looking for this in two ways. One is that ChatGPT, for example, cannot write or be credited on a script. Another is to put guardrails against source material. An example that one screenwriter, John August, gave me was that a studio executive cannot have ChatGPT generate a 15-page document about pandas and then take that document to you and say, "Write a movie about pandas."
But really, the core of this strike is about compensation. There are two things they're asking for. One is a miniroom, also known as a developing room. There's no one definition for a miniroom, but they have proliferated over the last decade. In one example, studios will convene a miniroom before a show has been ordered to series. The writers claim that because it's not a formal writers' room, they will use that as justification to pay writers less, even though they're writing scripts and developing a show.
The other issue is the fact that 20 years ago, episode orders could be for 22, 24, 26 episodes. But in the streaming era, episode orders are much shorter -- six, seven, eight episodes. As a result, writers say that they leave a miniroom or a writer's room sooner than they would have in the past; they are left scrambling to find another job.
How does this moment compare to the writer's strike that began in 2007?
You'll hear the writers say, as united as they were then, they are even more united now. In 2007, they didn't have a lot of other support from their union brethren. It's very different this time around. Other unions, including the Hollywood union, voiced support for the writers. Another thing you'll hear the writers say is that as significant as their ambitions were in 2007, it's even more urgent now.
W.G.A. renegotiates contracts with studios every three years. Why is this happening now?
We could have potentially seen some labor issues in 2020, but the pandemic happened just as negotiations began. One of the chairs of the W.G.A.'s negotiating committee said, We only walk when we feel like we are facing an existential crisis and like something significant has happened. That is why you have these generational strikes; they usually accompany technological shifts. In 2007, that was the advent of the internet.
Would you say this strike is the result of the rise of streaming services?
Yes. A decade ago, Netflix introduced "House of Cards." That was one of its first original shows. In the last four years, we've seen the rise of streaming services, such as Apple TV+ and HBO Max, and the decline of cable television. You'd be hard-pressed to find a lot of people who watch cable or network TV in the way that they did a few years ago.
Where do you predict the strike goes from here?
The talks broke down a week ago; there have been no negotiations all week. After the strike was called, one of the lead W.G.A. negotiators told me in an interview, "Philosophically and practically, we're very far apart," which is something that has been underscored and reiterated by company executives in recent days as well, including by Bob Bakish, the chief executive of Paramount.
It's such a significant gap right now, and the writers are very fired up and united. It's really hard to predict, but there is a feeling within Hollywood that this could be a long strike.

If Dark Energy Brings About the End, What Then?: [Science Desk]

Full text: The End is coming, in maybe 100 billion years. Is it too soon to start freaking out?
"There will be a last sentient being, there will be a last thought," declared Janna Levin, a cosmologist at Barnard College, near the end of "A Trip to Infinity," a new Netflix documentary directed by Jonathan Halperin and Drew Takahashi.
When I heard that statement during a showing of the film recently, it broke my heart. It was the saddest, loneliest idea I had ever contemplated. I thought I was aware and knowledgeable about our shared cosmic predicament -- namely, that if what we think we know about physics and cosmology is true, life and intelligence are doomed. I thought I had made some kind of intellectual peace with that.
But this was an angle that I hadn't thought of before. At some point in the future there will be somewhere in the universe where there will be a last sentient being. And a last thought. And that last word, no matter how profound or mundane, will vanish into silence along with the memory of Einstein and Elvis, Jesus, Buddha, Aretha and Eve, while the remaining bits of the physical universe go on sailing apart for billions upon billions upon billions of lonely, silent years.
Will that last thought be a profound pearl of wisdom? An expletive?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
How did we humans get into this fix? The universe as we know it originated in a fiery burst 13.8 billion years ago and has been flying apart ever since. Astronomers argued for decades about whether it would go on expanding forever or someday collapse again into a "big crunch."
All that changed in 1998 when astronomers discovered that the cosmic expansion was speeding up, boosted by an anti-gravitational force that is part of the fabric of spacetime. The bigger the universe gets, the harder this "dark energy" pushes it apart. This new force bears a striking resemblance to the cosmological constant, a cosmic repulsion Einstein had proposed as a fudge factor in his equations as a way of explaining why the universe did not collapse, but later rejected as a blunder.
But the cosmological constant refused to die. And now it threatens to wreck physics and the universe.
In the end, if this dark energy prevails, distant galaxies will eventually be speeding away so fast that we can't see them anymore. The more time goes on, the less we will know about the universe. The stars will die and not be reborn. It will be like living inside an inside-out black hole, sucking matter, energy and information over the horizon, never to return.
Worse, because thinking takes energy, eventually there will not be enough energy in the universe to hold a thought. In the end there will only be subatomic particles dancing intergalactic distances away from each other in a dark silence, trillions upon trillions of years after there was any light or life in the universe. And then, more uncountable trillions of eons to come, until there is finally no way to count the years, as Brian Greene, the popular Columbia University theorist and author, so elegantly and devastatingly described it in his recent book, "Until the End of Time."
It's hard not to want to scream at our own insignificance in all of this. If this is, in fact, what the universe will come to. The universe as we know it is now 14 billion years old, which seems like a long time but is only an infinitesimal sliver of the trillions and quadrillions of years of darkness to come. It will mean that everything interesting in our universe happened in a brief flash, at the very beginning. A promising start, and then an eternal abyss. The finality and futility of it all!
In short, a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. What do we do with a universe like this?
You may point out that it is way too soon to be prescribing a future for the universe. New discoveries in physics could provide an escape hatch. Maybe dark energy will not be constant; maybe it will turn around and recompress the universe. In an email, Michael Turner, the cosmologist emeritus formerly at the University of Chicago who coined the term dark energy, referring to the Greek letter symbolizing Einstein's cosmological constant said, "Lambda would be the most uninteresting answer to the dark energy puzzle!"
But for now, that is what we have to look forward to.
Our goose will be cooked a billion or so years from now, when the Sun boils away the oceans. A few billion years later the Sun itself will die, burning Earth and anything that remains of us to a crisp.
There is no escaping to space. The galaxies themselves will collapse into black holes in about 10^30 years.
And black holes will finally release all that they have imprisoned as a thin spray of particles and radiation, to be scattered into the prevailing wind of dark energy whisking them apart.
In some variations on the story, known as the Big Rip, dark energy could eventually grow strong enough to tear apart the tombstones that mark your grave.
And so, just as there was a first living creature somewhere, sometime, to emerge from the splendid blaze of the Big Bang, there will be a last creature to die, a last thought. A last sentient being, as Dr. Levin pointed out.
That idea is what stopped me short. It had never occurred to me that some individual being would have the last word on existence, the last chance to curse or be grateful. Part of the pain is that nobody will know who, or what, had the last word, or what was thought or said. Somehow that notion made cosmic extinction more personal, and I wondered what it would be like.
Maybe as all the energy dwindles away over the horizon it will be like falling asleep. Or like Einstein mumbling his last words in German to a nurse who didn't know the language. Or the computer at the end of time in Isaac Asimov's classic story "The Last Question," finally figuring out the secret of the universe and declaring, "Let there be light." Might it be some blazing realization about the nature of string theory or the final secret about black holes? I hate to miss out on it.
I'd like to think my last thought would be one of love or gratitude or awe or about the face of a loved one, but I worry it would be an expletive.
Wiser people than me ask, when I go on about this, why I don't whine about the billions of years that passed before I was born? Perhaps it's because I didn't know what I was missing, whereas now I've had a lifetime to imagine what I'll miss.
If that worries you, here is an encouraging metaphor straight from Einstein's equations: When you are inside a black hole, light pours in from the outside universe, which seems to speed up while you appear to be frozen. In principle, you could see the whole future history of the galaxy or even the whole universe speed past you as you fall toward the center, the singularity where space and time stop, and you die.
Maybe death could be like that, a revelation of all of the past and future.
In a sense, when we die the future dies too.
Rather than whine about the end of time, most of the physicists and astronomers I talk to say the notion is a relief. The death of the future frees them to concentrate on the magic of the moment.
The late, great astrophysicist, philosopher and black hole evangelist John Archibald Wheeler, of Princeton, used to say that the past and the future are fiction, that they only exist in the artifacts and the imaginations of the present.
According to that point of view, the universe ends with me, and so in a sense I do have the final word.
"Nothing lasts forever" is a maxim that applies to the stock market and the stars as well as to our lives and Buddhist sand paintings. A whiff of eternity can illuminate an entire lifetime, perhaps even mine.
No matter what happens in the endless eons to come, at least we were here for the party, for the brief shining sliver of eternity when the universe teemed with life and light.
We'll always have the Milky Way.

Full text: The actor has analog tastes, like listening to records and walking in the park. He will sneak in a little "Flight Simulator," though.
In the 1990s, Ato Essandoh was planning to become a professor when a girlfriend at Cornell University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, dared him to audition for a play.
He never looked back, landing parts in movies from "Garden State" to "Django Unchained" and TV shows including "Blue Bloods" and "Girls." Now the 50-year-old actor is currently starring opposite Keri Russell in the new Netflix series "The Diplomat."
Mr. Essandoh lives alone in a two-bedroom apartment in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. He is not looking for roommates. "Living with other people is not a problem, but I like being the captain of my own space," he said. "I like walking around in my underwear."
GO-TO I drag myself out of bed weirdly early. I don't want to be around anybody right away, but I'll sort of emerge from my lair, and the first place I go is Peck's, across the street. I'm going to say this right now: Peck's is the best pastry shop and coffee shop on the planet. Their breakfast sandwich game is ridiculous. It's one of the reasons I live in Clinton Hill and won't leave. Nobody I've ever brought there is like, "This is not amazing." Actually, Keri Russell has gone to Peck's. Once I was wearing a Peck's shirt and she's like, "The breakfast sandwiches, right?"
ROOTED Depending on the weather, I'll either sit there and joke around with the owner and manager or I'll take a walk. One of my favorite places to walk is Fort Greene Park. And I just happen to be standing in it right now. I love a good park, and this is a scrappy little park. I was just shooting in London and their parks are amazing because it's the queen's land -- or I guess now the king's -- but in this small, contained park, I know all the trees and I try to remember all the names of them. I also love to go running around the trail here. This place is another reason I stay in Clinton Hill.
OLD SCHOOL Maybe I'll stroll back home and sit in my chair and listen to records. I have a huge record collection. As much as a technophile as I am, I love to listen to actual records. The nice thing about a record is it's not going to try to Tweet you. You don't have to have Wi-Fi or remember a password to listen. No ads pop up. Jazz, blues, hip-hop and classic rock are sort of the bedrock of my musical taste, but it spans all the genres. My Miles Davis and Coltrane records are my favorites. But I love good pop music. Prince is my favorite artist of all time.
THE GEAR A while ago I got a bunch of money. I don't have children, so I spent a college fund's worth of money on a stereo I had to have shipped. I can sit there and listen for hours. Sometimes I'll strum my guitar while I'm listening.
SOUNDS GOOD If I feel like I've been sitting a while, maybe I'll get up and go record shopping. There's a new place I've only checked out one or two times called Head Sounds Records that's like a 15-minute walk away in Fort Greene. You know when you're walking into a record store and the owner's an aficionado and you're instantly like, I don't want to say something stupid? There, you don't feel like you need a pass code to get a great recommendation. I love getting a record I've never heard of.
MR. AMBASSADOR I like to eat an early dinner-brunchy kind of situation. Graziella's is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. I know the owner; he's such a sweet guy. There's also the relatively new Osteria Brooklyn, next to my place, that's owned by another cool Italian dude. I like to go with friends so I can introduce them to the neighborhood. My Manhattan friends usually become Brooklyn converts. I feel like I'm kind of the ambassador to Clinton Hill.
HEADS UP I used to have a policy where on Sunday I don't touch media or look at my phone. But that's gone by the wayside because in our business, it could be your agent calling, saying you need to be on a plane on Monday. You're reminding me I want to bring back the no-media policy. Because the things you miss when you're staring at those two inches of screen can be ridiculous. I've seen eagles in the park because I'm looking up, not looking at my phone. I'm one of those people who, when I'm walking, I'll look in brownstone windows and be like, Ooh! Look at that chandelier. That's me. Again, when you're not looking at your phone, you can see things.
'I'VE GOT THIS' Later I'll probably listen to more records or maybe play a video game or two. I have an Xbox, which has "Flight Simulator" on it. I also have the yoke an actual pilot would use. What fascinates me about that game is, I am legit convinced that if you are on a plane and the flight's going down and the pilot is incapacitated, if there's somebody who's been playing "Flight Simulator" for like 5,000 hours, that person is your best bet to land the plane safely. It's like a public service. Like, guys, don't worry. I'll fly you guys down. I've got this.
BEDTIME Then I turn into a monk. I could be going to bed at 9 or 10 p.m. I love my sleep. That's what gets me up in the morning. As a 50-year-old man, I've learned that. You know what? Clubs were cool when you were 30. Now you're a bad person if you don't have at least seven hours of sleep.

Full text: The joke-cracking Scottish musician's melodramatic ballad "Someone You Loved" is a blockbuster. Figuring out his next moves became more complicated than he'd anticipated.
The first thing you have to know about Lewis Capaldi is that he is kidding. The Scottish musician, who specializes in pop treacle, is foulmouthed the way a young child is -- cheekily and cuddly, without a fleck of harm. He is anti-piety, a bloke on a punchline bender. Almost everything he says is accompanied by a wink.
One Wednesday afternoon last month, Capaldi jumped out of a chauffeured SUV in Times Square, joined by his manager and a handful of associates. Up on a billboard -- which one wasn't immediately clear -- was an ad for a documentary Capaldi had released on Netflix that day, and he was there to film some shocked-and-awed promotional content for social media.
The first time the ad rotated in, Capaldi tried a couple of photos pointing up at himself -- eh, not so funny. By the third time, after several interruptions from fans surprised to see the global superstar out and about, he'd figured out a mischievous plan.
He hit record. "People over here are having orgasms left, right and center," he shouted into his phone's camera, while clips from the film played behind him. He gave the phone a serious, shocked look, then added, "Whenever they see my face."
He seemed pleased. The next day, he posted the video to his Instagram story, quickly followed by footage of someone wheat-pasting posters over his own ads. "My 15 minutes of fame are over," he deadpanned.
Those minutes, though -- they have been very, very intense. In late 2018, Capaldi released "Someone You Loved," a startlingly crisp and uncommonly beautiful jolt of nuclear-grade mush. It is lightly schlocky in the 1980s way -- ultra-saccharine, hyper-melodramatic -- a diminishing resource in the contemporary pop landscape. It has become the fourth most streamed song in Spotify history, with 2.76 billion streams.

Just before his Times Square outing, Capaldi, 26, was nursing a Sprite at an outdoor table at the classic New York City dive bar the Ear Inn, musing over the weight of such a massive hit.
"Such an anomaly," he said. "I hate saying this because it makes me feel noxious almost. It's becoming quite an evergreen song. I still hear it as much as I did when I first put it out." For those who feel that they have been oppressed by the song, he understands: "You get to a point where people might just be like, We don't want to hear you whine again about something. Can you do something that's a bit less?"
He was wearing a ruddy brown vintage Carhartt jacket, a black Nike sweatshirt, dark pants and Vans -- simple and unglamorous. Around a dozen times over two hours on a block with almost no foot traffic, he was politely interrupted by fans -- at one point, a car screeched over to the curb so the driver could hop out to tell Capaldi he'd seen him perform in Philadelphia the previous night. ("He jumped out his car, just like I told him to," Capaldi joked.)
"It's fine if that's my song forever, and I kind of expect that to be" -- at this moment, he was interrupted by a young girl, maybe 6 or 7 years old, and her mother, asking for an autograph.
"What name should I put on it?" he asked. "Just your name," the girl replied, and Capaldi guffawed.
Capaldi's nominally less scarred second album, "Broken by Desire to Be Heavenly Sent," will be released this month. Not every track on the album is a laser-targeted assault on the emotional stability of the listener, but the best ones are. Whether he'll be able to unmoor his adoring public to the same degree he did the last go-round remains to be seen.
Either way, Capaldi remains sanguine. "I went into releasing 'Someone You Loved' going, 'This probably isn't going to do that well.' I'm going into this going, 'This probably isn't going to do as well as "Someone You Loved"' -- that's a very big jump," he said.
Capaldi has a scorched cannon of a voice, and it's best deployed on songs about anguish. To date, his career has lurched forward one vocal bloodletting at a time. His debut single, "Bruises," in 2017, was viral for that era. His debut album, "Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent," was released in 2019 and featured "Someone You Loved" -- which topped the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for a song of the year Grammy -- and also "Before You Go," another howling and deeply moving catalog of despair.
While all of this was happening, on the internet and in the media, he was a relentless jester -- hilariously self-deprecating on Instagram and, later, TikTok. ("In the U.K. it's like, This [expletive] guy again," Capaldi said of his musical success there, whereas in the United States, "There are people here who just know the TikTok.")
Capaldi has had umpteen small moments in which his comedic persona has been as loud as his songs. At the Grammys in 2020, he had an Andy Kaufmanesque face-off on the red carpet with an unsuspecting Ryan Seacrest.
"I was throwing a baseball at a brick wall, so there was no recoil," Capaldi said of the appealingly peculiar interaction, adding that he'd been enjoying the fruits of Grammy weekend partying. "It was like, oh, this is so bizarre. But then in my head I'm like, this is even funnier."
All the while, his health was precarious. Last year, he announced that he'd been given a diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome -- for Capaldi, it manifests in physical tics that arrive at random and can be made worse by stress. Sometimes, they happen when he's onstage -- at one recent concert, the crowd finished the songs that he couldn't. But the tics subside when he's at ease: When fans came up to him outside the Ear Inn to chat, they all but disappeared.
"This sounds gross, but it's become part of like a marketing strategy," he said. "Every piece of content or thing I see with my name next to it is closely followed by Tourette's. Which is mental, 'cause then I'm like, Billie Eilish has Tourette's, and she doesn't bang on about it like I do."
He continued, "It feels dirty. It feels odd." Then he added with a laugh, "Whatever sells the records!"
Capaldi's diagnosis and the management of his illness is a major theme of his new documentary, "Lewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling Now," which was originally intended to capture him wrestling with how to navigate a musical answer to one of the biggest songs in recent years, but ended up also documenting a much darker and more worrisome stretch of events.
The cameras hover over Capaldi at his most awkward -- false starts in the songwriting room ("My insecurity was so sky high"), cold sores on his lips, his manager fretting about whether any of the songs he has recorded are a worthy follow-up to "Someone You Loved," his parents critiquing his songs. And also the tics that have been a feature of his life since childhood, which he now understands are attributable to his Tourette's. He talks about going on the medication sertraline, which gives him diarrhea and erectile dysfunction.
The film ends on a lightly triumphant comeback note, but the original ending was more somber. Capaldi said watching it was disorienting: "I was like, 'Do I die? Is this posthumous?"'
The day after Capaldi's Times Square adventure, he was performing at Radio City Music Hall. Backstage a few hours before the show, in between playing putt-putt and eating Flamin' Hot Cheetos, he remarked that he was planning to take omeprazole pills before his upcoming appearance on the spicy wings challenge talk show "Hot Ones," a booking that fulfilled what he called in a 2018 tweet "ma life long dream."
In this country, he is both very, very popular and, somehow, a bit of a cipher. Onstage at Radio City, he joked about how much smaller the room was than the shows he'd recently played in Europe. "Every minute I'm up here I'm losing money," he said. "It's really not worth it." (The show was still his biggest American concert to date, a quirk of blowing up just before the pandemic.)
Near the end of the set he played "Wish You the Best," a song that is the logical inheritor of "Someone You Loved" -- cataclysmically depressing, but somehow triumphant and engineered for universal acclamation. The video is primally gut-wrenching, if you'll allow for it; on TikTok, Capaldi has been cheerfully reposting fans' clips of themselves weeping uncontrollably at its ending.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But he chose not to release it as the first single from the new album, because he wanted a bit of freedom from the success he'd earned for himself. "I mean, I would love to work with, like, the Thom Yorkes of this world, but unfortunately, I don't think he'd answer the call," Capaldi said. Lately he's been listening to the Mount Eerie album "A Crow Looked at Me," an anti-pop grief purge that arrives at the same affect as Capaldi's music with absolutely none of the bombast.
"There are ballads on the album for sure, and I think maybe the easy thing to do would've been to put them out first," he said. "It's not necessarily that I was trying not to be put in a box. I just felt it weird to come back straight in: Here's a ballad. Again."
In the documentary, you see Capaldi and his manager grappling with the follow-up pressure. In the SUV heading to Times Square, Capaldi needled his manager for having a "major label mind-set."
He understands, though. "There's so much on the line," Capaldi explained. "I totally get why people are nervous and jumpy."
Capaldi closes the album with "How I'm Feeling Now," an acoustic confession of his insecurities. "It's like 'The Elephant Man' -- 'I am a human being!"' he said, emphasizing that he's more than just a ballad automaton. "I wanted to suck the air out a little bit."
At Radio City, though, there was little sign that Capaldi was unhappy with his lot. "New York!" he shouted. "It feels so good to be inside of you!" At the merch stand, he was selling country-and-western-style T-shirts that read "America's Sweetheart Returns: Stealing Hearts in Every State." The Jonas Brothers joined him onstage for a song, and Capaldi shouted to the crowd about how ... aroused he was.
Before "Before You Go," about the death of his aunt by suicide, he solemnly proclaimed, "I want to thank you, Pat, 'cause it made me a lot of money." And during "Lost on You," he playfully chided the crowd for singing along too enthusiastically -- "The song's not finished, shut the [expletive] up."
He paused, then gave the crowd a rascally grin: "It sounds much better when I sing it." Everyone cheered.

Rock Hall of Fame Reveals The Inductees for 2023: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rounding out the far-from-traditional class of 2023: George Michael, Sheryl Crow, Rage Against the Machine and the Spinners.
The reclusive (but freshly relevant) experimental pop singer Kate Bush, the one-of-one rapper Missy Elliott and the 90-year-old country stalwart Willie Nelson are among this year's genre-spanning inductees to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The organization behind the museum and annual ceremony announced the lineup on Wednesday, underlining how the new class reflected "the diverse artists and sounds that define rock & roll."
Rounding out the seven acts voted in by more than 1,000 artists, historians and music industry professionals are the pop singer George Michael, who died in 2016; the 1970s soul group the Spinners, who had been nominated three times prior; the platinum-selling 1990s pop-rock singer Sheryl Crow; and the politically rambunctious rap-rock band Rage Against the Machine, who crossed the threshold after its fifth time on the ballot.
The Rock Hall ceremony will be held on Friday, Nov. 3, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.
Furthering a pattern that has taken shape in recent years -- following steady criticism against the Rock Hall for its lack of inclusion, especially among race and gender lines -- none of the musicians inducted this time fit neatly into the most narrow strictures of what constitutes rock. But as the genre and the institution continue to evolve, those behind the scenes have proved increasingly welcome to honoring rappers, pop singers and country artists like Dolly Parton, who attempted to remove herself from consideration last year but was voted in anyway.
In a statement accompanying the induction announcement on Wednesday, John Sykes, the chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, said, "We are honored that this November's induction ceremony in New York will coincide with two milestones in music culture; the 90th birthday of Willie Nelson and the 50th anniversary of the birth of hip-hop."
Nelson -- who celebrated his birthday over the weekend with a concert featuring Neil Young, Miranda Lambert and Snoop Dogg -- had been eligible for the Rock Hall since 1987, 25 years after the release of his first commercial recording and six years before he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Like Michael, best known for hits like "Faith" and "Freedom! '90," this was Nelson's first time on the ballot.
Bush, who has not released an album in more than a decade, had been nominated three times prior. But she may have received a boost thanks to renewed interest in her music since last year, when a placement in the Netflix show "Stranger Things" sent her 1985 single "Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)" back onto pop radio and to a new peak of No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100.
Elliott will become the first woman in rap to be included in the Rock Hall, following previous recognition for artists like Run-DMC, Beastie Boys, N.W.A, Public Enemy and Jay-Z. "I want to say this is HUGE not for just me but all my Sisters in HIPHOP," she wrote in a string of tweets on Wednesday. "this door is now OPEN to showcase the hard work & what many of us contribute to MUSIC. I have cried all morning because I am GRATEFUL."
Voters passed over more traditional rock bands on the latest ballot like Soundgarden, the White Stripes, Iron Maiden and Joy Division, as well as the singer-songwriters Warren Zevon and Cyndi Lauper. The rap group A Tribe Called Quest also failed to make the cut.
Yet outside of those inducted as performers, the ceremony this fall will also celebrate the hip-hop pioneer DJ Kool Herc and the guitarist Link Wray (awarded for "musical influence"); the singer Chaka Khan, the composer and producer Al Kooper and the songwriter Bernie Taupin (for "musical excellence"); and the "Soul Train" creator, producer and host Don Cornelius (posthumously receiving the Ahmet Ertegun award for executives).

Hollywood Writers Go on Strike, And Late-Night Shows Go Dark: [National Desk]

Full text: How long they stay off the air is an open question. During the last strike, they gradually returned after a couple of months.
Just hours after the union representing thousands of television and movie writers announced that they were going on strike, hundreds of their members occupied an entire city block in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday.
Gathered outside an NBCUniversal event on Fifth Avenue, the writers chanted "No contract, no content" and held up signs with slogans like "Pencils Down!!!" and "Spoiler Alert: We Will Win."
"These companies are absolutely destroying our industry," Tony Kushner, the acclaimed playwright and a screenwriter of movies like "Lincoln" and "The Fabelmans," said from the picket line, referring to Hollywood studios.
It was a noisy show of solidarity, echoed on picket lines outside the major studios in Los Angeles. But the immediate fallout of the strike -- which shattered 15 years of labor peace in the entertainment industry and will bring much of Hollywood's production assembly line to a halt -- was felt most acutely in the world of late-night television, which immediately went dark.
On Tuesday afternoon, NBC issued a statement that the upcoming edition of the "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" would be a repeat from April. "Late Night With Seth Meyers" canceled a show that was supposed to feature an interview with the actress Rachel Weisz, replacing it with a rerun from February.
New episodes from late-night shows hosted by Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel have also been suspended. "Saturday Night Live" canceled a new episode scheduled for this weekend with Pete Davidson as host. NBC said it would "air repeats until further notice," raising the possibility that the show will not be able to end its 48th season with a finale.
How long late-night talk shows stay off the air is an open question. During the last strike, in 2007, late-night shows gradually came back after about two months, even with their writers still on picket lines. (That strike lasted 100 days.)
Mr. Kimmel, ABC's late-night host, was paying his staff out of pocket during that strike, and he said years later that he had to return to air because he had nearly drained his life savings.
David Letterman, who owned his CBS late-night show through his production company Worldwide Pants, made a deal with the Writers Guild of America that allowed his writers to come back on the show.
The other hosts -- whose shows were owned by media companies -- had no such luck. Hosts like Mr. Kimmel and Conan O'Brien returned without their writers, and gamely tried to put together their shows without their standard monologues. Mr. O'Brien had to resort to time-killing gimmicks, such as spinning his wedding ring on his desk, setting a timer to it in the process.
Jay Leno, the host of "The Tonight Show," infuriated W.G.A. officials by writing his own monologue jokes. "A Jew, a Christian and a Muslim walk into a bar," Mr. Leno said during his opening monologue, which stretched nearly 10 minutes. "The Jew says to the Muslim, see, I have no idea what they say, because there's a writers' strike."
Late-night hosts and their top producers have been on group calls in recent weeks, coordinating a response in the event of a strike, according to a person briefed on the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Unlike the enmity of the so-called late-night wars from the 1990s, the hosts have made a concerted effort to show that they are on friendly, if still competitive, terms. When James Corden signed off from "The Late Late Show" last week, there was a taped segment that featured Mr. Colbert, Mr. Fallon, Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Meyers all together.
Mr. Meyers, the host of NBC's 12:30 a.m. show, alluded to the devastation of the last strike in a segment late last week.
"It doesn't just affect the writers," Mr. Meyers said in the web-only video. "It affects all the incredible nonwriting staff on these shows."
He added that he was a proud member of the W.G.A., and that he felt strongly that what the writers were asking for was "not unreasonable."
"If you don't see me here next week, know that it is something that is not done lightly, and that I will be heartbroken to miss you as well," he said.
The strike would have to stretch for a significantly longer time before viewers began to see the effects on scripted TV shows and movies, because the production process for them can take months or more than a year. But the mere fact that many productions suddenly stopped was a blow to an industry already rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.
The biggest issue for the writers is pay. They have said that their compensation has stagnated even as television production has rapidly grown over the past decade. The unions representing the writers, the East and West branches of the Writers Guild of America, said "the companies' behavior has created a gig economy inside a union work force, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing."
W.G.A. leaders have called this moment "existential," arguing that the "the survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation."
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said in a statement shortly before the strike was announced that its offer included "generous increases in compensation for writers."
The primary sticking points, according to the studios, involve union proposals that would require companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time "whether needed or not."
Chris Keyser, a chair of the W.G.A. negotiating committee, said in an interview early Tuesday morning that "philosophically, and practically, we're very far apart."
Over the last decade, a period that is often referred to as Peak TV, the number of scripted television shows broadcast in the United States has risen sharply. Writers, however, said that their pay has stagnated.
In the network television era, a writer could get work on a show with more than 20 episodes a season, providing a steady living for an entire year. However, in the streaming era, episode orders have declined to 8 or 12, and the median weekly pay for a writer-producer has gone down slightly, the W.G.A. said.
"They're making it impossible for younger writers to make a living," Mr. Kushner, the playwright and screenwriter, said. "Our wages have declined since the last strike."
The writers want to also fix the formula for residual payments, which have been upended by streaming. Years ago, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed -- into syndication or through DVD sales. But global streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have cut off those distribution arms and pay a fixed residual instead.
For now, the writers' creative energy will be solely dedicated to their picket signs. Outside the NBCUniversal event, one writer held up a sign that read, "Pay your writers or we'll spoil 'Succession."'

Where Martial Arts and Jane Austen Meet: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Vincentelli, Elisabeth

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The writer-director set out to make "a joyful film about South Asian Muslim women" that didn't revolve around trauma. The result is "Polite Society."
"Polite Society" is an action caper filled with martial arts battles and secret lairs. It's a romance in which two smart, impossibly attractive people fall in love. It's a Jane Austen-esque comedy of marriage in which a teenager meddles in her older sister's love life while their parents look on in dismay.
It's also a movie with a lavish, Bollywood-inspired musical number, because why settle on a single genre when you can cram in as many as possible?
Yet this new British film does not feel tonally inconsistent or stylistically scattered; rather, form imaginatively fits function.
"It's about women dealing with norms and expectations and rules, and wanting to push them," the writer-director Nida Manzoor explained in a video conversation from Bristol, England. "When they're breaking them, I've got to break genres as well. So it all felt like it was working together, not just me being insane." She laughed. "Maybe a bit of me being insane."
Reviewing "Polite Society" for The New York Times, Amy Nicholson called it a delight that signals the arrival of Manzoor as "a promising new thing: a first-time filmmaker impatient to evolve cultural representation from the last few years of self-conscious vitamins into crowd-pleasing candy."
In the film, Ria, the youngest in a British Pakistani family, attends high school while training hard to fulfill her dream of becoming a stuntwoman. (She idolizes Eunice Huthart, a real-life Liverpudlian with extensive experience as a Hollywood stunt double.) And so the actress portraying her, Priya Kansara, had to get with the program -- fast.
"I have no prior martial arts experience or anything like that," Kansara said in a video chat. "I was cast around six, seven weeks before we started the shoot, so that's the time I had to learn as many of the stunts and the fight choreography. It was intense because there was so much to get through. And Ria is just a crazy kid; she doesn't really stop."
The plot moves at a fast clip peppered with a lot of action, which is nearly always layered with rambunctious comedy. When Ria, who usually has no time for "girlie" accouterments, is forced to endure a wax, the scene is shot like a dramatic interrogation in an early James Bond movie -- "but with this kind of villain Auntie character," Manzoor said, referring to Ria's nemesis, played by Nimra Bucha.
The film is often cathartic in the way it lets girls and women do -- with contagious glee -- things we have seen men do onscreen for decades. When Ria and her sister, the art-school dropout Lena (Ritu Arya), go out for burgers, they wolf them down with memorable gusto.
"Nida came up to us, like, 'Just go for it, eat like you haven't eaten in hours and you cannot wait to get into it,' " Kansara said. "Me and Ritu took the note literally and we went for it. After that take, Nida came back up to us and was like, 'OK, maybe not that much.' "
For Arya (best known as Lila Pitts in the Netflix series "The Umbrella Academy"), being encouraged to chomp was a refreshing change from what she usually sees in movies or on television. "I love watching people eat, but onscreen they are often sort of playing around with their food because of the amount of takes they have to do," she said in a joint chat with Kansara. "Which is why it's satisfying when you see people actually eating. I love that scene for that reason."
Arya was familiar with Manzoor's sensibility because they had worked together before, most notably on the 14-minute comedy "Lady Parts," which Manzoor made for Channel 4 in 2018 and in which Arya played the lead singer of the short film's titular punk band, a raucous quartet of Muslim women. (Because of scheduling conflicts, the part was recast when the short became the series "We Are Lady Parts," which streams on Peacock in the United States; Manzoor is currently writing Season 2.)
Manzoor started writing "Polite Society" around 10 years ago but kept running into obstacles as she tried to get the project off the ground. Very early on, before such suggestions became less acceptable to make, potential financiers would ask if she could make the central family a white one. Others would have preferred something a little bit less action and more art house. Later, the emphasis on comedy became a problem: Couldn't there be some weighty issues like, say, an arranged marriage?
Manzoor did not budge. "It was like, 'It's a joyful film about South Asian Muslim women,' " she said. "So much of the reason I'm a filmmaker is because I want to not have our stories only be about trauma."
Giving "Polite Society" emotional ballast is the bond between Ria and Lena, which was inspired by the one between Manzoor and her own sister, Sanya, who is a year older. (Their brother, Shez, worked on the soundtrack.) After collaborating with Arya on "Lady Parts," Manzoor felt she was a natural fit for the role of Lena. "She has the quality of my oldest sister," Manzoor said, "that natural, inherent sort of alternative brown girl, which is quite rare, actually, in actors. It's kind of mercurial and wild and vulnerable at the same time."
Even a brutal brawl between Ria and Lena, at a low point in their relationship, was inspired by real life. "I used to fight with her -- we used to do martial arts together," Manzoor said of Sanya. "I have this memory of when we were in a martial arts class and our instructor always wanted us to fight when we did sparring." She laughed. "It was kind of creepy."
Asked why she was so keen to put women being active and physical at the heart of her film, Manzoor dug back into her past again.
"I used to love sports, and doing martial arts and dancing," she said. "And then around 12, 13 years old, your body changes and you become objectified. I felt so alienated from my body, so ashamed of it. I realized I'm drawn to genres that allow women to be in possession of their bodies: playing an instrument, being onstage. That was something I lost when I was a teenager, that physicality," she added. "In my art, I'm always trying to show women have it or regain it or find it."

Writers Go on Strike and Late Shows Go Dark

Just hours after the union representing thousands of television and movie writers announced that it was going on strike, hundreds of its members occupied an entire city block in New York on Tuesday.
Gathered outside an NBCUniversal event on Fifth Avenue, the writers chanted “No contract, no content” and held up signs with slogans like “Pencils Down!!!” and “Spoiler Alert: We Will Win.”
“These companies are absolutely destroying our industry,” Tony Kushner, an acclaimed playwright and a screenwriter of movies like “Lincoln” and “The Fabelmans,” said from the picket line, referring to Hollywood studios.
It was a noisy show of solidarity, echoed on picket lines outside the major studios in Los Angeles. But the immediate fallout of the strike — which shattered 15 years of labor peace in the entertainment industry and will bring much of Hollywood’s production assembly line to a halt — was felt most acutely in the world of late-night television, which immediately went dark.
On Tuesday afternoon, NBC issued a statement that the upcoming edition of the “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” would be a repeat from April. “Late Night With Seth Meyers” canceled a show that was supposed to feature an interview with actor Rachel Weisz, replacing it with a rerun from February.
New episodes from late-night shows hosted by Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel have also been suspended. “Saturday Night Live” canceled a new episode scheduled for this weekend with Pete Davidson as host. NBC said it would “air repeats until further notice,” raising the possibility that the show will not be able to end its 48th season with a finale.
How long late-night talk shows stay off the air is an open question. During the last strike, in 2007, late-night shows gradually came back after about two months, even with their writers still on picket lines. (That strike lasted 100 days.)
Kimmel, ABC’s late-night host, was paying his staff out of pocket during that strike, and he said years later that he had to return to air because he had nearly drained his life savings.
David Letterman, who owned his CBS late-night show through his production company Worldwide Pants, made a deal with the Writers Guild of America that allowed his writers to come back on the show.
The other hosts — whose shows were owned by media companies — had no such luck. Hosts like Kimmel and Conan O’Brien returned without their writers, and gamely tried to put together their shows without their standard monologues. O’Brien had to resort to time-killing gimmicks, such as spinning his wedding ring on his desk, setting a timer to it in the process.
Jay Leno, the host of “The Tonight Show,” infuriated Writers Guild of America officials by writing his own monologue jokes. “A Jew, a Christian and a Muslim walk into a bar,” Leno said during his opening monologue, which stretched nearly 10 minutes. “The Jew says to the Muslim, see, I have no idea what they say, because there’s a writers strike.”
Late-night hosts and their top producers have been on group calls in recent weeks, coordinating a response in the event of a strike, according to a person briefed on the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Unlike the enmity of the so-called late-night wars from the 1990s, the hosts have made a concerted effort to show that they are on friendly, if still competitive, terms. When James Corden signed off from “The Late Late Show” last week, there was a taped segment that featured Colbert, Fallon, Kimmel and Meyers all together.
Meyers, the host of NBC’s 12:30 a.m. show, alluded to the devastation of the last strike in a segment late last week.
“It doesn’t just affect the writers,” Meyers said in the web-only video. “It affects all the incredible nonwriting staff on these shows.”
He added that he was a proud member of the Writers Guild of America, and that he felt strongly that what the writers were asking for was “not unreasonable.”
“If you don’t see me here next week, know that it is something that is not done lightly, and that I will be heartbroken to miss you as well,” he said.
The strike would have to stretch for a significantly longer time before viewers began to see the effects on scripted TV shows and movies, because the production process for them can take months or more than a year. But the mere fact that many productions suddenly stopped was a blow to an industry already rocked in recent years by the pandemic and sweeping technological shifts.
The biggest issue for the writers is pay. They have said that their compensation has stagnated even as television production has rapidly grown over the past decade. The unions representing the writers, the East and West branches of the Writers Guild of America, said “the companies’ behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing.”
Writers Guild of America leaders have called this moment “existential,” arguing that the “the survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation.”
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood companies, said in a statement shortly before the strike was announced that its offer included “generous increases in compensation for writers.”
The primary sticking points, according to the studios, involve union proposals that would require companies to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specified period of time “whether needed or not.”
Chris Keyser, a chair of the Writers Guild of America negotiating committee, said in an interview early Tuesday that “philosophically, and practically, we’re very far apart.”
Over the past decade, a period that is often referred to as Peak TV, the number of scripted television shows broadcast in the United States has risen sharply. Writers, however, said that their pay has stagnated.
In the network television era, a writer could get work on a show with more than 20 episodes a season, providing a steady living for an entire year. However, in the streaming era, episode orders have declined to eight or 12, and the median weekly pay for a writer-producer has gone down slightly, the Writers Guild of America said.
“They’re making it impossible for younger writers to make a living,” Kushner said. “Our wages have declined since the last strike.”
The writers want to also fix the formula for residual payments, which have been upended by streaming. Years ago, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed — into syndication or through DVD sales. But global streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have cut off those distribution arms and pay a fixed residual instead.
For now, the writers’ creative energy will be solely dedicated to their picket signs. Outside the NBCUniversal event, one writer held up a sign that read, “Pay your writers or we’ll spoil ‘Succession.’”

Full text: Jhanaë Bonnick and Patrick McDonnell, who both worked in theater, connected on a dating app just before the pandemic began. They grew closer virtually with the help of "36 Questions."
For three weeks after they matched on Hinge in February 2020, Jhanaë K-C Bonnick and Patrick Sean McDonnell tried to make plans to meet, but both were too busy with their jobs in theater. Then the coronavirus pandemic began and everything shut down.
Their first date, on March 19, was a viewing of the film "Always Be My Maybe" using Teleparty (formerly Netflix Party), an extension that allows subscribers in different places to watch TV shows or movies on the streaming service at the same time.
Soon they were texting each other every day. At the time, Ms. Bonnick, a Broadway stage manager, lived in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, and had no work since all the theaters had shut down. She has asthma, so she was nervous about catching Covid-19. "I was in my apartment with my roommate and her cats, just hanging out for a long time," she said. Mr. McDonnell was working remotely for New York Theater Workshop as a special projects associate, and living with his parents in Carle Place, N.Y., where he grew up.
In search of a novel virtual activity for them to try, Mr. McDonnell came across the "36 Questions That Lead to Love." (These are part of a study developed by psychologists to investigate conversations that can build intimacy between two strangers.) In mid-April, he suggested that for their first Zoom date, they ask each other the first 12.
"I was like, lead to ... what?" Ms. Bonnick said. "I'm panicking, texting my friends. What does this mean?"
Over the course of three consecutive Saturdays, they went through the entire list. Each conversation lasted around three hours.
"It works," Ms. Bonnick said. "We fell in love."
Mr. McDonnell said he appreciated that Ms. Bonnick "was willing to answer everything with a lot of vulnerability and thoughtfulness."
Recently, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell looked through the text messages they sent each other during those early months. "We were there for each other through the really weird parts of the pandemic," Ms. Bonnick said.
They found ways to connect outside of the digital world, too. At one point, Ms. Bonnick, who rarely cooked or baked, mailed Mr. McDonnell a tin of homemade snickerdoodle cookies with a handwritten note. "She baked the cookies, she went to the post office in the middle of the pandemic, went to the trouble to overnight ship them," Mr. McDonnell said. "That was the first time I thought, Is this what being in love is like?"
The note Ms. Bonnick sent with the cookies began a tradition that they still keep up with. Every month, on the anniversary of their first date, on March 19, Ms. Bonnick leaves a Post-it note for Mr. McDonnell to find. And Mr. McDonnell writes her notes during the run of each show she works on. (For their wedding, Ms. Bonnick made Mr. McDonnell a box full of notes and photos, and he wrote her a letter and made a digital album of 36 photos, one from every month they had been dating.)
After more than three months of dating from afar, they finally met in person on Memorial Day, at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. "We talked for a long time," Ms. Bonnick said. When they were saying goodbye, both were wearing masks and didn't know how to end the meeting physically. "In normal times, it would be a 'Do we kiss now?"' Ms. Bonnick said. Instead, she said, "There's a weird pause, and Patrick goes, 'Is it OK if we hug?"' Disappointed, Ms. Bonnick went home and told her roommate, "Well, that was nice while it lasted."
Ms. Bonnick was convinced that the hug signified coldness, but she was misreading the signs. Soon after, Mr. McDonnell texted her as usual, and their romance continued. They began seeing each other regularly in person.
That summer delivered a series of painful challenges that solidified their commitment to each other.
Since receiving a bachelor's degree in theater arts from State University of New York at New Paltz in 2014, Ms. Bonnick, 30, has worked in theater. In 2016, she had her big break as the production assistant for "Hadestown" at the show's Off Broadway debut at New York Theater Workshop. She went on to work on shows like "The Cherry Orchard," "Caroline, or Change" and, more recently, "Sweeney Todd." But several months into the pandemic, she was wondering if her career in theater was over. All she could think, she said, was "I've spent five years investing in something that doesn't exist anymore."
She was facing challenges on a personal level as well. In late spring 2020, Ms. Bonnick's maternal grandfather, Joseph Johnson, died, and in August, her paternal grandfather, Keith Bonnick, also died. The Black Lives Matter protests that began in late May raised difficult emotions for Ms. Bonnick. And she and her roommate found out on short notice that they had to move out of their apartment.
Mr. McDonnell, 28, who received a bachelor's degree in theater from Brooklyn College in 2017, had held on to his job for the New York Theater Workshop when the pandemic began. He is currently working full time as a security guard at Madison Square Garden.
That summer, he faced a major health scare. "I had a massive tumor growing along the side of my jaw," he said. "It started the size of a pea and by summer it was the size of a golf ball. I started going for tests. In mid-August, I had surgery to remove it." When he went in for a follow-up, the doctors told him that the lump had been an extremely rare form of cancer called secretory carcinoma. "Luckily it was a clean removal," he said.
Also that summer, Mr. McDonnell's grandfather on his father's side, James McDonnell, died, an event that deeply affected his family.
Throughout it all, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell leaned on each other. He came to Manhattan regularly to join the Black Lives Matter protests or to help out at New York Theater Workshop, which, along with other theaters, decided to open its lobby to give protesters a place to drink water, use the bathrooms or just rest. In the evenings, he would head to Ms. Bonnick's apartment and stay overnight.
That summer "was one of the ways I knew and felt very confident that the relationship was built to last," Mr. McDonnell said. "We spent time together either navigating these things directly or hanging out," he said. "If we wanted an escape, we could have an escape. If we wanted to plan, we could plan. If we just wanted to be safe, we could comfort each other. There wasn't any tension between us."
Ms. Bonnick said that all of the challenges they faced that summer, along with having started a relationship talking on the phone or texting and having done the 36 questions early on, built a foundation of constant communication. Check-ins became a norm. "We don't really fight now," she said. "It's not that we don't disagree. If we disagree, we're just having a different kind of conversation."
Last summer, they started floating the idea of marriage. For Mr. McDonnell, the month of July carries particular significance. On July 2, 2008, when he was 13, Mr. McDonnell almost drowned at Jones Beach. The situation was dire enough that a helicopter evacuated him to a nearby hospital and he was kept there overnight. "Around that time every year I think about what it means to be alive and to have been so close to death," he said. "Last July, I knew I wanted to be married to her and I didn't want to wait much longer."
Ms. Bonnick agreed. So that August, Mr. McDonnell arranged an outing in Port Washington, N.Y., with Ms. Bonnick's parents, Karen and Hugh Bonnick; her brother Jalel Bonnick; his parents, Laura and Peter McDonnell; his aunt and uncle, Linda and Greg Pietrzak; and his cousin Jeffrey Pietrzak. His plan to propose on the dock as the sun set was almost thwarted when the arrival of Ms. Bonnick's family from Staatsburg, N.Y., where her parents live, was delayed. Luckily, they made it, with 20 minutes to spare before nightfall.
"He got down on one knee at the waterfront during sunset and asked me to marry him," Ms. Bonnick said. Afterward, the two families, who were meeting for the first time, went for dinner nearby at Finn MacCool's.
Choosing New York Theater Workshop as the venue for the wedding was easy. Mr. McDonnell worked at the theater for four years, and Ms. Bonnick worked on four shows there, including "Hadestown" and "Slave Play." "That was where we launched our careers and met many of our friends," Ms. Bonnick said. (They never met through work, though Mr. McDonnell knew of Ms. Bonnick.)

On March 19, 2023, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell were wed in the theater's rehearsal room in front of 44 guests. Their friend, Yang-Yang Chen, who was ordained by Open Ministry, officiated. They asked guests to test for Covid-19 if they felt unwell.
When choosing the date for the wedding, Mr. McDonnell and Ms. Bonnick quickly settled on March 19, their anniversary and a Sunday this year. But what they didn't count on was Ms. Bonnick's work schedule.
After the 10:30 a.m. ceremony and a brunch featuring mimosas, crepe cakes from Lady M Cake Boutique, and a coffee truck, Ms. Bonnick rushed across Manhattan, from Fourth Street to the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on West 46th Street, for a 3 p.m. preview performance of "Sweeney Todd." Ms. Bonnick, the show's assistant stage manager, walked in wearing a white, ankle-length JessaKae dress with puff sleeves. "All of my friends, the whole stage management team, were screaming," she said. Afterward, she said, "I checked the props in my wedding dress."
After the show, she met Mr. McDonnell and a small group of friends and family for dinner at Dim Sum Palace on Second Avenue. At some point, Ms. Bonnick and Mr. McDonnell realized that besides being their anniversary, March 19 was also the last day of winter this year. "It was the perfect time for a new beginning," Ms. Bonnick said.

A Shared Commitment Mr. McDonnell and Ms. Bonnick will take each other's last names, both becoming Bonnick-McDonnell. It was an "important statement of values for us, another marker of the commitment we are making together," Mr. McDonnell said.
In Their Words As part of the ceremony, the couple asked guests to read passages of a poem called "A Spell for Reclaiming the Moment" by Adrienne Maree Brown. Ms. Bonnick's close friend and former roommate, Madeleine Foster Bersin, read a passage from bell hooks's "All About Love: New Visions." "We wanted a balance between it feeling like a traditional ceremony and it feeling distinctly our own," Mr. McDonnell said.
Rebirth For their rings, the couple chose aquamarine, the birthstone for March.

Moving Past the Joan Didion Myth: [Style Desk]

Full text: On Tuesday night, a procession of writers, editors and publishing-industry veterans stepped past the lions outside the New York Public Library's main branch on Fifth Avenue as they made their way to a dinner celebrating the acquisition of the archives of Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne.
The vast collection, which the library bought in January for an undisclosed price, contains manuscripts, family photos, recipes and financial documents that provide a glimpse into Ms. Didion's private life and creative process. At the time of her death at 87 in 2021, she was one of the nation's most vaunted writers, and the archive contains everything from letters she wrote to her parents when she was a student at the University of California, Berkeley, to drafts of her books, including "The Year of Magical Thinking" and "Blue Nights."
Combined with the papers of her husband, Mr. Dunne, who died at 71 in 2003, Ms. Didion's will be made available to the public in two years. The collection will allow biographers an intimate look at one of the country's most celebrated literary couples. Mr. Dunne, a noted journalist and novelist, was Ms. Didion's closest collaborator, and the archive includes guest lists for their dinner parties, their edits of each other's manuscripts and screenplay drafts of films they wrote together like "The Panic in Needle Park" and "Play It as It Lays."
In a grand hall on the library's third floor, guests mingled by cocktail tables decorated with framed recipes typed up by Ms. Didion for a melon salad with mint and cucumbers, "Mexican Chicken" and other dishes.
"She took entertaining seriously and was almost militaristic with her recipes," said the archive's acquiring curator, Julie Golia, as a waiter offered a tray of eggplant Parmesan snacks. "She was precise about how each recipe should be delivered. The conversations that must have happened at those dinner parties, you can only imagine."
Under a glass display was more Didion ephemera -- Christmas cards to the writer Tom Wolfe and her letters to editors she worked with, including Robert Silvers at The New York Review of Books and Henry Robbins at Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
"Sorry I took so long," she wrote to Mr. Robbins in 1967, not long before the publication of her nonfiction collection "Slouching Towards Bethlehem." "Part of the problem was that in re-reading the pieces I got mad all over again about those dropped clauses and missing commas. Also I read through a lot of stuff (not on this list) I could not could not could not stand and nobody to blame but myself."
Soon, the guests sat at banquet tables, where they were served a kale salad inspired by one of Ms. Didion's own preparations. From a stage, the actress Candice Bergen and her daughter, the Vogue writer Chloe Malle, read letters that Ms. Didion wrote to her parents after moving to New York from California in the 1950s.
In a letter read by Ms. Bergen, Ms. Didion recounted her romance with Manhattan, trying to conquer her shyness, watching teenage boys dive into the East River at night and her dates with a man named Jerry, whose marriage proposal she rejected because she considered him dull.
Many of those present had known Ms. Didion personally, but seemingly all of them listened with fascination: The letters revealed Ms. Didion when she was just another struggling writer, long before her authorial persona had become at least as famous as her work.
Part of Ms. Didion's enduring appeal has to do with her chic image and the enigma that went with it -- behind the sunglasses, beneath the myth, who was she? In an onstage conversation with the writer Sloane Crosley, Ms. Didion's nephew, the actor, director and producer Griffin Dunne, suggested that the archive might satisfy that curiosity for younger fans.
"Now she's a figure on tote bags, almost like a ubiquitous Che Guevara figure," Mr. Dunne said. "But people, they always want to know what she was like, and that's what these letters are. All those girls in the subway carrying Joan Didion books, now they'll have a place to go find out."
During the sit-down dinner, Mr. Dunne, who directed the 2017 Netflix documentary "Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold," reflected further on the lore surrounding his aunt.
"Did she have self-awareness of it?" he said. "I think she understood what that photo of her standing in front of the Stingray was. With the cigarette and loose hair. She was conscious of where she fit into the culture. She made no secret of her ambition."
Taking in the night over a plate of brick chicken served with brown-butter sauce was Calvin Trillin, a longtime staff writer for The New Yorker and a close friend of Ms. Didion's.
"Despite all the stories about her as a kind of spirit, underneath that ethereal image, she had a very practical side," Mr. Trillin said. He recalled how she had been the president of her Upper East Side co-op's board and how she and her husband appreciated routine when it came to eating out, favoring old-guard restaurants like Elio's.
At night's end, the guests walked through the library's empty halls, their chatter echoing as they headed into a warm spring night. One of them was Steven M.L. Aronson, an author of the 2017 biography "Avedon: Something Personal," who lived near Ms. Didion on the Upper East Side. As he hailed a cab on Fifth Avenue, he recalled accompanying her on walks with her wheaten terrier, Ellie, and his American water spaniel, Quintus.
He paused to consider whether the real Ms. Didion could be found in a heap of documents.
"I think it was probably all myth," Mr. Aronson said. "She made her own legend and she lived it. But through someone's papers and letters, you can see the process of how they created themselves."

Falling in Love Months Before Meeting Face to Face: [Society Desk]

Full text: After matching on Hinge, Nick Matcheck and Lori Hu waited three months before meeting in person. By then, they had already decided to live together in Wisconsin.
Nicholas Brandon Matcheck arrived with a single red rose the first time he met Chunyu Hu face to face in June 2020 on a grand marble staircase in the lobby of the Kimpton Gray Hotel in Chicago.
"There was no initial shyness," said Mr. Matcheck, 40, who described their first kiss minutes later as "very natural."
He had boarded a nearly empty plane in San Francisco that morning, with a one-way ticket and a suitcase, for a weeklong stay in Chicago with Ms. Hu before they moved in together in Green Bay, Wis.
"I already knew what kind of person and partner he was going to be," said Ms. Hu, 38, who had matched with him three months earlier on the dating app Hinge while working remotely from her parents' house in Green Bay -- a temporary move during the Covid-19 lockdown after she felt hemmed in working from her small one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco.
Ms. Hu, who goes by Lori, came to the United States to be with her parents when she was 3 from a village outside Guangzhou, China. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering and a master's in engineering management, both from Duke. She then received a joint master's in international studies and business administration from the University of Pennsylvania.
Ms. Hu, now a managing director at Vertex Ventures Healthcare, a life sciences venture capital fund based in San Francisco, often rolled her eyes during video meetings as she and her co-workers weighed in on the latest episodes of the Netflix reality show "Love Is Blind."
"It just felt so unbelievable," said Ms. Hu, who was skeptical of couples who can develop relationships and become engaged before actually seeing each other.
Her tune changed somewhat when one of her first Hinge matches in March 2020 was Mr. Matcheck.
Mr. Matcheck, whose previous marriage ended in divorce, was completing a master's in business administration at the University of California, Berkeley. He graduated cum laude with a bachelor's in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles, and also received a master's in international affairs from the University of California, San Diego.
From 2007 to 2016, Mr. Matcheck, who goes by Nick, was a naval aviator. He flew a Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft, in the U.S. Navy, and was deployed to the Middle East and Latin America. A son of an Air Force fighter pilot, he was born in Madrid and is now based in San Francisco as a product manager at Supernal, Hyundai's advanced air mobility subsidiary.
They began speaking daily and bonded over '90s music like Savage Garden's "I Knew I Loved You." Their virtual dates included watching nostalgic films that hit home like "An Officer and a Gentleman" and "Sleepless in Seattle," and they soon even began exchanging good, old-fashioned love letters.

Though they had exchanged photos from their lives, "we didn't want to do FaceTime or video," said Ms. Hu, explaining that they wanted to save that 'aha!' moment for when they met face to face.
The couple planned a picnic by the Golden Gate Bridge for late April 2020, when Ms. Hu was set to return to San Francisco, which did not come to pass. On April 22, the night before her birthday, her father was rushed to the I.C.U. with Covid, and then her mother was also infected and hospitalized for a week.
"Nick would talk me through the night," said Ms. Hu, who sometimes dozed off on the phone.
She and her mother, who recovered after a couple of weeks, often stood outside the hospital to be close to her father. After 30 days in the I.C.U., her father died on a muggy day in May.
"You never know what happens in life," she said, quoting one of the last things her father told her.
In a surprise twist, after Mr. Matcheck graduated that spring and his lease was up, the Civil War-era brick country house Ms. Hu's family owned and rented out became available.
"We spoke about if it made sense for him to move to Wisconsin," she said. "He was onboard."
Mr. Matcheck soon took care of packing up his and Ms. Hu's apartments in San Francisco and put their furniture into storage.
"By the time I saw her apartment, I already knew I was in love with her," he said. "I ate the soup she froze, saw her artwork and arts and crafts," he added. "I respackled her walls."
When they finally met in Chicago, she described it as "a week of firsts," a sort of "rom-com montage," and she had already prepared a picnic for the second day.
"It was a surreal feeling meeting someone you already know and you're in love with," she said.
In January 2022, they moved back to San Francisco.
A few days after Thanksgiving that year, when they put up a Christmas tree, he slipped a ring onto her homemade gingerbread-people ornaments featuring their names. The ring went undetected all day.
That evening he prompted her to check out the battery-powered star atop the tree. As soon as she noticed the ring, Mr. Matcheck, who had made coq au vin to celebrate, was on one knee.
On April 16, Dr. Ling Bei, the bride's best friend, who was ordained by the Universal Life Church for the occasion, officiated the wedding before 80 guests at Viansa Winery in Sonoma, Calif. Ms. Hu's brother played Pachelbel's "Canon in D Major" on the violin as she walked down the aisle.
"It reminded me of her walking down the staircase in Chicago," Mr. Matcheck said. "It had that same speed, the slow deliberate walk. It's the same feeling. I knew it was the life I wanted then. I made the right decision again."

Can Hollywood Go Off Script?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Studios have moved up deadlines for TV writers, and late-night shows are preparing to go dark. But for other segments of the industry, it's business as usual.
Writers scrambling to finish scripts. Rival late-night-show hosts and producers convening group calls to discuss contingency plans. Union officials and screenwriters gathering in conference rooms to design picket signs with slogans like "The Future of Writing Is at Stake!"
With a Hollywood strike looming, there has been a frantic sprint throughout the entertainment world before 11,500 TV and movie writers potentially walk out as soon as next week.
The possibility of a television and movie writers' strike -- will they, won't they, how could they? -- has been the top conversation topic in the industry for weeks. And in recent days, there has been a notable shift: People have stopped asking one another whether a strike would take place and started to talk about duration. How long was the last one? (100 days in 2007-8.) How long was the longest one? (153 days in 1988.)
"It's the first topic that comes up in every meeting, every phone call, and everyone claims to have their own inside source about how long a strike will go on and whether the directors and actors will also go out, which would truly be a disaster," said Laura Lewis, the founder of Rebelle Media, a production and financing company behind shows like "Tell Me Lies" on Hulu and independent movies like "Mr. Malcolm's List."
Unions representing screenwriters have been negotiating with Hollywood's biggest studios for a new contract to replace the one that expires on Monday. The contracts for directors and actors expire on June 30.
"I support the writers," Ms. Lewis said. "It's challenging, though. Just as we are starting to recover from the pandemic, we could be going into a strike."
In recent weeks, television writers have been racing to meet deadlines that studios moved up. Worried about the possibility of having no income for months, some TV writers have been trying to push through new projects -- to get "commenced," Hollywood slang for a signed writing contract, which typically brings an upfront payment.
One prominent talent agent, who like some others in this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said there was a "mad rush" to complete deals before next week. Some writers began removing their personal possessions from studio offices in anticipation of a walkout.
Likewise, studio executives began calling producers last week to tell them to act as if a strike were certain, and to make sure all last-minute tweaks were incorporated into scripts, so production on some series could continue even in the absence of writers on set. Executives have delayed production for other series until the fall in cases where they determined scripts were not entirely ready.
The president of one production company said this week that she was "freaking out" over a TV project in danger of falling apart because the star was available only for a limited period and the script was not ready.
The writers room for the hit ABC sitcom "Abbott Elementary" is supposed to convene on Monday -- the day the contract expires.
"I'm making plans to go back to work when we're supposed to go back to work," said Brittani Nichols, a producer and writer on the show. "And if that doesn't happen, I'll be at work on the picket line."
If there is a strike, which could begin as early as Tuesday, late-night shows, including ones hosted by Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, are likely to go dark. Late-night hosts and their top producers have convened conference calls to discuss a coordinated response in the event of a strike, much as they did during the pandemic.
During the 2007 walkout, late-night shows went dark for two months before they began gradually returning in early 2008, even with writers still on picket lines. Jimmy Kimmel paid his staff out of his own pocket during the strike, and later explained that he had to return to the air because his savings were nearly wiped out.
Mr. Kimmel and other hosts, like Conan O'Brien, gamely tried to put together shows without their writers or their standard monologues. Jay Leno, on the other hand, wrote his own "Tonight Show" monologues, infuriating the writers' unions in the process.
Though there's plenty of uncertainty in TV circles, there are also segments of Hollywood where it has been business as usual.
Executives at streaming services seemed to exhibit what one senior William Morris Endeavor agent called a "frightening, freakish sense of calm," perhaps because they were betting that any strike would be short. Most streaming services have been under pressure to cut costs -- even deep-pocketed Amazon Studios laid off 100 people on Thursday -- and a strike is one quick way to do that: Spending would plummet as production slowed.
"It could lead to notably better-than-expected streaming profitability," Rich Greenfield, a founder of the LightShed Partners research firm, wrote to investors this month.
At several movie studios, there is little sense of alarm, partly because a strike would have almost no impact on the release schedule until next spring. (The movie business works nearly a year in advance.) One movie agent said everyone in her orbit was preparing for the Cannes Film Festival, which begins on May 16 and will include premieres for films like "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny" and "Killers of the Flower Moon," the latest from Martin Scorsese. Many movie executives were also preoccupied with CinemaCon this week, a convention for theater operators in Las Vegas.
"The writers' process is like 18 months to two years away from movies' hitting our cinemas, generally, so you wouldn't see an impact for quite a while," said John Fithian, the departing chief executive of the National Association of Theater Owners. "There is a whole lot of writing already in the can -- or the computer -- for projects the studios are putting into production."
At the Walt Disney Company, the largest supplier of union-covered TV dramas and comedies (890 episodes for the 2021-22 season), more immediate worries have been the focus. Disney began to hand out thousands of pink slips on Monday as part of an unrelated plan to eliminate 7,000 jobs worldwide by the end of June. The company made news again on Wednesday when it sued Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.
During previous union walkouts, television networks ordered more reality programming, which does not fall under the writers' unions jurisdiction. The long-running "Cops" was ordered during the 1988 strike, while the 2007-8 strike helped supercharge shows like "The Celebrity Apprentice" and "The Biggest Loser."
Paul Neinstein, co-chief executive of the Project X production company, which made the most recent "Scream" movie and Netflix's "The Night Agent," said there had been a huge increase in reality TV pitches over the last month, even though his production company was not known for making unscripted television.
"All of a sudden everybody's got a reality show," he said. "And that to me feels very strike-related."

With a Hollywood strike looming, there has been a frantic sprint throughout the entertainment world before 11,500 TV and movie writers potentially walk out as soon as next week.

Full text: An Amazon thriller starring Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Richard Madden is the first in a franchise of interrelated series that will be set, and produced, around the world.
About five years ago, the head of Amazon Studios, Jennifer Salke, called Anthony and Joe Russo with an idea for a different kind of franchise. It would start with an American-made show then eventually expand into multiple other series, set and produced in other countries and filmed in other languages, all connected within the same storytelling universe on Prime Video.
The Russo Brothers were intrigued. As linchpins of the Marvel empire, having directed two Avengers movies and two Captain America movies, they knew all about international reach; Marvel, after all, reaps much of its enormous profit abroad. And they soon came up with the right vehicle: a fast-paced spy thriller that jets around the world, as such stories already tend to do.
The result, or at least the first step, is the six-part first season of "Citadel," debuting Friday. The brisk, often violent action drama is about a global spy network, also called Citadel, charged with keeping the world's peace, often through unpeaceful means. At the center are two agents and smoldering former lovers, Nadia Sinh (Priyanka Chopra Jonas) and Mason Kane (Richard Madden), who must fight to save the organization after a nefarious enemy spy group, known as Manticore, nearly wipes Citadel off the map.
But the flagship American series is just the start: Production has wrapped on the Italian "Citadel," starring Matilda De Angelis ("The Undoing"), and it is already underway on the Indian "Citadel," featuring the Bollywood star Varun Dhawan. For the Russo brothers, who are executive producers on all three series, the franchise was the logical next step in their world-building (and world-spanning) vision.
"We've had the good fortune of being able to tell stories that travel around the globe, and we've seen the effect that those can have on audiences," Anthony Russo said, sitting beside his brother during a video interview last week from London. "But those were Hollywood-centric narratives that traveled. The idea that we could create a story that not only traveled around the world but was created around the world seemed like a very exciting movement forward."
It is an audaciously ambitious plan, a play for world influence that the warring spies of "Citadel" might recognize. Some of the production challenges are already evident.
"It really is like riding a bucking bronco," Joe Russo said. "New ideas are always developing because Italy and India are in different timelines of production." As the other two productions emerge with new ideas, he added, "it's important for us to adjust and make sure that our Easter eggs and our plot threads are all feeding correctly into future stories."
David Weil ("Hunters") replaced the original showrunner, Josh Applebaum, during production. (The Indian and Italian productions have different showrunners.) According to The Hollywood Reporter, reshoots pushed the cost of "Citadel" to more than $ 200 million, which would make it one of the most expensive series ever made. (Amazon did not respond to multiple queries about the show's budget.)
The franchise's international ambitions are apparent immediately in early episodes of the U.S. production. Shooting locations abroad for the first season include London, Morocco and Valencia, Spain. Within the first 10 minutes of the series, Chopra Jonas and Madden banter and bicker in Mandarin, Italian, Spanish and German, a multilingual way to immediately indicate these characters have a past.
Casting was also a crucial part of the international equation. Chopra Jonas is one of India's most famous actresses, and she has also made a name in the United States (including in the ABC drama "Quantico"). Madden, who played Robb Stark in "Game of Thrones," is Scottish. The British actress Lesley Manville ("The Crown," "Phantom Thread") plays the ruthless Manticore head, Dahlia Archer, who also happens to be the British ambassador to the United States.
The global orientation was a big part of the appeal for Chopra Jonas.
"As someone who worked in the Indian film industry, I always wanted our Hindi language movies to transcend borders and move into other diasporas," she said last week in a video interview. "You want your movies to always travel."
She added: "'Citadel' is giving an opportunity to filmmakers around the world to play in the same sand pit and have the same opportunities to tell their stories."
Like "The Bourne Identity" (2002), the first installment in the long-running film series based on the Robert Ludlum novels, "Citadel" turns on a case of amnesia. When, in the pilot, Mason and Nadia nearly die in a fiery train crash, their caustic handler, Bernard (Stanley Tucci), "backstops" them, wiping their memories clean. Mason then spends the next eight years living as another person, Kyle, with a wife (played by the Australian actress Ashleigh Cummings) and young daughter (Caoilinn Springall) and no recollection of his life as a superspy.
Kyle is a nice guy. Mason, not so much. When circumstances conspire to make Mason necessary to Citadel again, the reverse transition makes for a thorny process.
"They share a soul," Madden said. "Mason is inherently selfish and damaged. Kyle is the opposite of that. He's surrounded by love. As the show goes on, you get to see more of Mason and how much he actually is craving love and intimacy with someone."
Here, too, the inherent qualities of the spy genre provided opportunities for deeper exploration. Spies, after all, have no fixed identities: They are many different things to many different people. "Citadel" adds a wrinkle to these already-blurred lines, creating characters whose divided selves go beyond expedient aliases and multiple passports.
Chopra Jonas relished the questions of identity raised by the premise: "How are you going to come to terms with everything that happened in those eight years?" she said. "Who are you as a person now? A culmination of both of those? What kind of humanity do you retain? What about your moral compass? It's a really delicious unpacking of character."
With multiple productions based in multiple countries and a narrative universe that thrives on complexity, the "Citadel" project has no shortage of moving parts. It can all get dizzying and demands careful management in order to keep everything coherent and on track. This, Tucci said, is an area where the Russo brothers excel.
"They're probably the most efficient filmmakers I've ever worked with," said Tucci, who also stars in the Russo-directed sci-fi adventure movie "The Electric State," scheduled to debut on Netflix next year. "They know exactly what they want. You get in, and you do it, and they're collaborative. Then you go: 'OK, 6 o'clock. Time to go home. Did we get everything?' And they got everything. That just doesn't happen."
If the opening salvos connect with audiences, the "Citadel" team hopes to add even more countries and more story lines to the project. If all goes as planned, "Citadel" could attain a reach and scope to match its namesake spy network.
To Madden, it wouldn't feel right otherwise.
"If we're trying to make a show about a spy agency that we say exists in every country in the world," he said, "it only makes sense to have versions of this show from as many countries as we can."

Addicted to Playing Chess? It's All by Design.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stella Schwartz, 16, hopped on the chess bandwagon earlier this year after hearing about the game from her older brother, Hugh, a high school senior in San Francisco. Alex Post, a freshman at the University of Colorado, started playing in February, after some chess-related videos appeared in his Tik Tok feed; then he got his whole fraternity playing.
Many other teenagers and young adults said that they too had recently developed a regular chess habit, although they could not recall how it started. But by all accounts -- from players, parents, teachers, website metrics -- the game's popularity has exploded.
Since early November, the number of daily active users to Chess.com, a website and app where visitors can get chess news, learn the game and play against one another and computer opponents, has jumped from 5.4 million to more than 11 million, rising sharply after the beginning of the year. (In December Chess.com also purchased the Play Magnus Group, a company started by chess world champion Magnus Carlsen that includes a mobile chess app.)
The biggest growth has come from players who are 13 to 17 years old -- 549,000 visited Chess.com in January and February, more than twice as many as in the two months prior, according to a company estimate of traffic. The second-fastest age group in the same period was 18- to 24-year-olds. "It's everyone, every single day," Ms. Schwartz said. "I've seen people play at parties."
Casual observers, as well as newly avid chess players, may attribute the trend to pandemic lockdown and boredom, or perhaps to the popularity of the 2020 Netflix mini-series "The Queen's Gambit." But quietly a grandmaster plan was also unfolding, carefully crafted by Chess.com to broaden the appeal of the game and turn millennials and Gen Z into chess-playing pawns. Were they playing chess, or was chess playing them?
"Everything was targeted right at high school, college and junior high," said Erik Allebest, chief executive officer of Chess.com.
The strategy "was very much deliberate," he said: to erase the perception of chess as a grueling, geeky battle of wits and to package it instead on social media as less intimidating, fun, even funny. The matches offered on Chess.com also play to impatience. Timed games can be played at various lengths: 10 minutes, three minutes or, if that seems interminable, one minute. Still too long? Enjoy a 30-second match! Sometimes, Mr. Allebest said, it's just about sport for sport's sake, "not about getting better."
Soon, before anyone quite knew what had happened, it was game over, and chess had won. "It happened in a really short period of time," Mr. Allebest said of the game's online growth, "thanks to a handful of crazy seeds."
The Opening
Happenstance -- the coronavirus, word of mouth, the handsomeness of Mr. Carlsen -- played a part. From February 2020 to February 2021, usage on Chess.com apps leaped from around 1.5 million daily active users to around 4.5 million.
Behind the scenes, Chess.com was working to change the game's image and attract new players. This was good for business. Although the app allows users to play for free, its financial model relies on charging for tiers of service, from $ 6.99 to $ 16.99 per month for additional features like instructional videos and computer analysis of a player's games and moves. The strategy, simply, was to rebrand chess as good old-fashioned fun.
"When I was a kid, chess was for nerds," Mr. Allebest said. "We started selling the enjoyment of chess and community more than just the top players and news of top players. " In 2020, the site started hosting tournaments with online influencers who were not particularly adept at chess but had large followings among young people. These included xQc, a professional video-game player and streamer; Ludwig, an e-sports streamer; MoistCr1TiKal, another streamer and commentator; and Mr. Beast, a 24-year-old YouTube sensation with 147 million subscribers.
Chess.com hired college students to manage its social media presence. The students were encouraged to be irreverent and funny and to create memes, Mr. Allebest said. A recent blog post on the site was titled "Why chess sucks" and offered as the main reason, "I always lose!"
The site's Instagram account features short, offbeat videos, including the regular appearance of a bearded man in a puffy green pawn costume, who at one point trips over an electrical cord. Joker takes pawn.
The Botez Gambit
Before long, an array of online chess personalities had emerged.
Levy Rozman, 27, is an international master and a lively, charismatic commentator better known as GothamChess; Mr. Allebest described him as a "chess prophet spokesperson for 14- to 25-year-olds." Grandmaster GMHikaru has 1.91 million YouTube followers. Alexandra Botez, 28, another chess celebrity on Twitch and YouTube, earned a particular claim to fame: Once, while streaming a match, she blundered into losing her queen and reacted with an endearing, bemused shock that made the gaffe seem cool. To accidentally lose your queen is now known as the Botez Gambit.
Mr. Post, the freshman at the University of Colorado, said he was drawn in by "a bunch of clips" -- TikTok videos by GothamChess -- at a moment when he was "feeling kind of bored."
That was in early February; now, he plays every day, including sometimes in class. And he himself turned into a chess influencer. At a fraternity event, he said, he asked a frat brother, "'Yo, are you good at chess?"'
"He said, 'Let's play,' and then another dude said, 'I'm decent,' and it was like a domino effect," Mr. Post said.
Mittens to D4
Chess.com allows users to play against other people of their own skill level or against computer programs of various levels, including A.I. opponents that have names and personalities and can be outspoken.
Fabigi, described by Chess.com as a "hardworking Italian American plumber," is an advanced beginner. Boshi, portrayed as a longhaired human with a reptile body, plays at the beginner level and is "everyone's favorite dinosaur sidekick," according to a Chess.com description.
But the mother of all Chess.com bots, introduced only for the month of January, was Mittens, an anime-esque tabby cat with big green eyes that look a little sad. Mittens was advertised by Chess.com as having a chess rating of 1 -- the worst. In reality, Mittens was a stone-cold killer with a sadistic streak.
Mittens was created with world-class skills and was unlikely to lose against the world's top grandmasters. Mittens played slowly, appearing to give the opponent a chance while muttering odd and obnoxious taunts. ("Meow, I am become Mittens, destroyer of kings.")
"We made it strong enough to beat virtually every human player in the world, but not quickly," said Mike Klein, the chief chess officer of ChessKid.com, which is a part of the Chess.com company.
In January, 40 million games were played against Mittens, which Slate described in a headline at the time as "the evil cat bot destroying players' souls."
End Game
Mr. Klein has been traveling the country trying to convince schools to include chess in the curriculum. He argues that chess is good for the brain, but he concedes that the scientific studies he invokes, linking chess with better performance on standardized tests, "are pretty old or don't have a good control group or are not a large enough sample size."
Whether chess offers anything more valuable than other online games do is unclear, said Dr. Michael Rich, an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and the founder of the Digital Wellness Lab, which studies the health aspects of technology use. It all depends, he said, on whether someone is playing with patience, and to learn, or just for quick digital thrills.
Some teachers complain that chess is more of a distraction than a learning tool. "They play it constantly, schoolwide, and it's gotten to the point where they aren't turning anything in and are exclusively playing chess," an anonymous high school teacher said of students in a post on Reddit, where several threads have emerged on the subject. Mastery appeared to be an afterthought, the teacher wrote: "The only thing is ... they're all really, really bad at it? They're absolutely awful."
Ms. Schwartz, the high school sophomore in San Francisco, said that she generally avoided playing in class and that it did benefit her brain. "Chess is a smart game," she said.
Her mother, Emily Stegner-Schwartz, agreed. "I'd rather she play chess than, what's that game, Jewel Crusher or Candy Land," she said, referring to the game Candy Crush. Online chess "is to chess what pickleball is to tennis," she said.
Her son, Hugh, the high-school senior, couldn't recall what first got him playing on Chess.com earlier this year -- friends, maybe? "I don't know, it's weird," he said. Now he plays twice a day. And if there was a corporate strategy to capture him, did it really matter?
"Everybody is manipulating people now on social media," he said. "Chess is not the worst thing to be manipulated into."

C.E.O. Leaving NBCUniversal After an Inquiry: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Comcast, the company's owner, said he was leaving after an investigation into "an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company."
Jeff Shell, the chief executive of NBCUniversal, is leaving the company after an investigation into a complaint about an inappropriate workplace relationship, the company's owner, Comcast, said in a statement on Sunday.
In the statement, Mr. Shell said that Sunday would be his last day and that he had had "an inappropriate relationship with a woman in the company."
Comcast's terse statement did not say who would be replacing Mr. Shell at NBCUniversal, which he has led since 2020.
But in a note to employees on Sunday, Comcast's chief executive, Brian Roberts, said that Mr. Shell's senior team would report to Michael Cavanagh, Comcast's president, putting Mr. Cavanagh in effective control of NBCUniversal.
News of Mr. Shell's exit from NBCUniversal sent texts whizzing across New York and Hollywood, where he commanded Comcast's sprawling entertainment empire. His departure comes at a pivotal time for Comcast, which is navigating the tricky transition from the traditional TV and cable businesses to a future anchored by streaming video, broadband internet and wireless services.
The inquiry into Mr. Shell began in recent weeks after the woman involved in the relationship came forward with a complaint, according to two people familiar with the timeline of the investigation. Mr. Shell continued in his duties while the investigation proceeded, taking previously scheduled meetings with lawmakers in Washington and working on other matters. Mr. Shell was also scheduled to attend the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in Washington with his wife next Saturday.
The investigation, conducted by an outside law firm, was not widely known at Comcast until its conclusion, according to three people familiar with the matter. Mr. Roberts and Mr. Cavanagh called executives who directly work with Mr. Shell over the weekend to tell them Mr. Shell was leaving and to brief them on the leadership transition.
In the statement on Sunday, Mr. Shell said, "I'm truly sorry I let my Comcast and NBCUniversal colleagues down, they are the most talented people in the business and the opportunity to work with them the last 19 years has been a privilege."
Mr. Roberts said in his note to employees: "We are disappointed to share this news with you. We built this company on a culture of integrity. Nothing is more important than how we treat each other."
The stunning departure of Mr. Shell, 57, marks an abrupt about-face for him after a nearly two-decade rise at Comcast. Mr. Shell had risen steadily through the ranks at the cable company-turned-media-behemoth, becoming chief executive of NBCUniversal in 2020 after his predecessor, Steve Burke, stepped down.
Before becoming the top executive, Mr. Shell had a number of high-profile roles at the media division. In 2013, he was tapped to lead the Universal film studio, which Comcast had recently acquired in a megadeal with G.E. He succeeded Ron Meyer, a longtime Universal executive, who left the company in 2020 after he said he was the victim of an attempt to "extort" him that was related to a past extramarital affair.
In Mr. Cavanagh, 57, Mr. Roberts has turned to a close confidant whose stock has risen steadily at Comcast since he joined the company in 2015. Last year, Mr. Cavanagh was appointed president of Comcast -- the third person to hold that position in the company's history -- and is widely viewed internally as the most likely internal candidate to succeed Mr. Roberts as chief executive.
Even before his sudden departure on Sunday, Mr. Shell's status as chief executive of NBCUniversal had, at times, been uncertain. Last year, Comcast discussed combining NBCUniversal with Electronic Arts, a deal that could have resulted in a new role for Mr. Shell at Comcast, according to two people familiar with the talks. Ultimately, that deal was never consummated, and Mr. Shell stayed on as the head of the media division.
Peacock, NBCUniversal's streaming service, has had some momentum in recent months, but remains small compared with its peers. Peacock has more than 20 million paid subscribers, significantly fewer than Netflix (232 million) or Warner Bros. Discovery's offerings of HBO Max and Discovery+ (96 million). Some of the major media companies' streaming businesses are still losing money, and Peacock is no exception. It lost around $ 2.5 billion last year, and is projected to lose another $ 3 billion this year.
NBCUniversal also owns many cable networks, including Bravo, E!, MSNBC and USA, which are facing a decline in traditional TV viewership. NBC, its broadcast network, has also lost viewers for its prime-time programming.
While not the largest movie studio in Hollywood, Universal Pictures has been quite successful. Highlights from 2022 included "Jurassic World: Dominion" and "Minions: Rise of Gru." This year started even stronger, with "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" closing in on $ 900 million in worldwide ticket sales after only three weekends in theaters, making it the company's highest-grossing animated film in its history.
Other highly anticipated films set for release this year include the 10th iteration of the "Fast and Furious" franchise along with Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated "Oppenheimer," about the famed nuclear physicist. The studio has also started a flexible distribution strategy that uses a staggered rollout between theaters and its streaming service, Peacock, for bigger films. For smaller titles, like "Marry Me," starring Jennifer Lopez, and the horror film "Firestarter," which both came out last year, the theatrical and streaming debuts are simultaneous.
The company's theme parks have also been a bright spot, with higher attendance and guest spending leading to record profits last year. The company plans to open theme parks in Las Vegas and Frisco, Texas, in the next several years.
NBCUniversal's news group, which includes MSNBC, NBC News and CNBC, is trying to make up for sector-wide declines in traditional viewership with an advertising-supported news streaming service, NBC News Now, and new products for subscribers, including the CNBC Pro service. It has notched some programming wins, including "Inside With Jen Psaki," a new Sunday show hosted by the former White House press secretary.
The company is set to report quarterly earnings this week, and the conference call that follows is likely to be closely scrutinized.

One Start-Up Thinks Text Messages Could Be Next Social Media: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Community, which was first marketed as a way for celebrities to text their fans, now has big brands on board.
Andrew here. You probably received today's DealBook newsletter, as you always do, by email. But you probably got a bunch of spam and junk mail in your inbox, too.
That's why so many of us are moving our most important communications to text messages. And in the process, the "text inbox" has become the new holy space for brands, far more intimate than your social media feed.
At least, that's the bet that Ashton Kutcher, the actor turned venture capitalist, and Guy Oseary, Bono's and Madonna's manager turned investor, made when they co-founded a text message company called Community in 2019. In the beginning, it was marketed to celebrities to communicate with their fans about tour dates and new projects.
But over the last year, the business has quietly grown to power text messages from some of the largest brands, like McDonald's, HBO, the New York Yankees and Condé Nast. When this month's Hollywood blockbuster, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," launched an advertising campaign, it came with a phone number for viewers to text, powered by Community.
The company plans to announce next week that it has raised another $ 25 million, bringing its total fund-raising to $ 110 million, from investors such as Salesforce Ventures, Morgan Stanley Next Level Fund and Verizon Ventures. (It did not disclose its latest valuation.)
It also made Robert Wolf, a former chairman of UBS Group Americas, who served as an informal adviser to President Barack Obama, its new chairman. He started helping to sign up large corporate customers over the past year, bringing the total clients to over 8,000. The company is run by Diankha Linear, a longtime executive who served as an Army logistics and transportation officer.
Community has gained its latest funding as questions have increasingly arisen about social media's reach and how companies can own the digital relationship with their customers without a middleman like Facebook or Twitter.
"I started out with Twitter and built a fairly large following on Twitter," said Mr. Kutcher, who has 16.8 million followers. "But Twitter today is very different than what Twitter was when I originally started playing around it," he added. "The click-through rates are massively degraded -- the number of people that actually see the post is massively degraded."
At Community, in contrast, "we have like 45 percent click-through rates and 98 percent open rates," Mr. Kutcher said. "You don't get that in social environments because most people don't even see the things you're posting."
Community competes with a bevy of different types of services vying for space in your text inbox, from Attentive to Twilio to Zendesk. And many of the software platforms that companies use to manage their relationships with customers now have features that facilitate texting.
But what sets Community apart is the dialogue that celebrities and brands have with their customers, who provide troves of information about themselves, which the brand owns and isn't shared with Community's other clients.
Oseary was originally drawn to Community because of his role as a music manager, he said.
"I have no way to know who came to the concert tonight. I have no way to speak to them again once they leave the concert. I have no way to know who bought the album," he said. "With Community, once they text the number, we now have a way to stay in touch directly. And that information is not owned by anyone but the artist, the talent or the person who's building a business."
Companies advertise a phone number that users text to sign up for updates. McDonald's posted its number on a billboard in Times Square just this month. The service also allows brands to segment customers who sign up for texts, so if an artist has an concert coming up in Atlanta, only people in Atlanta get the texts.
Using text messages to connect with customers, for all its promise, poses unique challenges. Brands are required to get their customers to opt in to messages, which is hard to do unless the brand is already well established. And customers may want to hear from fewer brands in their text inbox than they do in their email inbox.
"As opposed to email, when you have to scroll to the bottom of the thing and hit the link that says unsubscribe, if you don't like the text messages you're getting, you only have to write one word: Stop," Mr. Kutcher said. (That's some news you can use.)
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Rupert Murdoch makes another deal. Fox News settled a defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems at the last minute for $ 788 billion. The deal allowed Murdoch and his company's executives to avoid having to testify, but it also handed Staple Street, the private equity owner of Dominion, a big payday after it bought the company for $ 38 million in 2018. His son Lachlan, C.E.O. of Fox Corporation, also settled a separate defamation suit against an Australian publisher this week.
Return to sender. Netflix ended its DVD delivery service after 25 years. The streaming company's original business model revolved around sending discs by mail, and at its peak, in 2010, about 20 million subscribers used the service. The company announced the changes as it reported first-quarter profits of $ 1.3 billion, up 4 percent year on year.
Gary Gensler gets a grilling. The chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, was hammered by Republicans over the agency's handling of the cryptocurrency industry, in an appearance before the House Financial Services Committee. Gensler defended the regulator, saying he had never seen a sector break so many securities laws with such regularity, after being accused of failing to spot problems at FTX before the cryptocurrency exchange collapsed.
China's economy bounces back, kind of. In its first full quarter since Beijing lifted punishing Covid restrictions, the world's second-largest economy beat expectations on the back of surging consumer spending, rising exports and government-led infrastructure spending. But youth unemployment hit 19.6 percent, its second-highest mark on record, suggesting that businesses are not convinced that Beijing is finished dabbling in the private sector and that economic uncertainty is over.
Goldman Sachs quickens its retail banking U-turn. The Wall Street giant reported lackluster first-quarter returns and accelerated its retreat from consumer banking, including putting its GreenSky unit up for sale just a year after buying the lending company for $ 2.2 billion. One spot of new business: The bank introduced a savings account with Apple that offers a 4.15 percent annual interest rate -- more than 10 times the national average.
BMW gets into hot water over ice cream. The German carmaker was forced to apologize after being accused of discriminating against Chinese visitors to the Shanghai auto show this week. Images went viral on Chinese social media of workers at its booth appearing to give free ice cream to a western man after telling ethnic Chinese attendees that they had run out.
Term of the week: 'Greenhushing'
Ever since Earth Day was established in 1970, companies have advertised their green initiatives on April 22. But with many Republicans now taking a strong stand against corporate environmentalism and targeting companies that publicize their climate change-related goals, you might see fewer companies touting their green credentials this year. Instead, some businesses are resorting to "greenhushing." An analysis of 1,200 companies published last fall by South Pole, a Swiss consultancy, found that one in four planned to go green but then "go dark" -- that is, keep its green goals under the radar.
A.I., the artist
Artificial intelligence has had a creative few weeks: A song that used A.I. to mimic the voices of Drake and The Weeknd went viral; a murder-mystery novel penned using A.I. is available to preorder; and an image generated by A.I. won one of the world's biggest photography prizes. DealBook wrote last week that A.I. was creating thorny copyright issues, but it is also raising questions about the nature of human creativity itself.
Companies have tried to draw lines between human and machine-generated work. Streaming services, including Spotify and Apple Music, pulled the tech-created song from their platforms this week. And Universal Music Group urged the services to block A.I. from scraping its songs for use as training data.
Some artists see creative possibilities rather than threats. Stephen Marche, who wrote the cheekily titled "Death of an Author" novel using three A.I. programs, compared the process to composing hip-hop: "You don't necessarily know how to drum, but you definitely need to know how beats work, how hooks work, and you need to be able to put them together in a meaningful way," he told The New York Times. "I am the creator of this work, 100 percent," Marche said, "but, on the other hand, I didn't create the words."
Who is the creator? Boris Eldagsen, the Berlin artist whose A.I.-generated "Pseudomnesia: The Electrician" won the creative open category at the Sony World Photography Awards, told DealBook that making the image had been like directing a film.
"On a movie there is a set director, there is a cameraman, and there is an actress and a story writer, and I tell them which direction to go," he said. "I am the one, as an artist, who needs to connect all of this to the world, the human condition."
He entered the competition to kick-start a conversation about separating the art of photography from A.I.-generated art, which he considers co-creation.
But who should take credit for this type of collaboration? Generative A.I. is informed by reference material created by human artists. It becomes more complicated when A.I. is used to imitate a particular performer, or a specific artist's drawing style. Last month, the Recording Industry Association of America launched a "human artistry campaign," which argues that the makers of A.I. need to license copyrighted work they use as training data. And Holly Herndon, a musician, started a company to build consent guidelines for the tech. "The creative possibilities there are fascinating and will change art forever," she told The Times. "We just have to figure out the terms and tech."
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

The Loss of Innocence Is in the Air: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A whiff of strawberry sweetness hits you as soon as you walk into "The Pink Bedroom," an exhibit at the Museum of Sex in New York. The installation is a jumble of shocking pink objects (stuffed animals, makeup compacts, music boxes, shoes and sex toys) arranged around a bed made with pink sheets and pillows. But it also features a mishmash of smells: rose, baby powder and ... is that cat pee?
The artist Portia Munson has exhibited different versions of "The Pink Bedroom," a diorama that explores girlhood and femininity, since 1994. Her show at the Museum of Sex, which runs through July, is the first time the installation has had a signature scent.
It was created by Marissa Zappas, 36, a perfumer in Brooklyn. Ms. Zappas, who has a namesake line, has developed a reputation for creating fragrances with atypical collaborators like sex workers, poets and astrologers, most of whom are women.
"The Pink Bedroom" perfume -- small bottles of which cost $ 45 -- has, in a way, been years in the making: Ms. Zappas first approached Ms. Munson, 62, about working on a project together in 2018. Ms. Zappas loosely modeled the scent after the smell of Cupcake Dolls, a type of fragrant toy popular in the 1990s.
A theme of "The Pink Bedroom" exhibition is the loss of innocence, and Ms. Zappas wanted the perfume to reflect that. To balance the sweetness evoked by its floral and fruity notes, Ms. Zappas added cassis bud, which has an acrid smell that she said is often mistaken for that of cat pee.
"There are these classic pink 'girlie' smells, but then there is also something that feels unsettling, uncomfortable," Ms. Zappas said recently while standing inside "The Pink Bedroom" installation, into which her perfume is pumped through a diffuser.
Ms. Munson said that Ms. Zappas understood "'The Pink Bedroom' is meant to be very seductive and beautiful, but also a little bit too much and a little yucky."
Jane Dashley, who reviews perfumes for Fragraphilia, a fragrance website that she helped found, said that Ms. Zappas specializes in scents that are "uniquely feminine, like a fairy tale, ballerina, bows-and-ribbons kind of feminine." But, Ms. Dashley said, there is a darkness under the surface.
Latex and Leather
In 2019 Ms. Zappas created a fragrance inspired by "Porn Carnival: Paradise Edition," a book of love poems by Rachel Rabbit White. After reading the book, Ms. Zappas contacted Ms. White and the two developed Paradise Edition, a scent with notes of jasmine, orange blossom and salt water.
In 2021, Ms. Zappas released "Wh*re," a perfume inspired by "Whore of New York," a memoir by Liara Roux about her sex work. Ms. Roux said that the fragrance, which smells of cherry, rose and leather, evoked "the nasty, visceral fleshiness and the surreal glamour" of her book.
"I asked her to make a scent that captured the feeling of just having worked -- something that smelled like money, condoms and sex," said Ms. Roux.
Ms. Zappas said that although perfume has a history of being used as a tool of seduction, "sexy" can mean different things -- or smells -- to different people. She is less interested in defining what sex smells like than she is in exploring the ways and reasons people wear perfume. "Sex is a major one," she added.
A fragrance called Annabel's Birthday Cake, with notes of whipped cream and latex, is her most popular, Ms. Zappas said. She created it with her friend Annabel Gat, an astrologer who was born one day after Ms. Zappas.
Ms. Zappas runs her business from her apartment in Brooklyn, where part of her living room has become a perfume lab. Small bottles and vials of aroma chemicals cover the desk where she works, and just a few feet away is a stripper pole, which Ms. Zappas installed after a breakup. "Dancing really helps take me back into my body and not think so much," she said.
While discussing what led her to become a perfumer, Ms. Zappas plunked a framed photo of the actress Elizabeth Taylor down onto a coffee table. The picture was from a collection that she said at one point totaled some 1,200 photos of the actress, whose eyes were the inspiration for a pair of tattoos Ms. Zappas has on her inner arms.
Ms. Zappas became fascinated with Taylor as a child, after seeing "National Velvet." When she later learned of Taylor's foray into the fragrance business, Ms. Zappas said it intensified her interest in perfume.
Ms. Zappas, who was born in Southern California and raised in the Bay Area, said she has been obsessed with scents since childhood, when she would spend time at a fig orchard planted by her father.
She moved to New York City in 2011, to study at the New School. In early 2015, she started a temp job as a receptionist at the New York office of Givaudan, a fragrance company that has developed perfumes for Coach, Estée Lauder and Tom Ford, among others.
During that job, Ms. Zappas applied for an apprenticeship with one of Givaudan's master perfumers, Olivier Gillotin. At the time she applied for the apprenticeship, Ms. Zappas was studying cemetery construction. "I was learning about the history of deodorization," she said.
Mr. Gillotin said her studies were much different from anyone else's he had met working in the industry. She began her apprenticeship with him around the time of her graduation in 2015. When it ended, he advised her to strike out on her own, telling her then that she could make more of a mark on the industry from the outside than the inside.
Feeling Alive
Most of Ms. Zappas's perfumes are produced in limited quantities and start at about $ 150 a bottle. She also takes commissions for custom fragrances, a service that starts at about $ 4,000 a bottle (refills cost about $ 200).
To develop a custom perfume, Ms. Zappas probes clients' memories for scent associations. "This is my favorite part, learning about their specific memories from childhood, like what foods their mother made, or what their backyard smells like," she said.
Sera Gamble, a creator of the Netflix series "You," commissioned a perfume last July after discovering Ms. Zappas's products on Instagram. "I was so taken with the idea that she collaborates with poets and astrologers," Ms. Gamble, 39, said.
The fragrance is still in development. "Perfume is ideally slow," Ms. Zappas said.
She is also working on "Maggie the Cat is Alive, I'm Alive!," a perfume with notes of violets, peaches and champagne. The name is from dialogue by Elizabeth Taylor in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof."
"I'm finally feeling more settled, with enough confidence to make a fragrance worthy of her," Ms. Zappas said.
She added, "Quite honestly, I just feel alive."

The Crypto Detectives Are Cleaning Up: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Before a new breed of cryptocurrency detectives helped bring him down, Ryan Felton marketed his crypto scheme with a grandiose promise: He was creating "Netflix on the blockchain."
He called the crypto-themed streaming service FLiK. For a small amount of the popular digital currency Ether, customers could purchase a FLiK token, which would give them access to shows and movies broadcast on the new platform. Mr. Felton described the project as an "entertainment revolution"; crypto enthusiasts bought more than $ 2 million worth of FLiK coins.
But the streaming business never materialized. Instead, Mr. Felton bought a $ 1.5 million house, along with $ 32,000 in diamonds. He spent $ 180,000 more on a red Ferrari.
When cryptocurrencies hit the mainstream in the 2010s, the technology was widely viewed as a perfect vehicle for crime. A drug dealer or scam artist could transfer large quantities of money instantly, without relying on a bank to validate the transaction. To early advocates, crypto was appealing because it promised the secrecy and anonymity of cash, without the inconvenience of face-to-face exchanges.
That secrecy was an illusion. Crypto transactions are inscribed on a publicly viewable ledger called a blockchain. To the untrained observer, blockchain records are unintelligible -- a jumble of meaningless letters and numbers. But a growing industry is dedicated to deciphering them.
At the center is the New York analytics start-up Chainalysis, which was valued at $ 8.6 billion after a funding round last year. With tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts, Chainalysis has built a reputation as one of the crypto industry's leading detectives -- a team of blockchain analysts that helps the government track crypto transactions.
As federal agencies orchestrate an aggressive crackdown on crypto fraud, Chainalysis has come to occupy an increasingly important position in the industry. The company markets itself to the government and private companies as a force for good in a badly behaved sector -- a firm whose business is solving crimes and cooperating with public officials.
After the FTX exchange imploded, its bankruptcy lawyers hired Chainalysis to disentangle the web of entities at the center of Sam Bankman-Fried's empire and track the $ 400 million in crypto that a hacker stole from FTX's accounts. Chainalysis has also been conducting some light diplomacy: In April, it hosted a conference in Manhattan to bring together government officials and the newly chastened crypto executives who are trying to win back their trust. Guests received socks stitched with the Chainalysis logo.
But that ambassadorial role has also put Chainalysis at odds with some of crypto's most passionate advocates, who envisioned digital money as a private, anonymous financial network. That clash is a battle for crypto's future, and it's unfolding at a turbulent moment in the industry's short history.
From the government's perspective, Chainalysis is arguably the most trusted company in the industry -- but only because it sells powerful tools aimed at penetrating the veil of secrecy that made crypto attractive in the first place.
The blockchain is "oftentimes the key to unlocking a case," said Jonathan Levin, 32, one of the founders of Chainalysis. "It's more traceable and more conclusive."
In late 2020, Mr. Felton was indicted on charges that he had used investors' funds to finance his extravagant lifestyle. He went on trial in Atlanta last summer. Testifying for the prosecution was Beth Bisbee, a Chainalysis investigator who once worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2014, her analysis of blockchain records helped the D.E.A. track down an internet drug dealer in Arizona.
That investigation was relatively low-tech: Ms. Bisbee pasted Bitcoin transaction logs into a spreadsheet, which she searched for clues. These days, crypto fraud is more complicated, involving multiple types of currencies, each with its own blockchain. Chainalysis makes software that can do the time-consuming work automatically.
In the courtroom, Ms. Bisbee presented a colorful diagram mapping the movement of the millions of dollars' worth of Ether that investors spent on Mr. Felton's tokens. The funds had been routed to a series of crypto wallets, digital repositories where people can store their holdings. Using a forensic technique called clustering, Ms. Bisbee showed that all those wallet addresses belonged to the same person: Mr. Felton. From those accounts, he had moved his investors' Ether to one exchange before transferring it to another. Then he'd converted the Ether into cash.
"What was the source of the vast bulk of those funds before they were wired out?" one of the prosecutors asked Ms. Bisbee.
"The FLiK token sales," she replied.
The prosecution presented its case over four days in July. On the last day, Mr. Felton pleaded guilty.
A new kind of crypto business
About a decade ago, Mr. Levin, then a master's student in economics at Oxford University, was at a pub with a friend when the conversation turned, naturally, to the topic of cryptocurrency arbitrage. Variations in the price of Bitcoin across two exchanges had created a moneymaking opportunity: Buy Bitcoin at the lower price, then sell it for a profit.
The arbitrage trade proved too time-consuming and logistically complicated for Mr. Levin to execute. "I probably had, like, 100 pounds to my name," he said. But the conversation ignited Mr. Levin's fascination with Bitcoin. The digital currency was invented in 2008 by a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto, who envisioned a private, decentralized form of commerce that would operate outside the supervision of any government or financial institution.
Mr. Levin was no radical libertarian, however. A 20-something from the United Kingdom, he was interested in the inner workings of the technology, and he saw an opportunity for professional advancement: Not many other people seemed to be studying cryptocurrencies. At the time, Bitcoin was still considered the domain of hackers and drug dealers; none of Mr. Levin's professors wanted to supervise his research.
Undeterred, Mr. Levin started attending crypto conferences and eventually wrote a master's thesis titled, "Creating a decentralised payment system: A study of Bitcoin." But he still had questions.
"No one understood how and why people were actually using crypto," Mr. Levin said. "If you could package that information up and supply that to all of the most important stakeholders, you can build systemically one of the most important companies."
While he was still at Oxford, Mr. Levin started a blockchain analytics company called Coinometrics, but it soon fizzled. ("It's probably not the best idea to meet your co-founders on Reddit," he said.) Then, in early 2015, he was introduced to Michael Gronager and Jan Moller, Danish entrepreneurs who were working on a similar project. Mr. Gronager had been using blockchain analysis to track crypto lost in the collapse of Mt. Gox, an early exchange. Together, the three men founded Chainalysis.
As the crypto industry has expanded, blockchain tracking has become increasingly important. These days, some of the largest crypto companies hire blockchain analytics firms to help monitor their customers' activity and comply with laws designed to stop money laundering. In bankruptcy proceedings, analytics firms sort through the remains of collapsed crypto companies, investigating public transaction logs to locate missing funds.
The crypto industry's recent downturn has taken a toll on the tracking business. Elliptic, one of Chainalysis' competitors, cut 10 percent of its staff in February. The same month, Chainalysis laid off about 40 employees, a roughly 5 percent cut.
But blockchain analysis companies have been insulated from the worst effects of the market crash. Chainalysis declined to reveal its exact sales figures, but Mr. Gronager said the company's revenue increased 70 percent last year despite the crisis in crypto markets. That growth is partly a function of the company's business model: Two-thirds of its revenue comes from partnerships with public institutions, including law-enforcement agencies, the company says, a source of income that remains relatively stable even when the market implodes.
The Justice Department paid Chainalysis $ 12,500 for its work on the Ryan Felton case, according to federal records. But that assignment was a drop in the bucket. The Justice Department, the Treasury Department and other federal agencies pay for the ability to use Chainalysis' blockchain-tracing software, including a tool called Reactor, which maps transactions. In total, Chainalysis has active contracts with the federal government worth about $ 65 million, according to an analysis of federal records by Jack Poulson, the executive director of the nonprofit Tech Inquiry, which tracks contracts.
Lately, though, Chainalysis has faced competition from smaller rivals including TRM Labs, a tracking firm that has gained prominence by selling software for new types of cryptocurrencies with names like Solana.
In 2021, an official at TRM emailed the Treasury Department to question its decision to award an exclusive contract to Chainalysis, according to email logs obtained through a public records request.
The TRM representative asked for a "rationale as to why this procurement isn't following a competitive bid process," according to the emails. "There are multiple providers with analogous capabilities that meet" the requirements, the representative wrote. By early last year, TRM had secured its own contract with the Treasury Department, according to a company spokeswoman. And TRM was hired alongside Chainalysis to work on FTX's bankruptcy.
"We went from a Bitcoin world to this multi-chain world, and people needing tools to follow illicit activity no matter where it happens in the crypto economy," said Esteban Castaño, TRM's chief executive. "There's constantly going to be new assets, new blockchains."
Fighting for privacy
At times, the transparency of the blockchain has been a boon to law enforcement. In 2020, Chainalysis worked with U.S. investigators to bring down the largest child-pornography website on the dark web. By analyzing the blockchain, agents located the digital addresses of customers who were using Bitcoin to buy the illegal pornography. The trail led to the crypto exchanges where the customers had bought their Bitcoin in the first place; the government could then subpoena those firms to establish the wallet owners' identities.
Despite those kinds of law-enforcement victories, the rapid growth of blockchain-tracking firms has provoked some uneasiness in the crypto world. One of Chainalysis's government clients is Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has an active contract with the company worth a total that could rise to roughly $ 12 million, according to federal records. An I.C.E. spokesman did not respond to requests for comment; Mr. Gronager, the Chainalysis founder, said the agency tracks blockchains to combat drug trafficking, and that he's not aware of any cases in which I.C.E. has used his company's tools for immigration enforcement.
To privacy advocates, the company's relationship with I.C.E. looks like a slippery slope.
"It's pretty trivial to use a blockchain analysis tool to see what transactions are sending money back to El Salvador," said Justin Ehrenhofer, an executive at the crypto privacy firm Cake Wallet. "That gives them a new angle to specifically target immigrants."
Mr. Ehrenhofer discovered virtual currencies when he was a teenager; at the time, he was using private browsers to look up L.G.B.T.Q. content on the internet, because he hadn't yet come out to his parents. His interest in the technology stemmed from its potential use as a privacy tool. But that viewpoint is increasingly old-fashioned. In recent years, the radical, idealistic traditions of the technology have largely given way to a more pragmatic approach, as Wall Street traders and Silicon Valley venture capitalists have flocked to the crypto world, in search of new ways to generate wealth online.
"The initial impetus for what we think of as digital cash and currency was privacy," said Finn Brunton, the author of a 2019 book about the history of crypto. "It's flipped all the way around."
Cake Wallet is one of a handful of companies still developing tools to make crypto transactions less traceable, a kind of counteroffensive against the blockchain-tracking industry. One of the firm's main products is a crypto wallet compatible with Monero, a so-called privacy coin that's harder to track than other cryptocurrencies. Every exchange of funds is recorded publicly, but the transaction information is obscured, making it much harder to see which wallet sent or received the money.
Investors aiming to evade blockchain-tracking software can also move funds through services known as mixers, which receive multiple strands of transactions and then combine them to obscure the source and destination of the money. In August, the Treasury Department barred Americans from using a popular mixer called Tornado Cash, saying it had been used to launder more than $ 7 billion in virtual currency, including hundreds of millions of dollars stolen by North Korean hackers.
The sanctions provoked an outcry from crypto investors. A group of Tornado Cash customers sued the Treasury Department to block the prohibition, arguing that mixers are essential to protecting privacy. One of the plaintiffs said he used the service to donate to the Ukrainian war effort, hoping to stay anonymous for fear of retaliation from Russia.
Chainalysis says little publicly about the techniques it uses to combat technologies like Monero or another crypto privacy service called Wasabi Wallet. But the company is trying to trace those transactions: Chainalysis has offered "Wasabi Demixing services" to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, a unit of the Treasury Department that oversees sanctions, according to documents obtained through a public records request.
The government's access to such tools has alarmed old-school crypto advocates. "Bitcoin could be the worst surveillance nightmare that we've ever imagined -- a world where everyone uses Bitcoin, but everybody's transaction history is totally public and everyone knows how much money everyone has," said Max Hillebrand, the chief executive of zkSNACKs, the company behind Wasabi Wallet. "That's not a world I'd be comfortable living in."
Cleaning up crypto
One morning in April, Mr. Gronager walked onstage at the Marriott Marquis hotel in Manhattan, welcoming a roomful of guests to Links 2023, an industry conference hosted by Chainalysis. He wore an orange Chainalysis T-shirt, matching his orange sneakers and orange watch strap. A line of glowing orange lights hung overhead.
"It's time to build things," Mr. Gronager proclaimed. "And we're actually doing that."
Blockchain analysis was once just a nerdy subculture of a nerdy industry, but recently it's gained a sheen of mainstream glamour. On Twitter, armchair sleuths with hundreds of thousands of followers use tracking software to expose crypto scams. Chainalysis has hosted the Links conference since 2019, but the most recent edition was the largest, with 900 attendees gathered at a venue that once hosted the N.F.L. Draft.
In November, the technology journalist Andy Greenberg published "Tracers in the Dark," a cinematic account of the rise of Chainalysis that details several of its highest-profile early investigations. Many of the law-enforcement figures profiled in the book have achieved celebrity status in the blockchain-tracking world and parlayed their knowledge of the technology's inner workings into high-paying corporate jobs.
Tigran Gambaryan, a former Internal Revenue Service agent who helped crack the child pornography case, attended the Links conference in his new capacity as a compliance executive for Binance, the embattled cryptocurrency exchange. "I feel like I've met a legend," one admirer said as he shook Mr. Gambaryan's hand.
Mr. Gambaryan and other government investigators used Chainalysis's technology to pursue terrorists and dark-net drug dealers. But the worst behavior in the crypto industry today is arguably even more difficult to combat: fraudulent offshore firms run by secretive executives, companies that engage in complex financial engineering to cover up holes in their accounts. Mr. Levin said Chainalysis is considering offering new product features that would help customers evaluate business risks in the crypto world.
"Everyone, after FTX, started to ask a lot more questions about counterparty risk," he said. "We're thinking about how do we present even better forms of information to them so that they can make informed decisions."
But Chainalysis is deeply enmeshed in the industry it's trying to clean up. A third of its revenue comes from the private sector; other blockchain companies use its software to gather market information. The firm's long-term prospects depend on crypto's continued growth. At the Links conference, Mr. Gronager clicked through a slide presentation full of graphs and statistics that he said showed the industry's resilience during the market downturn. "We believe all value will move on the blockchain," one slide read.
On the sidelines of the conference, some of the company's guests privately expressed apprehension. By trying to legitimize crypto in the eyes of the government, was Chainalysis simply providing cover for companies that violate securities law or engage in widespread fraud?
The stories of crime-busting blockchain tracers have become part of the crypto industry's public-relations playbook, said John Stark, a former Securities and Exchange Commission official and frequent crypto critic. "The idea that 'Hey, we're using these people to help us with our compliance,' it's just more subterfuge," he said. "Some kind of masquerade."
On the first day of Links, Mr. Levin appeared onstage for a friendly Q. and A. with Noah Perlman, a former federal prosecutor who was hired in January as Binance's new chief compliance officer. Two months after Mr. Perlman joined, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance, saying that gross compliance failures had allowed the exchange's customers to launder money.
But Binance claims it's turning over a new leaf. The company has hired former investigators like Mr. Gambaryan. And it has invested in blockchain tracking, buying more than 50 software accounts from Chainalysis.

Before a new breed of cryptocurrency detectives helped bring him down, Ryan Felton marketed his crypto scheme with a grandiose promise: He was creating “Netflix on the blockchain.”
He called the crypto-themed streaming service FLiK. For a small amount of the popular digital currency ether, customers could purchase a FLiK token, which would give them access to shows and movies broadcast on the new platform. Felton described the project as an “entertainment revolution”; crypto enthusiasts bought more than $2 million worth of FLiK coins.
But the streaming business never materialized. Instead, Felton bought a $1.5 million house, along with $32,000 in diamonds. He spent $180,000 more for a red Ferrari.
When cryptocurrencies hit the mainstream in the 2010s, the technology was widely viewed as a perfect vehicle for crime. A drug dealer or scam artist could transfer large quantities of money instantly, without relying on a bank to validate the transaction. To early advocates, crypto was appealing because it promised the secrecy and anonymity of cash, without the inconvenience of face-to-face exchanges.
That secrecy was an illusion. Crypto transactions are inscribed on a publicly viewable ledger called a blockchain. To the untrained observer, blockchain records are unintelligible — a jumble of meaningless letters and numbers. But a growing industry is dedicated to deciphering them.
At the center is the New York analytics startup Chainalysis, which was valued at $8.6 billion after a funding round last year. With tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts, Chainalysis has built a reputation as one of the crypto industry’s leading detectives — a team of blockchain analysts that helps the government track crypto transactions.
As federal agencies orchestrate an aggressive crackdown on crypto fraud, Chainalysis has come to occupy an increasingly important position in the industry. The company markets itself to the government and private companies as a force for good in a badly behaved sector — a firm whose business is solving crimes and cooperating with public officials.
After the FTX exchange imploded, its bankruptcy lawyers hired Chainalysis to disentangle the web of entities at the center of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire and track the $400 million in crypto that a hacker stole from FTX’s accounts. Chainalysis has also been conducting some light diplomacy: In April, it hosted a conference in New York City’s Manhattan borough to bring together government officials and the newly chastened crypto executives who are trying to win back their trust. Guests received socks stitched with the Chainalysis logo.
But that ambassadorial role has also put Chainalysis at odds with some of crypto’s most passionate advocates, who envisioned digital money as a private, anonymous financial network. That clash is a battle for crypto’s future, and it’s unfolding at a turbulent moment in the industry’s short history.
From the government’s perspective, Chainalysis is arguably the most trusted company in the industry — but only because it sells powerful tools aimed at penetrating the veil of secrecy that made crypto attractive in the first place.
The blockchain is “oftentimes the key to unlocking a case,” said Jonathan Levin, 32, one of the founders of Chainalysis. “It’s more traceable and more conclusive.”
In late 2020, Felton was indicted on charges that he had used investors’ funds to finance his extravagant lifestyle. He went on trial in Atlanta last summer. Testifying for the prosecution was Beth Bisbee, a Chainalysis investigator who once worked for the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2014, her analysis of blockchain records helped the DEA track down an internet drug dealer in Arizona.
That investigation was relatively low-tech: Bisbee pasted bitcoin transaction logs into a spreadsheet, which she searched for clues. These days, crypto fraud is more complicated, involving multiple types of currencies, each with its own blockchain. Chainalysis makes software that can do the time-consuming work automatically.
In the courtroom, Bisbee presented a colorful diagram mapping the movement of the millions of dollars’ worth of ether that investors spent on Felton’s tokens. The funds had been routed to a series of crypto wallets, digital repositories where people can store their holdings. Using a forensic technique called clustering, Bisbee showed that all those wallet addresses belonged to the same person: Felton. From those accounts, he had moved his investors’ ether to one exchange before transferring it to another. Then he’d converted the ether into cash.
“What was the source of the vast bulk of those funds before they were wired out?” one of the prosecutors asked Bisbee.
“The FLiK token sales,” she replied.
The prosecution presented its case over four days in July. On the last day, Felton pleaded guilty.

Full text: With the release of "Guy Ritchie's The Covenant," here's a look at the occasional phenomenon of directors branding movies with their own names.
He turned Will Smith into a cerulean genie for the 2019 live-action "Aladdin" and twice reimagined Sherlock Holmes as a swashbuckling rogue, to hefty box-office returns. As a filmmaker, though, Guy Ritchie has long been synonymous with sprawling ensemble pictures like "Snatch," "The Gentlemen" and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels": laddish, kinetic crime capers larded with movie stars, bloodied knuckles and inscrutable Cockney accents. (The latest of such outings, an antic international spy lark called "Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre" featuring Jason Statham, Hugh Grant and Aubrey Plaza, arrived to middling fanfare this past March.)
So why is "Guy Ritchie's The Covenant," a somber-looking Afghanistan war drama about an American sergeant (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim), the first of the director's 15 features to formally bear his name? The answer, according to its U.S. distributor, MGM, turns out to be fairly prosaic: Another company had already asserted rights to the title. ("Lee Daniels' The Butler," produced by the Weinstein Company, faced a similar challenge in court from Warner Brothers in 2013 and lost, precipitating a hasty last-minute change.)
But this kind of déjà vu is hardly new: Broad-strokes monikers like "Crash," "Heat" and "Rush" have all done double duty over the last few decades; "Twilight" is the name of both a poorly received 1998 neo-noir starring Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon and the 2008 teen-vampire juggernaut that launched four fanged, lugubrious sequels, as well as a cult 1990 mystery by the Hungarian filmmaker György Fehér. (Ritchie might have called his latest‌ ‌ "The Interpreter" instead, had that appellation not already been claimed by a 2005 Sydney Pollack political thriller starring Nicole Kidman; so back, alas, to the drawing board.)
If the back story of "The Covenant" wanders into the weeds of copyright law, "Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio," which won the Academy Award for best animated feature last month, makes an easier case for its qualifier: Without it, the movie could hardly be set apart from both the 1940 Disney classic still widely seen as definitive and an uncanny remake led by Tom Hanks -- it currently sits at a grim 29 percent approval rating on the critical-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes -- released less than two months before.
In a larger sense, though, the inclusion of del Toro's name also serves as shorthand and a promise, portending not only the age-old tale of a wooden boy made real but the particular vision of its maker -- a lush, prolific fantasist famed for the distinctive visual style and dazzling gothic grotesqueries of films like "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006) and the best picture-winning "The Shape of Water" (2017). That del Toro actually split directing duties for "his" "Pinocchio" with Mark Gustafson seems almost a footnote. Though Gustafson, an industry journeyman with a wide range of writing and animation credits ("Fantastic Mr. Fox," the original California Raisins), shared both the stage and the statuette with del Toro at this year's Oscars ceremony, it's the latter's renown, by most Hollywood metrics, that matters.
With "Pinocchio" and the 2022 Netflix horror-anthology series "Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities," the director joins a long line of auteurs, from Alfred Hitchcock to Tim Burton, whose presence not merely above the title but in it serves as a stylistic marker, even when it's not strictly their hand guiding the material. (The horror godhead Wes Craven habitually did the same; see "Wes Craven's New Nightmare.") Few, though, can claim to be the one-man industry that is Tyler Perry, who retains full ownership of the projects produced under his personal shingle at his stand-alone studio in Atlanta. The multihyphenate creator has famously put‌‌ his signature on several movie and television titles released under its umbrella -- including "Tyler Perry's A Madea Homecoming," the most recent iteration of the reliably raucous comedies that he also writes and stars in as a salty, well-cushioned matriarch of a certain age.
While Madea is Perry's wholesale creation, indubitably linked to the man who wears her wig onscreen, certain intellectual properties with roots that reach back centuries have tilted their brims instead toward a more literal (and literary) acknowledgment of the source. Think of the high-gloss 1990s productions "Bram Stoker's Dracula" (directed by Francis Ford Coppola) and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" (directed by Kenneth Branagh): It takes both the budget and the personal leverage of a prestige director, one presumes, to lay claim to the definitive versions of characters who have long been turned over to the public domain. Neither movie did much service to these iconic novels, but show business, as always, carries on: Coppola's four-decades-in-the-making passion project "Megalopolis," which wrapped shooting several weeks ago, was funded in part, he has publicly said, by his long-ago work on "Bram Stoker's Dracula." And Branagh, having recently mined his own Irish childhood for the dewy black-and-white drama "Belfast" (which won him an Oscar for original screenplay), will next direct and star as Hercule Poirot in his third Agatha Christie adaptation in six years, "A Haunting in Venice," due this September. Neither he nor Christie is officially billed in the title.

Happy 100th Birthday, 16-Millimeter Film: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The format was initially a boon to amateurs. Now, with moviemaking gone digital, it's the choice of auteurs like Darren Aronofsky and Kelly Reichardt.
One hundred years ago, the Eastman Kodak Company introduced a shiny new camera that promised to revolutionize moviemaking. The company had been selling filming devices for more than two decades by then, but this novel contraption -- the Ciné-Kodak camera, sold with the Kodascope projector -- offered a new thrill: the ability to make and screen movies at home, with no special expertise.
The technical marvel, however, wasn't just the camera but also the film inside. Until 1923, the film used most commonly in motion pictures was 35 millimeters wide. That year, Kodak produced a new format that was only 16 millimeters. The image wasn't as sharp when you blew it up on the big screen, but it allowed for smaller, cheaper and more portable cameras.
16 millimeter ushered in a new era of movies made outside the Hollywood system. Regular folks could now record their own lives, journalists and soldiers could film in the midst of war, and activists could shoot political documentaries in the street. Until digital video arrived in the late 1990s, 16-millimeter film was the mainstay of the amateur or independent filmmaker, requiring neither the investment nor the know-how of commercial cinema.
Last week, at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, which holds thousands of 16-millimeter reels in its collection, the film archivist Elena Rossi-Snook projected some shorts for a group of undergraduates from Marymount Manhattan College. As the projector whirred, a beam of light cut through the darkened room, painting the screen with scenes from the 1946 animated "Boundary Lines," a stirring movie by Philip Stapp about social integrity in the wake of World War II. That was followed by "The End," an antiwar stoner comedy directed by a teenager, Alfonso Sanchez, in 1968. The third film, "Black Faces" from 1970, was an ebullient, one-minute montage of portraits of Harlem residents.
These productions, precious documents of the lives and concerns of ordinary Americans, have endured, Rossi-Snook explained, because their makers had relatively cheap and convenient access to film, a medium that can last hundreds of years if stored properly.
Today, 16 millimeter is no longer optimal for the amateur filmmaker. Analog film is increasingly expensive, fewer and fewer labs can process it, and the format doesn't allow the nearly unlimited shooting and instant playback that video does. But even as it turns 100, 16 millimeter still has a unique look that neither 35-millimeter film nor video can rival.
When projected on the screen, analog film has a three-dimensional, pointillist texture called "grain," a product of its synthetic makeup. There is more grain in 16 millimeter than in 35 millimeter, resulting in a fuzzier, flickering picture. In the 20th century, that was a drawback for professional filmmakers seeking crisp, theatrical images. But today, as high-definition media saturate our lives, some directors choose 16 millimeter precisely for its rougher look. It reminds us that what we're watching is not the world as is, but filtered and transformed, with great creativity, through a chemical process.
The filmmaker Darren Aronofsky has shot several movies on 16-millimeter film, including "The Wrestler" (2008), "Black Swan" (2010) and "Mother!" (2017). But when he was making his debut feature, "Pi" (1998), 16 millimeter was a necessity, not a choice. The resolution of available digital cameras wasn't good enough for feature filmmaking at the time, and Aronofsky couldn't afford 35 millimeter. But he and his cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, soon realized that 16 millimeter -- especially the high-contrast stock they used called reversal film -- emphasized the hallucinatory style of "Pi," a black-and-white psychological thriller that delves into the obsessions of a paranoid number theorist.
"We decided to really lean into 16 millimeter," Aronofsky said in a phone interview. "I wanted the big grain and the contrast-y look. It's funny, because we just had the 25th anniversary of the film, and we blew it up for IMAX. And the IMAX people were nervous because of how grainy it was. They wanted to know if I wanted to clear out some of the grain with computer technology. And we said, absolutely not. We loved the look of it."
Several TV shows from the late '90s and early 2000s, including "The O.C." and "Sex and the City," used Super 16, a variation of 16 millimeter with a larger picture area that gave them a sense of real-time immediacy. The first 10 seasons of "The Walking Dead" were also largely shot on 16 millimeter to capture the grimy, crumbling feel of classic horror cinema.
The cinematographer John Inwood, who filmed 150 episodes of the comedy "Scrubs," recalled that 16-millimeter cameras, which are smaller and lighter than their 35-millimeter counterparts (and even many contemporary professional video cameras), were crucial in developing the series's frenetic mockumentary style.
"It was good for 'Scrubs' because we moved the cameras a lot, and we were sometimes in tight spaces," he told me. "We shot in an actual hospital, the former North Hollywood hospital, and we shot in every square inch of it, even down to the morgue."
As digital cameras have become sharper and more versatile, many filmmakers have turned to 16 millimeter to evoke the analog past and the blurry, precarious nature of memory. In an interview with Gold Derby, Newton Thomas Sigel, who filmed Spike Lee's "Da 5 Bloods" (2020), said the director had insisted to Netflix that they use 16-millimeter reversal film for the sequences set amid the Vietnam War, despite the costs and logistical challenges. The film had to be shipped from Vietnam to an American lab for processing, and by the time the crew members could see what they had shot, Chadwick Boseman's acting schedule had already ended. But Lee was adamant that the scenes look authentic, like archival newsreels filmed in the field in the 1970s.
The veteran cinematographer Ed Lachman used Super 16 on two of his collaborations with the director Todd Haynes, both of them period dramas: the mini-series "Mildred Pierce" (2011), and "Carol" (2015), which garnered him an Academy Award nomination.
On both projects, the format was chosen to mimic photographic images from the 1940s and '50s, and the grittiness of postwar America. But Lachman realized that the grain also brought "tension to the surface of the image," paralleling the repressive qualities of the characters in both "Mildred Pierce" and "Carol."
For Lachman, the appeal of 16 millimeter transcends nostalgia. It comes down to cinema's status as an art, meant to stylize rather than simply reproduce reality. He likened film to painting, and grain to brushstrokes. "The grain changes in each frame with exposure," he said. "It's like breathing, almost like an anthropomorphic quality."
The filmmaker Kelly Reichardt recalled that when she started shooting her 2016 feature, "Certain Women," she didn't have the budget for 16 millimeter. But when she and her cameraman, Christopher Blauvelt, did test shoots in Montana, where the film is set, Reichardt was horrified at how "flat" the snow looked on video.
"With film stocks, things weren't so real looking," Reichardt said. "A lot of it is grain, and 16 has more grain than 35. So when you blow it up, you don't get the hard lines that you get in HD, which is what you see in sports."
A grant ultimately allowed Reichardt to shoot "Certain Women" on 16 millimeter. It made the production more laborious, but the results -- soft, textured images of wide roads, snowy mountains and grassy plains, all shimmering with light, dust and shadow -- made it worth it.
"I guess it's about beauty, in a way," Reichardt said. "I remember on '30 Rock' they did a little thing where Lemon walks in front of the HD camera, and it's like, she's a skeleton hag. You know? You see every single thing. It's very unforgiving. For nature, too."

In ‘The Diplomat,’ Keri Russell Shows Her Good Side

NEW YORK — Actress Keri Russell paused in a corner of Brooklyn Bridge Park to admire a starling. It was spring, on this recent Thursday, but the weather had other ideas, and Russell, in subdued plumage, braved the wind in chunky boots and a black puffer jacket. Her hair was tousled. Liner ringed each eye, possibly a souvenir from the previous night’s too many margaritas with friends. She didn’t look much like a woman who devoted years of her life to undermining the American democratic project. Or like a woman now charged with safeguarding it.
But Russell has been both of those women (and a lot of other women besides). At this point in her career, she is probably best known for her six seasons on the FX drama “The Americans” as Elizabeth Jennings, a Soviet sleeper agent with an ambitious collection of ruses and wigs who earned Russell three Emmy nominations. Now Russell has taken on an opposing role: In the “The Diplomat,” a Netflix series debuting on Thursday, she stars as Kate Wyler, a savvy U.S. civil servant tasked with upholding America’s reputation abroad.
A veteran ambassador, Kate is about to take a post in Kabul, Afghanistan, when an international incident shunts her and her husband, Hal (Rufus Sewell), to London. An English manor house is not a war zone, but Kate behaves otherwise. Armored in punishing heels and sleek sheath dresses, she treats even polite conversation as battlefield maneuvers. But in a departure from “The Americans,” Kate’s work is almost entirely aboveboard. She wears no wigs.
As some Canada geese waddled nearby, Russell considered the disparities between these two roles. “It was fun being a baddie, doing sneaky stuff,” she said. But “The Diplomat” also has its pleasures, she insisted. “It’s awesome to be smart and capable and dress people down and be so steady about it,” she said.
If Elizabeth is a baddie, does that make Kate a goody? Russell gave a cagey smile. “We’ll see,” she said.
Russell began her career as a teenage dancer in “The Mickey Mouse Club” and then starred in “Felicity” as a capricious college student and the patron saint of dithery girls everywhere. She did not necessarily expect to spend her midcareer playing hypercompetent women while also showing the uncertainty that undergirds that competence. In addition to playing Elizabeth and Kate, she has also recently appeared as an indomitable mother in the horror comedy “Cocaine Bear” and as a cool, if not especially effective, assassin in “Extrapolations.”
Felicity would not have excelled at either espionage or high-stakes diplomacy. “Felicity would write a poem about it,” Russell said. But that was 20 years ago. Russell, who in person is outspoken, unfussy, charmingly profane and so candid that she encourages similar candor in others and now absolutely has kompromat on me, has grown up. She has since become a mother. She has two children with her former husband, Shane Deary, and a young son with her partner Matthew Rhys, her co-star on “The Americans.”
“Moms are like that!” she said of these recent capable characters. “You’re going to make it happen. A mom can do 37 things in one day!”
Russell comes to this park, near the home that she shares with Rhys and her children, on the rare occasions when she has an early morning to herself. Sometimes, before anyone else is awake, she’ll ride her bike through the park’s loops. “It’s a beautiful, happening place,” she said, pointing out the roller rink, the basketball courts, a meadow, the indelible view of Manhattan across the East River.
Over the last year or so, those mornings have been rarer. It was during the Christmas holiday of 2021, when Russell had volunteered to cook dinner for the children’s three sets of grandparents, that she received the scripts for “The Diplomat.” With Rhys already away for part of the year filming the gloomy HBO revival of “Perry Mason” — “I was already punishing him with guilt for not being home,” she said — she wasn’t looking for another starring role.
Still, something in Kate’s ambition and savvy, as well as the humor of her marital tussles with Hal, called to her. She agreed to a video call with the show’s creator, Debora Cahn, a veteran of “Homeland” and “The West Wing.”
Cahn had wanted Russell for the role, trusting that Kate would benefit from Russell’s beauty, grace and ability to convey emotions even in characters who control and repress their feelings. But Kate was a more neurotic proposition than past Russell characters — gorgeous enough to be the subject of a Vogue spread in the show but also sweaty, squirrelly, with a lot of angst behind the poise.
“There’s a part of Kate that is itchy and twitchy and always uncomfortable in her own skin,” Cahn said in a recent phone interview.
Russell was a woman of far more poise, Cahn assumed, but she knew that Russell was also a skilled actor. She could perform that discomfort. And yet, as she watched Russell squirm through the video call, she discovered that discomfort was part of the Russell package, too.
“I get really nervous,” Russell confirmed in the park. “I do really sweat a lot.” (She didn’t seem to be sweating here, though it was quite cold.)
This contradiction — glamour in the front, social anxiety in the back — helped Cahn explore the thesis of “The Diplomat,” which is that everybody sweats, even (or especially) the bodies in power.
“In Buckingham Palace, in the Great Hall of the People, everybody in there is still a leaky human,” Cahn said.
Kate, on the show, puts it more tartly. “You show people the nice parts because, believe me, that’s all that anyone wants to see,” she says.
The effort that Kate makes to maintain a flawless veneer resonated with Russell, though largely because she has never had much patience with or talent for the public-facing aspects of her profession — the interviews, the award shows, the times when she has to perform a more idealized version of herself. She used to beat herself up for this unease, but she has since accepted it.
“I’m like, that’s who I am,” she said.
And yet, sets are places where she has always felt at home. “The Diplomat” filmed last summer, mostly in London and mostly on location. Sewell had never met Russell, his work wife, until they were both in the hair and makeup trailer, but he was struck by her openness and ease.
“She immediately was very friendly and personable and easy,” he said. “I automatically thought it was going to be relatively straightforward working with her, because she was a lot of fun.”
Fun is not necessarily a word that anyone would apply to Kate or that Kate would apply to herself. However sweaty Russell feels herself to be, she moves through the world, or at least through the park, with less strain and tension. (And she is fun. At one point, she pulled out her phone and showed a picture of herself looking unhinged in an ash-blond wig, an outtake from “The Americans.” She sends the picture to her friends when it’s time to party. “We don’t let her have chardonnay anymore,” she said of the image.)
While Kate is a creature of ambition, Russell has always held her work more lightly, even as she pushes herself to give vivid, committed performances.
“When I’m there, I work hard,” she said. “I want to be good.” But she drew a distinction between herself and Rhys, even though they take on many of the same projects. (He is in “Extrapolations” and “Cocaine Bear,” too.)
“He likes to be busy,” she said. “I like to never be busy. I like to like drift away and roam the park.”
She was near the river now. The sun turned the gray water gold. Ducks dabbled. Unlike Kate, no one needed her to save the world today or to sweat through her clothes while neutralizing some new crisis. Hypercompetence could wait. She needed only to find her way back through the park and text Rhys to see if he could meet her at an Italian restaurant close by. Among the 37 things, there was just time for a beer before school pickup.

Full text: The writers have not gone on strike in 15 years, and the vote gives their unions the right to call for a walkout when their contract expires on May 1.
Hollywood is getting ever closer to a shutdown.
The unions representing thousands of television and movie writers said on Monday that they had overwhelming support for a strike, giving union leaders the right to call for a walkout when the writers' contract with the major Hollywood studios expires on May 1.
The unions, which are affiliated East and West Coast branches of the Writers Guild of America, said more than 9,000 writers had approved a strike authorization, with 98 percent of the vote.
W.G.A. leaders have said this is an "existential" moment for writers, contending that compensation has stagnated over the last decade despite the explosion of television series in the streaming era. In an email last week to writers, the lead negotiators said that "the survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation."
With two weeks to go before the contract expires, there has been little sign of progress in the talks. In the email, the negotiating committee said the studios "have failed to offer meaningful responses on the core economic issues" and offered only small concessions in a few areas.
"In short, the studios have shown no sign that they intend to address the problems our members are determined to fix in this negotiation," the email said.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood production companies, said in a statement that a strike authorization "should come as no surprise to anyone."
"A strike authorization vote has always been part of the W.G.A.'s plan, announced before the parties even exchanged proposals," the statement said. "Our goal is, and continues to be, to reach a fair and reasonable agreement." It added, "An agreement is only possible if the guild is committed to turning its focus to serious bargaining by engaging in full discussions of the issues with the companies and searching for reasonable compromises."
In recent weeks, Hollywood executives have begun preparing for a strike, both by stockpiling scripts and by getting ready to produce a torrent of reality series, which do not need script writers. David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns the Warner Bros. film and TV studios as well as HBO, said at a news media event last week that he was hopeful a deal would be reached. He added that "a strike will be a challenge for the whole industry."
Still, he said, the company was fully prepared if there was a walkout.
"We're assuming the worst from a business perspective," he said. "We've got ourselves ready. We've had a lot of content that's been produced."
A strike authorization does not guarantee writers will take to the picket lines in two weeks. In 2017, a last-minute deal was struck with the studios not long after 96 percent of the writers voted to authorize a strike. The last time the writers went on strike was in 2007. That stoppage dragged for 100 days, into early 2008, and cost the Los Angeles economy an estimated $ 2.1 billion.
If a strike begins in early May, late-night shows like "Saturday Night Live" and talk shows hosted by Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers will go dark immediately. It would take a strike of several months before viewers began to notice an effect on scripted television series and movies.
The streaming era has resulted in a significant rise in the number of scripted television series that are produced, but writers say working conditions have not kept pace.
"Writers are working more weeks for less money," said Eric Haywood, a veteran writer and producer, and a member of the W.G.A. negotiating committee. "And in some cases, veteran writers are working for the same money or, in some cases, less money than they made just a few years ago."
The timing of the talks has an added complexity given the current financial challenges for all media and entertainment companies.
Over the last year, share prices for those companies have nose-dived after Wall Street began questioning why many streaming services were losing billions of dollars a year. The studios are quickly trying to make those streaming services profitable, after years of focusing primarily on growth. The shift is coming at a cost.
Disney is in the midst of 7,000 job cuts. Warner Bros. Discovery, confronting a debt load of about $ 50 billion, shelved projects and laid off thousands of workers last year. Other media companies are taking similar cost-cutting measures.
The writers do not appear to be sympathetic.
"The current status quo is unsustainable," Mr. Haywood said.
The writers have taken particular aim at so-called minirooms. There is no one definition of a miniroom, but they have proliferated in the streaming era.
In one example, the studios will convene a miniroom before a show has been picked up by a studio and scheduled to air. A small group of writers will develop a series and write several scripts over two or three months.
But because the studios have not ordered the series, they will use that as justification to pay writers less than if they were in a formal writers' room, union leaders said. And given the relatively short duration of the position, those writers are then left scrambling to find another job if the show is not picked up.
One union leader likened minirooms to "labor camps" during the negotiations, according to two people familiar with the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
A W.G.A. spokesman said the reference was not literal and had come during a presentation lasting an hour and a half.
"Development work has always been paid at a premium because you're coming up with the idea," Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator for the W.G.A., said in an interview. "If you're going to have these rooms before you pick up a show or a season, you should pay writers a premium."
The writers have also said residuals -- which Ms. Stutzman called "the profit participation of the middle-class writer" -- have been affected in the streaming era. Before streaming, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed, whether that was for syndication, an international deal or DVD sales.
But in the streaming era, as global services like Netflix and Amazon have been reluctant to license their series, those distribution arms have been cut off and replaced with a fixed residual, Ms. Stutzman said.
"If an overwhelming majority of the content writers create is for the streaming platforms where they are completely cut out of global growth and success, that is a very big problem," she said.

LOS ANGELES — Hollywood is getting ever closer to a shutdown.
The unions representing thousands of television and movie writers said Monday that they had overwhelming support for a strike, giving union leaders the right to call for a walkout when the writers’ contract with the major Hollywood studios expires May 1.
The unions, which are affiliated East and West coast branches of the Writers Guild of America, said more than 9,000 writers had approved a strike authorization, with 98% of the vote.

What Won't People Buy In a Bid For the Past: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Just about everyone has somewhere special they went when young, a place that glows in memory. For some it may be a library or game arcade, for others a baseball field or bookstore. For Jay Carlson, growing up in western Massachusetts in the early 1990s, the center of the universe was the video rental store.
This was before streaming, before Netflix, before DVDs. The videocassette player was the summit of consumer technology. At the rental shop, 12-year-old Jay would bump into friends and neighbors, hear about something that couldn't be missed, talk up his own favorites. It was like social media before social media was invented.
He grew up, got married, had children, went to work in the finance department of a retailer. Technology moved on, but his heart did not. One day, he saw in his local comics store a tape of "Ghostbusters," the first movie his parents let him pick out himself. It was $ 7, still sealed from the factory.
"I said to my wife, 'I think I might start collecting tapes,"' Mr. Carlson, 43, said. "I was taking a piece of my childhood back."
Many others are, too. The stock market, real estate and cryptocurrencies did poorly in 2022, but the global luxury goods market grew 20 percent. People may have had less, but they spent more on fine arts and collectibles that serve no function except to provide pleasure.
The culture is bursting with new material -- every day, thousands of new books are published and 100,000 new songs are released on Spotify -- but the old stuff offers a sweeter emotional payoff for many. It could be tapes or posters or pictures or comics or coins or sports cards or memorabilia. It might be from their childhood or the childhood they never had, or it might merely express a longing to be anywhere but 2023.
The common element is this: People like to own a thing from a thing they love. For Mr. Carlson and millions like him, the nostalgia factory is working overtime.
When Mr. Carlson first began to look for sealed VHS cassettes, they were considered so much plastic trash. "Back to the Future," "The Goonies," "Blade Runner," were about $ 20 each on eBay. He put them on a shelf, little windows into his past, and started an Instagram account called Rare and Sealed.
Then tapes began to get scarcer and much more expensive. People trapped at home had lots of money to spend during the pandemic. But it was more than that.
Objects with a bit of history have an obvious attraction in a high-tech world. The current cultural tumult, with its boom in fake images, endless arguments over everything and now the debut of imperious A.I. chatbots, increases the appeal of things that can't be plugged in.
At the same time, advances in technology mean it is ever easier to buy expensive things online. Bids at auctions routinely reach tens, even hundreds, of thousands of dollars.
One thing people are eagerly seeking with the new technology is old technology. Cormac McCarthy's typewriter, which he used to write a shelf of important novels, went for a quarter-million dollars. An Apple 1 computer fetched nearly twice that. A first-generation iPhone, still sealed in its box, sold for $ 21,000 in December and triple that in February.
Blend these factors -- a desire for escape from our virtual lives; bidding as fast as pushing a button; and the promotion of new collecting fields like outdated technology devices -- and you have Heritage Auctions in Dallas.
Heritage is a whirlwind of activity, of passion, of hype, constantly trying new ways of enticing people to own something beautiful and useless. Ninety-one million Americans, according to U.S. Census Bureau surveys, are having trouble paying household bills. Everyone else is a potential bidder.
"There was a point in time when art and collectibles were dominated by old white men," said Josh Benesh, Heritage's chief strategy officer. "I think that has been democratized. And the categories of material for sale have been democratized a lot."
Twenty years ago, Heritage had four categories: coins, comics, movie posters and sports. Now it has more than 50, which generated revenue of $ 1.4 billion last year. Everything, at least in theory, is collectible.
"We don't question the value or legitimacy of a particular subject matter relative to outmoded norms," Mr. Benesh said. "We're not here to tell you what's worthwhile. The marketplace will tell you. The bidders" -- Heritage has 1.6 million -- "will tell you."
VHS tapes were apparently worthwhile. The selection of an expert to run the sales was easy: Mr. Carlson. His first auction, in June 2022, brought in more than a half-million dollars.
The publicity around the sale brought Mr. Carlson, whose email address is on the Heritage website, many offers of tapes. One man said he had put together a time capsule for his son, who was born on Christmas Day 1982. "Rocky III" had just come out, so the father included a brand-new copy. He threw in "Rocky I" and "Rocky II" as well. They'd cost $ 60 each.
The three tapes, all with a factory seal, fetched $ 53,750 in a February auction.
Since cassettes were designed to be played, only a few unopened ones exist 40 years later. But since they were never considered valuable, they might be found anywhere for a pittance.
"A man told us he found a sealed first release of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' at Goodwill," Mr. Carlson said. "He paid a quarter. That will probably go for $ 20,000."
Every potential bidder must decide if this is the 2023 equivalent of Beanie Babies, which flew high and then crashed. Mr. Carlson would not be working at Heritage if he didn't believe.
"These tapes are historical artifacts that have this ability to sweep you back in time to a place that all at once feels miles away and yet somehow like home," he said. "I used to think it was just me, but I talk to more and more people getting into this because of that pull."
The pull of nostalgia is powerful indeed. But the pull of quick cash can be more powerful still. There were 235 lots in February's tape auction, and they all sold.
For those who missed out, dozens of the lots are now highlighted on Heritage's website to suggest the owner might be willing to flip his newly acquired copy of "Caddyshack" for a 50 percent premium.
At Heritage, the bidding never really ends.
Wanted Dead or Alive
The Heritage offices look like a cross between an Amazon warehouse and a very wide-ranging museum, with a dash of "Hoarders" thrown in.
In mid-2020, the privately held company moved to a 160,000-square-foot building by Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, doubling the size of its former headquarters. Hundreds of specialists, most of them collectors themselves, prepare hundreds of thousands of items for bids here -- researching, photographing, writing catalog copy.
There are boxes of Teenage Mutant Turtles Killer Bee toys. A CBS television camera that filmed the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald. A poster from the McKinley campaign in 1896. Lots of Pokémon. Fake newspapers from the HBO series "Watchmen." Lots and lots of comic books. A videocassette of the horror flick "Death Spa." Sneakers. Trading cards.
Stuff overwhelms desks; objects are piled to the ceilings in storage rooms; racks are full of items that have been bought and must be shipped.
The spiritual roots of Heritage, which calls itself "America's auction house," go back to the most primitive type of collector, the souvenir hunter. Anything not nailed down in America, along with quite a bit that is, becomes prey. Traveling through Missouri in 1882, Oscar Wilde noticed a crowd pulling down a little yellow house.
"It is the house of the great train-robber and murderer, Jesse James, who was shot by his pal last week, and the people are relic hunters," the playwright reported. "They sold his dustbin and foot-scraper yesterday at public auction, his door-knocker is to be offered for sale this afternoon, the reserve price being about the income of an English bishop."
Wilde added that Americans "are great hero-worshippers, and always take their heroes from the criminal classes." That's as true as ever. A few months ago, Heritage sold the outlaw's pocket revolver for $ 62,500.
The problem is, older historical items that were previously unknown are becoming rare. Every barn, basement and attic has been ransacked for treasures. New items related to Washington or Lincoln, for instance, are nearly impossible to find.
"All the varieties of Lincoln inaugural buttons seem to be known," said Curtis Lindner, Heritage's director of Americana. "There has not been a new photo of Lincoln in many years. We get a lot of people saying, 'I have a new image.' Unfortunately, not everyone who has a beard is Abraham Lincoln."
So the pressure is on to develop new material. For instance, Vegas casino chips. "People have emotional ties to Vegas," said Ray Farina, who moved over from Americana to develop this niche. "Maybe they saw Elvis there back in the day."
A 1953 chip from the fabled Sands casino sold for $ 12,000 at Heritage in December. Now people with chips are contacting Heritage. A guy says his father worked for the casinos taking the decommissioned chips out to the desert to bury them in concrete. Apparently, he kept some.
"Word gets out," Mr. Farina said. "We have tremendous marketing ability here."
The pace of Heritage's auctions is relentless -- there were 1,034 in 2022, almost three a day, with a total of 412,270 lots -- and so are the Heritage emails promoting them.
Even so, revenue barely inched up in 2022 after growing 60 percent in 2021. The number of registered bidders rose, but only by a small fraction. There may be a limit to what marketing can do.
Looking for a Sure Thing
Sitting in his office on a rainy Monday morning, Chris Ivy, the director of sports auctions at Heritage, is a bit distracted. That's because he is talking about auctions while simultaneously bidding for Heritage on a Michael Jordan jersey being auctioned by a competitor.
Last summer, Heritage sold a Mickey Mantle rookie card for $ 12.6 million, which it billed as the most valuable sports collectible ever sold at auction. The clothing actually worn by players seems to Mr. Ivy undervalued by comparison.
He suspects this Jordan jersey, which is being sold as nothing special, was worn in a game. "It has a downside of maybe $ 5,000 and an upside of $ 100,000. I'll take that every day of the week," he says. "We use our expertise here to help generate income."
Mr. Ivy wins the jersey for about $ 20,000. To try to authenticate it, he will use a photo-matching service, which will scour the internet for proof that it is what he thinks it is. When a historical object is validated with contemporary images, bidders are encouraged.
A recent Heritage auction featured a 1948 Joe DiMaggio jersey. What made it special was the black armband attached to the left sleeve, a tribute to Babe Ruth after his death on Aug. 16 of that year. The Yankees' two greatest stars were thus linked for a few weeks.
The jersey was being sold by a collector, and there was no direct connection to DiMaggio. So Heritage sent photographs of it to Resolution Photomatching in Seattle.
Resolution found a contemporary picture that showed DiMaggio apparently wearing the shirt, although without the mourning band. The tiny imperfections in the flannel were the same. The jersey sold for $ 564,000.
Data can mislead as well as illuminate. Two years ago, an Australian gamer named Karl Jobst released a popular video that made allegations of fraud against Heritage. The company responded that it "has always acted with the utmost integrity and has never falsely inflated the collector video-game marketplace or any other."
At the heart of the accusations is the question of grading. In the 1980s, ratings companies began offering numerical scores for coins at auction. In theory, that meant bidders knew exactly what they were getting without having to examine each lot personally.
Ratings accelerated the development of online auctions, with the practice spreading to sports cards, comic books and, more recently, game cartridges and videotapes. After grading, items are inserted into a hard plastic case to prevent wear. Just like a photo-match, a high grade reassures potential bidders that the object is, indeed, something special.
Then came the Super Mario Bros. game cartridge auctions.
Super Mario is a Nintendo game introduced in the mid-1980s that became a global phenomenon and, this month, a new Hollywood movie. In 2017, an unrated copy of the original game brought in $ 30,000 on eBay, prompting shock and disbelief. Two years later, a cartridge graded 9.4 sold for $ 100,000 to a group that included Jim Halperin, a founder of Heritage. The purchase was used by Heritage to promote its new auction of graded games.
In the summer of 2021, Heritage auctioned a Super Mario cartridge for $ 1.56 million, a tenfold increase in two years and the first game to be sold at auction for more than $ 1 million. It had a grade of 9.8 and was rated A++. The sale made news. In the same auction, a Super Mario was graded at 8.5 and rated A+. It sold for only $ 31,000.
Valarie Spiegel, who oversees video games at Heritage, explained the $ 1.5 million difference: "9.8 is a trophy-level grade," whereas "8.5 is not." Keep in mind this is not about the game itself but, in essence, the tightness of the plastic seal.
Grading, Mr. Jobst points out, is "very subjective by nature." When dealers and collectors get a grade that they think is too low, they simply crack open the plastic case and send the item back to the grading company or a competitor. This is known as "the crack-out game."
Forbes magazine accused Mr. Halperin of doing this with coins in 2004, creating a sort of grade inflation that pushed up prices for unwary bidders. In a lengthy rebuttal that is still on the Heritage website, Mr. Halperin said he publicly encouraged crack-outs by anyone who got a grade they thought too low.
"We sell an item as if it were our own," Mr. Ivy said. "Our question always is, How can we maximize this? The more we get for our consignors, the more money we make."
The Nostalgia Vault
The thrill of a collection is that it is real -- you can take it off the shelf. This is also, of course, the problem with collecting. Collections can easily overwhelm a house, a life.
Several online auction companies have recently announced programs to take care of collections for their owners. Collecting, which gained so much momentum as a response to the virtual, is moving away from its physical reality.
A program being tested at eBay uses a vault in Delaware to store sports cards. Collectors cannot visit their treasures, but eBay will take a photograph of the card and send it to the owner, kind of like seeing your child at summer camp. Beckett, a sports collectible company, has opened a 100,000-square-foot vault in Plano, Texas.
Mr. Carlson, the videocassette expert, is not so sure he would want to use a vault. He likes seeing his tapes too much. In any case, his collection is not growing much these days. He's wrapped up in his job at Heritage. And then there's the problem of money, or lack of it.
"Some of the tapes I like go beyond my budget," he said.

Full text: Amorepacific partners with the Metropolitan Museum of Art to expand the reach of Sulwhasoo, their luxury Korean beauty brand.
"I am ginseng," boomed the voice of Tilda Swinton to partygoers in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Temple of Dendur, where Sulwhasoo, the Korean beauty brand, was throwing a lavish dinner to celebrate its new partnership with the 152-year-old institution. A promotional video featuring Ms. Swinton played overhead, depicting a ginseng root spinning in circles.
The British actress had been named Sulwhasoo's global ambassador, but couldn't attend because she was filming. Still, the evening's guest list was a who's who of Korean excellence, including the global pop star Rosé, of K-pop group Blackpink, the Academy Award-winning actress Yuh-Jung Youn, writer Cathy Park Hong and the Michelin-starred chef Junghyun Park, who had prepared the ginseng-inspired menu. The rapper Anderson .Paak was the D.J. for the after-party.
"Sulwhasoo is my mom's favorite brand," said Ashley Park, 31, a star of "Emily in Paris" on Netflix. "It's a smell I associate with her: ginseng. It's like, 'That's mom."'
Ginseng, an ingredient often used in traditional Asian medicine with a distinctly earthy smell, is a key ingredient used by Sulwhasoo in many of their more popular products.
"When it comes to Sulwhasoo and the ingredients that we use -- it's mostly edible ingredients," said Kyung-Bae Suh, 60, the chairman and CEO of Amorepacific, which was founded by Mr. Suh's grandmother, Dok-Jeong Yun, in 1932 (Amorepacific is the parent company of Sulwhasoo). "They can be used in food, medicine. The philosophy behind it is that inner health and inner beauty is very important. If your inside is beautiful and healthy, it's going to manifest on your surface, on your face, on your skin."
This thinking embodies, in many ways, the larger ethos behind Korean beauty, or K-beauty as it is more commonly called, which has become increasingly popular in America in the last two decades. According to data from Kotra, Korea's trade promotion agency, in 2018 Korea's cosmetics exports were estimated at around $ 5.95 billion, up 22 percent from the year before. Often exoticized for its unfamiliar ingredients, such as snail mucin and donkey's milk, K-beauty espouses the idea that cosmetics need not be about correcting your imperfections, but rather about cultivating what comes from within.
Over 90 percent of Sulwhasoo's sales still come from Asia, but the brand is now looking to expand its presence in the United States and Europe, where it is less known. Mr. Suh recognizes this as Sulwhasoo's "big push," with celebrities such as Rosé and Ms. Swinton, and a subtle redesign of the brand's packaging (its signature amber hue now has an ombré fade). Both signal Sulwhasoo's desire to capture a younger and more Western customer base. It's a new page for a relatively dignified brand, which in its 25-year history has avoided any form of celebrity endorsement until 2018.
Still, there are reasons to be skeptical of the benefits touted in luxury skin care (a bottle of Sulwhasoo's best-selling Ginseng Renewing Serum costs $ 210). Despite South Korea's overwhelming number of beauty products and its industry's unparalleled innovation, South Korea is still often referred to as the plastic surgery capital of the world. According to a 2019 report from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Korea had the highest rate of plastic surgery per capita in the world, with 13.5 cosmetic procedures performed per 1,000 individuals.
"If there is a 'secret' to Korean beauty, it would be the medical advancements they've made in low impact or less-invasive surgery and injectables," said Euny Hong, journalist and author of "The Birth of Korean Cool: How One Nation Is Conquering the World Through Pop Culture."‌ "Snow, flower, beauty"
The history of Amorepacific dates back to the 1930s, during the Japanese occupation of Korea, when Ms. Yun sold camellia hair oil in Kaesong, a city now part of North Korea, to help support her family. Women at the time traditionally wore their hair parted down the middle, braided and coiled into a bun with a hair pin; the oil kept the hair in place and retained its luster. Pure camellia oil -- the hard-earned result of manually pressing hand-peeled and ground camellia seeds -- was valued for being scentless and for keeping hair shiny for a longer period of time.
As the mother of six children, Ms. Yun juggled parenting with the responsibilities of her nascent business, often bringing her infants on the road to breastfeed while pedaling her wares. By the end of the 1930s, business was robust enough for her to set up her own storefront, called Changseong Shop.
In 1945 World War II would intervene. Ms. Yun's second son, Sung-whan Suh -- who had become a valuable employee, entrusted with bicycling to Seoul to buy ingredients -- was drafted into the Japanese army. A year later, he returned and took over the family business, renaming the company Taepyeongyang ("Pacific Ocean" in Korean). It was an allusion to his ambitions to grow the company beyond Korea's own shores.
The next decade proved to be challenging, marked by the divisive violence of the Korean War. Sung-Whan Suh relocated his own family to Seoul, launching a popular face cream and hair pomade. Many Koreans, however, preferred beauty brands from the West and Japan when they could afford them. Ambitious and with an eye toward longevity, Sung-Whan Suh created a research and development lab in 1954 in hopes of competing and harnessing the power of ingredients found in Korea, including ginseng. Today, Amorepacific's research and development lab employs over 500 people.
In 1987, the company launched Sulwha, an herb-based cosmetic. It wasn't until 1997 that the brand landed on the name Sulwhasoo.
"'Sul' means snow, 'wha' means flower, 'soo' means beauty. Snow, flower, beauty," explained Ga-Yoon Jung, senior vice president of marketing at Amorepacific. "But it doesn't mean the literal flower and snow. The snow flower is the first flower that blooms right after winter."
That same year, Sung-Whan Suh's second son Kyung-Bae Suh took over as CEO of Amorepacific. By then, South Korea's economy was booming, and investing its money in film, television and pop music in what would become known as "the Korean Wave" or "Hallyu."
Today, Mr. Suh is one of South Korea's wealthiest citizens. In 2018, he debuted Amorepacific's new headquarters, a stunning 22-story building in Seoul designed by the architect David Chipperfield, who is being awarded the Pritzker Prize later this year. He is also an avid collector of contemporary and Korean art.
Neither the museum nor Mr. Suh would disclose the terms of their sponsorship, but the association came about after Max Hollein, the Met's director, flew to South Korea last summer. Sulwhasoo plans to underwrite two additional community-oriented programs with the Met. "They wanted to be involved where they could offer support for our programming -- and it wasn't a one-off event or exhibition," Mr. Hollein said.
For Mr. Suh, who feels the Met's sense of heritage aligns with that of his family's company, the choice to partner with the museum may also be guided by his own experience: In 1983, it was the first museum he ever visited outside of Korea.
Because of its history, the popularity of Sulwhasoo -- a prominent brand in Amorepacific's portfolio -- also carries a kind of nostalgia for Korea's difficult past. "I think that's been comforting for many Korean people, given how quickly the economy grew," said Joyce Kong, a former Korean beauty consultant. Both represent the changes South Korea has experienced in the last century. "To them, Sulwhasoo is still tethered to this old world."

Springsteen, Seinfeld and What This Country's Been Missing: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Is there any sentiment more startling at this current gloomy moment than optimism? Or, at a time when half the country seems to be warring simultaneously with the other half and itself, unity? Perhaps even more disconcerting, that long dormant sensation, hope?
Most live events, whether a sports game or a concert, tend to generate a sense of communion. But last weekend at two performances with ostensibly little in common -- Jerry Seinfeld's 100th appearance at the Beacon Theater on Saturday night and Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at the UBS Arena on Long Island on Sunday -- the collective emotional response felt almost preternaturally heightened, and unexpectedly similar.
It wasn't just that the very concept of synchronicity itself is so markedly out of sync with our divisive era. Nor did the feeling of togetherness seem to stem from the shared audience demographics -- overwhelmingly white, skewed male and on the whole ... not young. Something more than mere nostalgia for their earlier selves seemed to be at play. It was as if the two performances reconnected audiences with an earlier culture, one our current fragmented cacophony of infinite entertainment can no longer deliver.
Bruce Springsteen is 73 and Jerry Seinfeld 68. Both reached the heights of their popularity in a pre-internet, pre-iPhone, pre-streaming era. Back then, a performance was something you witnessed as it happened rather than on demand. As Chuck Klosterman noted in his 2022 book, "The Nineties," TV at that time was built on the idea that you could watch only at a particular moment in time. "Seinfeld" offered an especially present-tense experience, filmed in front of a studio audience: "For much of a decade, 'Seinfeld' was the most popular, most transformative, live-action show on television," Klosterman writes.
Entertainment was almost necessarily a shared, rather than purely personal, experience, more universal and, in some ways, more accessible. You could buy a concert ticket without a total Ticketmaster-induced meltdown. Springsteen, who with his E Street Band, was once voted by Rolling Stone readers the best live act of all time, owes much of his popularity to touring and live albums. And up until this 2023 tour, Springsteen notably made an effort to keep tickets at a reasonable price.
Both Springsteen and Seinfeld experienced their apogee at a very different political moment in this country. The 1980s and '90s certainly had their share of problems, but the dominant mood was that things were generally OK in America or at least would get better. Even those who didn't share Ronald Reagan's "morning in America" platitudes felt unified in their opposition. And the divisions that existed in the '90s, which is now enjoying its own cultural revival, feel like sandbox tussles compared with the dark polarization of today.
Seinfeld and Springsteen also both became popular in an era when stars still held mass appeal and exerted broad cultural influence. In our current highly performative culture, there's a contrasting authenticity to their respective public personas, which have remained pretty consistent over time. Even as Bruce buddies up to Barack Obama and Jerry rides around in fancy cars, neither comes across as elitist or overtly intellectual.
And there may be particular resonance in the fact that these two quintessential tristate area liberals nonetheless appeal widely to the rest of the country, a rare consensus. Springsteen, of course, channels the hardworking, overlooked American -- the Vietnam vet, the blue-collar worker, the underclass. Seinfeld's shtick is more urban schmo, muddling through daily life, mystified by its absurdities. But in projecting a regular Joe-ness -- no small feat for two middle-class kids turned multimillionaires -- both have a way of making their audiences feel heard.
Even for this particular non-devotee, to witness the intense bond between Springsteen and his fans was an extraordinary experience. During moments of melancholy and mourning ("Last Man Standing" was dedicated to a recently deceased friend from his first band), I could feel the arena audience lock into Springsteen's face. The low calls of "Bruuuce" between songs and the way Springsteen met his fans' raised hands as he walked through the floor toward the end of a three-hour-long night felt like a timeless and almost transcendental communion. "Do you want go home?" Springsteen called out rhythmically to the audience to repeated "Nooooos" in response. They meant it.
Seinfeld's compact set of less than an hour ("Cut everything, cut it," he said to Jimmy Fallon on "The Tonight Show" last fall) likewise left his audience with a palpable desire to stay in that moment. Seinfeld had given them exactly what they came for -- relatable comic set pieces, easy laughs at unfraught topics, bemusement rather than outrage. There was an almost giddy buoyancy in the air, and despite whatever horrors might be going on outside the theater, inside, it felt that everyone was in alignment.
"Seinfeld" is now streaming on Netflix. Springsteen's on Spotify. But there's something about witnessing these performers connect with an audience so ready to meet them that offered a remarkably life-affirming reprieve in this divisive, doomy post-Covid moment. The exuberance, the positivity, this sense of "in it together" felt exactly like what had been missing.

Real or Imagined, Microaggressions Take Their Toll: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: This month's picks include a tense drama about a Kosovan immigrant in Germany, a thriller from Jordan and a Belarusian coming-of-age film set in the 1990s.
'Exile'
Rent it for free on the Goethe-Institut's website.
"It's not necessarily because you're a foreigner ... maybe they dislike you as a person," Nora, the German wife of Kosovan immigrant Xhafer (Misel Maticevic), says in Visar Morina's drama, after her husband relates his feeling of being ostracized at his job. For anyone who's ever experienced racist microaggressions, that statement will cut deep. Everyday bigotry thrives by turning the political into the personal, by making you wonder: Is it society, or is it just me? "Exile" builds a taut thriller around this uncertainty. Xhafer comes home one day to find a dead rat hanging from his door. Already driven up the wall by problems at work -- he is often mistaken for a Croatian; he seems to be routinely left off mailing lists -- he becomes convinced that it's the doing of a xenophobic colleague.
Whether Xhafer is paranoid and deluded or genuinely being persecuted is the film's central mystery, and it brings to light both the real wounds of microaggressions and the ways in which they can be weaponized even by those who suffer their brunt. That Xhafer is treated as an outsider is evident, but his dismissive interactions with a Kosovan cleaning woman at work and colleagues struggling with mental health issues drive home his blinkered self-pity, his indignant indifference to those worse off than him. One of the sharpest films I've seen about the immigrant experience in some time, "Exile" dramatizes Toni Morrison's famous assertion: "The very serious function of racism ... is distraction."
'Another World'
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Starring Vincent Lindon as Philippe, an executive at a multinational firm, this French drama is a sinister vision of corporate amorality -- a slow-burn portrait of how profit-hungry capitalism corrodes people's consciences. The film opens with a divorce settlement meeting that emphasizes how mercenary concerns have invaded every inch of Philippe's life: As their lawyers argue about properties and alimony, he and his estranged wife Anne (Sandrine Kiberlain) recoil at the flattening of their shared life into crude numbers.
From then on, "Another World" unfolds as a Russian roulette of the meetings Philippe takes in icy, impersonal rooms with men and women in suits. In Paris, Philippe pushes futilely against bosses who demand he lay off 10 percent of the staff at the factory he manages, no matter the threat to their safety; at the factory, he struggles to reassure overstretched workers and union leaders who fear for their livelihoods; at a mental health clinic, he and his wife confront the deteriorating psychological state of their son, who's been taken out of college.
The film often cuts abruptly from one setting to the next, bringing into sharp focus Philippe's chameleonic -- but increasingly tortured -- shifts in personality, from aggrieved underling to cruel boss to failing husband and father. But if Lindon brings great tenderness and depth to his role, "Another World" keeps its focus on the system rather than the individual, and on the insidious forces that blur the two.
'The Alleys'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Set on the gritty, mazelike streets of East Amman, Jordan, Bassel Ghandour's thriller moves and turns like a kaleidoscope: In each of its four chapters, characters shuffle about and meet in new configurations, heroes becoming villains and villains becoming victims. At the heart of the film's web of deceptions, conspiracies and deaths is a tale as old as time: a forbidden love affair between Ali (Emad Azmi), a street hustler who pretends that he works for an American company, and Lana (Baraka Rahmani), the daughter of a disapproving salon owner, Aseel (Nadira Omran). When an anonymous voyeur tries to blackmail Aseel with a video of Ali and Lana's secret trysts, the mother goes to Abbas, a local mob boss, for help -- setting off uncontrollable, domino-like consequences.
The film digresses into wry backstories at every turn, relating how Aseel's failed elopement with a good-for-nothing man turned her against love, and how Abbas's sidekick, Hanadi, went from being a prostitute to a fearsome gangster. Somewhere between a mafia movie and a comedy of errors, "The Alleys" turns all its characters into casualties of chance; every twist in this movie is unpredictable, because every character is both morally dubious and somewhat idiotic. What emerges from all the high jinks is a portrait of the striving underclass of Amman, a city whose roil of people and aspirations outpaces even the most determined hustlers.
'Crystal Swan'
Stream it on Tubi and Ovid.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Set in Belarus in the 1990s, Darya Zhuk's slacker comedy gently satirizes the dreams of America that enamored young people in Eastern Europe in the years after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The film follows a feisty punk teenager, Velya (Alina Nasibullina), who yearns to leave behind her worthless boyfriend and hippie mother in Minsk and move to Chicago to hack it as a D.J. She manages to fake an employment letter for her visa interview, but when she realizes that the embassy intends to call the phone number she made up on the application, Velya has to hunt down the house associated with those digits -- a mission that takes her to a small factory town outside of Minsk, and embroils her in the goings-on of a family preparing for a wedding.
The joke of it all is that Velya doesn't need to go to America to experience a foreign land; just a short bus ride away from her hometown is a place starkly unlike her urban milieu, where people live and dream at a much more modest scale. Anchored by a riveting Nasibullina, with her flashing, pastel-lined eyes and insouciant dirty-blond bob, "Crystal Swan" vividly evokes the hunger for individualism in post-Soviet countries and the precariousness of new capitalist realities.
'Myanmar Diaries'
Stream it on Ovid.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Myanmar Diaries" opens with a startling scene that sets the stage for what is to come. A young woman, dressed in bright yellow exercise gear, records a fitness video on the street, bopping cheerily to pop tunes, when black military cars suddenly appear in the background, heading toward the parliament building on the horizon. The invasion of everyday life by authoritarian violence is the subject of this stirring movie, which collages together footage shot by various anonymous Burmese filmmakers in the aftermath of the country's 2021 military coup.
The film creates an urgent audiovisual symphony out of shaky, on-the-ground footage of citizen protests and the terrible violence inflicted by soldiers, and intimate, staged scenes based on testimonies of people living under violence and uncertainty. The documentary sequences confront us with the physical toll of the coup and the military's reckless bloodletting; the fictional scenes, which include animations and horror-tinged set pieces, get at the psychological effects: the fear, the lost dreams, the fractured families. "Myanmar Diaries" is the rare work that captures the now of a historical upheaval, pleading to us to pay attention before a brutal present congeals into the past and determines the future.

Sexual Abuse, Beatings and an Untouchable Sheriff: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Terry Grassaree was dogged for years by questions about how he did his job as a law enforcement officer in Macon, Miss., a tiny, rural town near the state's eastern border.
There were allegations of rape inside the jail that Mr. Grassaree supervised, and lawsuits claiming that he covered up the episodes. At least five people, including one of his fellow deputies, accused him of beating others or choking them with a police baton.
Mr. Grassaree survived it all, rising in the ranks of the Noxubee County Sheriff's office, from a deputy mopping floors, to chief deputy, to the elected position of sheriff, making him one of the most powerful figures in town.
Now, more than three years after losing an election and retiring, and 16 years after a woman first claimed that Mr. Grassaree pressured her to lie about being raped, the former sheriff faces criminal charges.
A federal indictment filed in October accuses him of committing bribery in 2019, near the end of his eight-year tenure as sheriff, and of lying to federal agents when they questioned him about whether he requested sexually explicit photographs and videos from a female inmate. Mr. Grassaree has denied the charges and pleaded not guilty.
But an investigation by The New York Times and the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting at Mississippi Today reveals that allegations of wrongdoing against Mr. Grassaree have been far more wide-ranging and serious than those federal charges suggest. The investigation included a review of nearly two decades of lawsuit depositions and a previously undisclosed report by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.
At a minimum, the documents detail gross mismanagement at the Noxubee County jail that repeatedly put female inmates in harm's way. At worst, they tell the story of a sheriff who operated with impunity, even as he was accused of abusing the people in his custody, turning a blind eye to women who were raped and trying to cover it up when caught.
Over nearly two decades, as allegations mounted and Noxubee County's insurance company paid to settle lawsuits against Mr. Grassaree, state prosecutors brought no charges against him or others accused of abuses in the jail. A federal investigation dragged on for years, and led to charges last fall, a few weeks after reporters started asking authorities about the case.
Even now, no higher authority has reviewed how Mr. Grassaree ran the jail or whether his policies endangered women, because in Mississippi, as in many states, rural sheriffs are left largely to police themselves and their jails.
In 2006, after Mr. Grassaree and his staff left jail cell keys hanging openly on a wall, male inmates opened the doors to the cell of two women inmates and raped them, according to statements the women gave to state investigators. One of the women said Mr. Grassaree pressured her to sign a false statement to cover up the crimes, according to the state police report that has never been made public.
About a year later, in a lawsuit, four people who had been arrested gave sworn statements accusing Mr. Grassaree of violence. Two of the people said he choked or beat them while they were in his custody. A third said he pinned her against a wall and threatened to let a male inmate rape her.
In 2019, a jailed woman told investigators that she had been coerced into having sex with two deputies who offered her a cellphone in exchange for her compliance. Instead of punishing the deputies, she claimed in a lawsuit against the county, Mr. Grassaree demanded that she send him explicit pictures and videos of herself. The federal indictment also accuses Mr. Grassaree of using his cellphone to facilitate a bribe, which experts say could have been the perks the woman says she received.
All told, at least eight men -- including four deputies and Mr. Grassaree himself -- have been accused of sex abuse by women inmates who were being held in the Noxubee County jail while Mr. Grassaree was in charge.
Over the years, the accusations of rape and other misconduct at the jail have been investigated separately by the F.B.I., the Department of Justice and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. No rape or assault charges have been filed.
Mr. Grassaree has denied all of the allegations against him and has faced no disciplinary action. His lawyer declined to comment further.
Holding people accountable for rapes and assaults behind bars is difficult under the best of circumstances. There is little to protect incarcerated victims and witnesses from retaliation for speaking up. When they do come forward, they are often dismissed as not credible, especially if the person accused is a law enforcement officer.
What happened inside the Noxubee jail, and how the authorities responded, is a case study in how those difficulties can be even harder to surmount in rural places, where jails are the exclusive domain of a county sheriff who operates largely without oversight.
No state agency oversees Mississippi's county jails, and no state regulator has the authority to fine a sheriff for endangering people in custody or for failing to train the staff who operate the jail. In 2017, state lawmakers stopped providing funds for jail inspections by the Mississippi Department of Health, removing even the basic requirement that the facilities meet food safety and cleanliness requirements.
"They are closed-off institutions, and the people held inside them are unpopular and politically powerless," said David Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project. "That makes them ripe for neglect and abuse that is entirely foreseeable."
Scott Colom, the elected district attorney for Noxubee County, took office in 2016 and was not involved in the investigation of the 2006 rape allegations.
After learning of the more recent allegations against Mr. Grassaree and his deputies, Mr. Colom said, he notified federal authorities and worked with them on an investigation. Although he believed the evidence against Mr. Grassaree in the case was "clear and strong," Mr. Colom said he knew it would be tough to seat an impartial jury in Noxubee County. He has twice been forced to cancel criminal trials because there were too few potential jurors available, he said, and neither of those cases involved a public official.
Darren J. LaMarca, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi, declined to comment on the case and so did others responsible for investigating the alleged abuses in the Noxubee County jail.
Mr. Grassaree spoke briefly in an interview about his professional history, but would not answer detailed questions about the 2006 rape cases or the more recent allegations related to his federal charges.
Mary Taylor, a retired dispatcher who worked full time at the jail from 1988 to 2017, said in a phone interview that in her years at the jail she never witnessed any sexual abuse.
She said she wasn't working on the day the two women said the rapes took place in 2006, but that she doesn't believe their version of events.
"My belief? They weren't raped," Ms. Taylor said. "They did that to get out of jail."
She maintained that it's "impossible for one man to rape a woman, unless she's not moving, unless it's a Bill Cosby thing."
"They could have yelled out and told somebody," she said. "You can't rape the unwilling."
Building a Tough Reputation
When Terry Grassaree was born in Macon in 1962, the idea that he could one day be sheriff seemed far-fetched.
In Macon, which briefly served as Mississippi's capital during the Civil War, only white men worked as law enforcement officers in those days. The county had a long history of violence against African Americans, including the massacre of 13 Black Mississippians at a church, gunned down by nightriders on a single August night in 1871. The sheriff at the time arrested no one.
Though the county's population is mostly Black, every sheriff elected in Noxubee County was white until 1988, when Albert Walker became the first Black man to hold the office. Mr. Grassaree, his handpicked successor, was the second.
Mr. Grassaree started his law enforcement career as a police officer in Macon and in nearby Brooksville, and sold insurance on the side to help make ends meet. Sheriff Walker hired him as a county deputy in 1992 and put him to work mopping floors, among other duties, at the county jail. Mr. Grassaree was also a deputy coroner, paid $ 85 for each body he handled.
He worked his way up to chief deputy, and took on running the jail.
Mr. Grassaree, known to keep order by issuing physical threats, said in an interview last year that he drew inspiration from the professional wrestler "Stone Cold" Steve Austin.
"Even while they were whipping him, he was still the toughest guy on the mat," Mr. Grassaree said. "He's like, 'Is that all you've got?' No matter how long a man whips you, he will get tired. He might think he's winning. The only thing you've got to do is hold out."
This idea, he said, became the foundation for how he behaved when he put on his uniform.
Early in his career, he beefed his 6-foot-2 frame up to 230 pounds, and people started calling him "Big Dog." Not many people crossed him after that, he said.
His reputation for being aggressive spread across town. In a 2006 letter to the editor in the local paper, a mother complained that Mr. Grassaree had threatened her 16-year-old son. The boy, she wrote, had fought with Mr. Grassaree's son at school.
The editor of the same newspaper, The Macon Beacon, arrived to cover an arrest near a nightclub in 2000 and snapped a picture of Mr. Grassaree kneeling on a man's neck. The photo made the front page.
People who passed through the jail describe being attacked by Mr. Grassaree when he thought they were causing trouble. Four people gave sworn statements about such attacks as part of a 2005 lawsuit against Mr. Grassaree and Noxubee County filed by former deputy Kendrick Slaughter. In the lawsuit, Mr. Slaughter claimed that Mr. Grassaree tried to bribe him not to run for City Council, and then hauled him to jail for talking to the F.B.I. about the alleged bribe.
Noxubee County's insurance company settled the suit for an undisclosed amount.
The four sworn statements accuse Mr. Grassaree of a number of violent acts, which he has denied committing. One man wrote that while he was handcuffed in a courtroom in 2002, Mr. Grassaree beat him until a judge came off the bench to rescue him.
Another man said in his sworn statement that Mr. Grassaree choked him with his nightstick and warned him to follow his orders. The man said Mr. Grassaree told him, "I'll shoot you in the head! I'm the Big Dog! I'm Number One! This my jail!"
A 19-year-old woman said Mr. Grassaree hit her twice with his nightstick and threw her against a wall after accusing her of stealing potato chips from a man held in jail. Mr. Grassaree "spread my legs apart with his foot," she said in her deposition.
Then, she said, he told her that he ought to let the inmate rape her.
A Jail With No Rules
The jail that Mr. Grassaree oversaw for most of his career sits frozen in time on Industrial Road on the outskirts of Macon, next to the old Purina pet food mill that now produces feed for catfish farms.
The building has been locked and empty since about 2014, when Mr. Grassaree and his deputies packed up and began moving to a new facility down the street. Inside the old jail, a blackened mix of dirt, rust and mold has crept over the white iron cell doors. Bags of trash and dusty bed linens litter the remaining furniture and the floor.
When Mr. Grassaree was put in charge of this building in the 1990s, he inherited a jailhouse that essentially operated without rules. Jail workers allowed inmates to come and go from the building without logging the inmates' movements or supervising them closely.
The only policies about the jail that appear in the 2003 Noxubee County Sheriff's Policy Manual center on the use of force. None tell how to run the jail.
For years, certain inmates were let out of their cells to help cook, pass out food trays and clean.
Kennedy Brewer, who entered the jail in 2002, was one of the facility's most trusted inmates. Eyebrows were raised when he showed up at a court hearing on his own, having driven himself to the courthouse without a deputy to escort him, according to Forrest Allgood, the district attorney at the time.
Mr. Brewer spent five years at the jail waiting to be retried after DNA evidence proved he had been wrongly convicted of sexually abusing and murdering a 3-year-old girl. When prosecutors gave up on a new trial, Mr. Brewer was released, and his case was featured in the Netflix documentary series, "The Innocence Files."
Testifying under oath as a witness in a lawsuit in 2007, Mr. Brewer said he served as a jail trusty, or an inmate with special privileges, and had access to keys that opened each cell. He said he would check newly arrested people into the jail and that he once escorted an inmate to a cell with no one else present.
Mr. Grassaree has denied that inmates were allowed to use jail keys without supervision.
On a June day in 2006, Mr. Brewer had no problem getting into the women's cell block undetected.
He grabbed the jailer's keys off the nail hanging on the wall and slipped down the short hallway that ran the length of the jail. In a building smaller than a McDonald's, he and a fellow inmate didn't have to go far. There were no guards patrolling the halls and no surveillance cameras to catch any movements.
When Mr. Brewer unlocked the cell door, one of the women inside was lying down for a nap.
Then Brewer was on top of her, grabbing her arms and forcing her down, according to statements the woman later gave to state agents.
"No, I don't want to do this," she begged, according to her statements.
Then she looked for her cellmate, Jessie Levette Douglas. She told investigators she saw another inmate, Laterris Goodwin, on top of her.
It was all over in moments.
The woman who originally reported the rapes declined to be interviewed for this article. Ms. Douglas died of renal failure in a state prison in 2018.
When investigators interview rape victims, they are supposed to remain impartial. But when Mr. Grassaree, who was chief deputy at the time, found the woman crying on the floor, he stood over her and shouted, the woman said in a deposition taken as part of her subsequent lawsuit against the county. He and another member of the sheriff's office yelled that she couldn't tell anybody about the rape and that she was "going to make them lose their jobs and make the department look bad," according to her sworn statement.
"They kept berating me as if I had done something wrong," she said.
When state agents arrived the next day at the request of the sheriff's office, Mr. Grassaree handed them everything they needed to dismiss the allegations, including signed statements from two of the men saying the women had invited them to have sex, and more important, a statement from Ms. Douglas saying everything she saw and experienced was consensual.
If Mr. Grassaree and his deputies had been in charge of the investigation, it might have ended there. But when state agents interviewed Ms. Douglas, her story changed.
She told investigators that she and her cellmate had been raped that day and that she lied in her first statement because Mr. Grassaree had pressured her to cover up what happened.
Mr. Grassaree "told me to tell everybody the sex was consensual and that for me to 'help a brother,' referring to Brewer," Ms. Douglas wrote in a later statement. "He told me to tell everybody that we put on a freak show for the male inmates."
In reality, Ms. Douglas told the agents, three men incarcerated at the jail -- Mr. Brewer, Mr. Goodwin and Michael Slaughter -- had entered her locked cell at different times on the same day and had raped her.
In statements to investigators, Mr. Slaughter, Mr. Brewer and Mr. Goodwin denied that they had raped the women, claiming that the sex was consensual.
In an interview from 2022, Mr. Brewer denied ever having sex with anyone inside the jail. Neither Mr. Slaughter nor Mr. Goodwin could be reached for comment.
Both women were given polygraph tests, and the examiner concluded that they were telling the truth, according to state investigators' records. Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Slaughter failed polygraph tests; Mr. Brewer declined to take one.
State agents shared their findings with federal and state prosecutors, and the case was presented to a Noxubee County grand jury. The grand jury decided not to issue charges.
Legal experts say Mr. Grassaree could have been investigated for obstructing justice in the case. That never happened, and neither did an investigation of practices in the jail, where agents concluded that four rapes had taken place.
Noxubee County's insurance company settled the woman's lawsuit in 2009. The Macon Beacon reported that she was paid $ 375,000.
Sabrina Campbell said her sister, Ms. Douglas -- the woman who said she was raped by three inmates and who died many years later -- wanted the public to know what happened to her. "I don't want my sister to have died in vain," Ms. Campbell said.
The rapes devastated her sister, who never stopped battling nightmares afterward, she said. "She was scared all the time. She would tell nieces and nephews about the jail, 'Don't ever come here, because your life is over."'
Another Round of Allegations
Allegations of sexual abuse at the Noxubee County jail did not end with the 2006 case.
In 2020, Elizabeth Layne Reed, a woman incarcerated at the jail, made explosive allegations against the men she encountered there. In a lawsuit she filed that year, she accused two deputies, Vance Phillips and Damon Clark, of coercing her into having sex.
She said the men gave her a cellphone and other perks so that she would have sexual encounters with them in remote spots around the jail or when the deputies checked her out of the facility. The deputies even put a sofa in her jail cell, she said.
Ms. Reed said in an interview that she wanted the public to know what happened to her in the hope that others would come forward. "It made me terrified to trust anybody," she said. "Women in jail and prison need to be protected."
According to her lawsuit, Mr. Grassaree knew all about his deputies' "sexual contacts and shenanigans," but did nothing to "stop the coerced sexual relationships." Mr. Grassaree denied any knowledge of what deputies were doing. "Are you a boss?" he said. "Do your employees tell you everything they do?"
Instead of intervening, the lawsuit alleged, the sheriff "sexted" her and demanded that she use the phone the deputies had given her to send him "a continuous stream of explicit videos, photographs and texts" while she was in jail. She also alleged in the lawsuit that Mr. Grassaree touched her in a "sexual manner."
The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount.
News outlets in Mississippi made brief mention of the lawsuit, but government officials at all levels, including federal and state prosecutors, were silent for two years about what, if anything, they were doing to investigate the allegations it raised, and whether they had found evidence to support them.
A review by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and The New York Times of documents filed in the lawsuit, along with documents from the preceding 2019 state investigation, reveals that Ms. Reed accused other deputies besides Mr. Phillips and Mr. Clark of sexual harassment and abuse. None of the other deputies have been charged or named publicly. It is unclear whether the F.B.I. investigated those allegations.
The federal bureau's investigation into Mr. Grassaree, Mr. Phillips and Mr. Clark took more than two years to yield charges, even though investigators had confessions of sexual contact from the deputies as well as text messages between the woman and the three men. In fall of 2022, several weeks after reporters began asking authorities about the case, Mr. LaMarca successfully sought indictments against Mr. Grassaree and Mr. Phillips on bribery charges. Mr. Clark has not been indicted.
Ms. Reed hoped that other deputies, including Mr. Clark, would be held accountable, she said. "They're still walking around free, not worried about any charges."
Ms. Reed said that she felt sick to her stomach when she found out that neither Mr. Grassaree nor Mr. Phillips had been directly charged in connection with her allegations of sex abuse. Lawyers for Mr. Phillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Clark could not be reached for comment.
The indictments do not mention sexual abuse. Along with bribery, Mr. Grassaree was also charged with lying to the F.B.I. in denying that he had "requested and received" nude photos and videos from Ms. Reed. A trial is scheduled for summer.
Julie Abbate, who served as the deputy chief of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division from 2003 to 2018 and reviewed the allegations at the news organizations' request, said the federal prosecutors could have explored criminal charges against Mr. Grassaree and his deputies for violating the civil rights of women in his facility.
The question of whether to bring federal charges in the case may have been complicated by guidance the Department of Justice issued in 2018, saying that law enforcement officers cannot be federally prosecuted for violating a person's civil rights if the person "truly made a voluntary decision as to what she wanted to do with her body," particularly if she received a benefit or special treatment in exchange for sex.
But Ms. Reed's decisions in the episode in the Noxubee County jail were "not free-will choices," said Andrea Armstrong, a law professor at Loyola University, and the cellphone Ms. Reed received from deputies "was the vehicle by which more abuse could be directed towards her."
Mississippi law makes it a crime for law enforcement officers to engage in sexual acts with incarcerated people. Prosecutors are not required to prove the victims were physically overpowered or even that they told their abuser to stop.
But the district attorney's office that handles criminal cases in Noxubee County chose to pass the 2020 case on to federal prosecutors, instead of seeking charges under the state law, because of worries about getting a fair jury in the county. When asked about federal prosecutors' decision to charge Mr. Grassaree and Mr. Phillips with bribery in the case, the district attorney, Mr. Colom, said, "I trust federal authorities to use the best statutes."
Ms. Abbate said the allegations about abuses in the Noxubee County jail were indicative of a larger, pervasive problem at the facility and a harmful culture inside the sheriff's office. That culture, she said, undoubtedly endangered inmates and allowed abuses to continue.
"The allegations that come to light are almost always just the tip of the iceberg," said Ms. Abbate, who is now director of Just Detention International, an organization dedicated to ending sexual abuse in correctional facilities. Referring to the 2006 and 2020 cases, she said, "I guarantee you that these two instances are not the only ones."

'Mario' Film Ignites Hope For Recovery: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The film's blockbuster opening weekend raised hopes that animation, once one of Hollywood's safest bets, had recovered from the pandemic.
Movie theaters have struggled to recover from the pandemic, in part, because the once-reliable family audience has wandered. Last year, family-oriented films -- largely animation -- represented 17 percent of worldwide ticket sales, about half of what they were in 2019.
Over the weekend, however, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" from Universal Pictures turned out families on a jaw-dropping scale, generating an estimated $ 146.4 million in ticket sales at theaters in the United States and Canada, for a total of $ 204.6 million since arriving on Wednesday. The PG-rated movie cost Illumination Entertainment and Nintendo roughly $ 100 million to make.
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie," about Brooklyn plumbers who get zapped into a magical and treacherous realm known as the Mushroom Kingdom, collected an additional $ 173 million overseas -- a result that one Hollywood trade news site called "plumb insane," noting that it was on a par with results for Universal mega-franchises like "Fast and Furious" and "Jurassic World."
Are family movies back -- all the way back, to the degree that Hollywood can once again count on them as relative sure things?
Studio executives and movie theater owners were practically doing cartwheels over the weekend while shouting, "Yes!"
"This is just extraordinary," Jim Orr, Universal's president of domestic theatrical distribution, said on Sunday. "The numbers just kept growing and growing as the weekend went on."
Box office analysts were more cautious. As the dominant provider of family entertainment, Walt Disney Studios needs to deliver a theatrical animated hit before a true recovery can be declared, said David A. Gross, a film consultant and box office authority. The last five animated movies that Disney has released in theaters have been ticket-selling disappointments. (Those include "Strange World" and "Lightyear" last year, and "Encanto," "Raya and the Last Dragon" and "Ron's Gone Wrong" in 2021, a pandemic-affected year.)
"Still some question marks hanging around family movies," Mr. Gross said in an email. Disney has two animated movies coming up: "Elemental," set in a world where residents are made of fire, water, earth and air, arrives in June; and "Wish," a musical about a young girl and a star that falls from the sky, is due in November.
Taking the children to the movies can be expensive -- as much as $ 110 for a family of four in New York City, and that is without popcorn ( $ 9.29 for a small) or a single soda ( $ 7). Families also became accustomed to watching new animated movies at home during the pandemic, when Disney debuted Pixar films like "Luca," "Turning Red" and "Soul" on its streaming service, bypassing theaters completely. Streaming-service movies are "free," or so it can seem for anyone who already subscribes to Disney+ ( $ 8 a month for the basic version).
For the weekend in North America, "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" was easily No. 1. Second place was a bit of a photo finish, with "John Wick: Chapter 4" (Lionsgate), "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves" (Paramount) and "Air" (Amazon) each estimated to have collected about $ 14 million.
"Air," directed by Ben Affleck, collected roughly $ 20 million since arriving on Wednesday on 3,500 domestic movie screens, a total that Mr. Gross called "excellent." He noted that sports dramas -- "Air" is about Nike's efforts in the 1980s to lure a young Michael Jordan to its struggling basketball brand -- tended to arrive to about $ 5.4 million in ticket sales.
The turnout for "Air" validated Amazon's decision to release the well-reviewed film in theaters, where it will play exclusively for at least a month before becoming available on the company's Prime Video streaming service. For deep-pocketed Amazon, the theatrical release is something of a loss leader -- a way for Prime Video to compete for top talent, who want their films seen on big screens. Analysts estimated that Amazon paid $ 130 million for the rights to "Air" and spent an additional $ 50 million on marketing.
"Air" is the first movie from Artists Equity, a production company formed by Mr. Affleck, Matt Damon and RedBird Capital.
But the weekend belonged to "The Super Mario Bros. Movie." Among certain demographics, the film felt like a cultural event, or what Mr. Gross called "moviegoing urgency in action." That was no accident: Marketers at Universal carpet-bombed televised sporting events (March Madness, N.F.L. championship games, the N.B.A. All-Star Game, the Super Bowl) with promos and orchestrated a stunt on "The Tonight Show" in which members of the movie's voice cast (Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Keegan-Michael Key) sang the Mario theme song.
Universal's theme parks around the world helped stoke the fire. Universal Studios Hollywood recently opened Super Nintendo World, a lavishly themed expansion that features the Brothers Mario. The attraction has been a runaway success, with early-entry tickets sold out every day since it opened on Feb. 17.
Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst, noted that "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" delivered the biggest opening on record for an animated film that's not a sequel, dethroning "The Secret Life of Pets" (2016), and the second-biggest opening on record for an animated movie. "Incredibles 2" (Disney-Pixar) ranks as No. 1, having collected $ 183 million over its first three days in 2018.
Universal has transformed itself into an animation superpower under the leadership of its chairwoman, Donna Langley. She oversees two cartoon factories: Illumination, founded by Chris Meledandri ("Despicable Me," "Ice Age"), and DreamWorks Animation, which made "Puss in Boots: The Last Wish," an Oscar-nominated sequel that arrived to a paltry $ 12.4 million in ticket sales in December and ultimately collected $ 480 million worldwide. Universal's upcoming animated films include "Strays," an R-rated canine comedy scheduled for theatrical release in June. The studio is also working to reboot the "Shrek" franchise.
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie" received mixed to negative reviews. But its instant success among ticket buyers -- who gave the film an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls -- adds to a recent trend in Hollywood: Studios, scrounging for established, globally appealing intellectual property, seem to have finally cracked the code on adapting video games for the big screen.
The movie industry's troubled history with the genre started 30 years ago, when the first video game-based movie, "Super Mario Bros.," became a hall-of-fame misfire. In recent years, studios have become newly enamored with game adaptations, leading to successes like "Sonic the Hedgehog" (Paramount) and "Pokémon Detective Pikachu" (Warner Bros.). On television, "The Last of Us" (HBO) and "The Witcher" (Netflix) are game-based hits.
Mr. Orr, the Universal distribution president, noted that "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," which played in 3,343 theaters in the United States and Canada, benefited from nostalgia. Nintendo introduced its Mario Bros. games in the 1980s. About 26 percent of the weekend audience was older than 35.
"Illumination and Nintendo collaborated to make a movie that fans love," Mr. Orr said. "People wanted to come out and be fully entertained by these characters they have known for decades."

Basketball, War and Sleepaway Camp in Earlier Times: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: This month's picks include a film about a summer camp for the disabled, a portrait of a defense secretary's regrets about the Vietnam War and one of the best sport documentaries of all time.
The proliferation of documentaries on streaming services makes it difficult to choose what to watch. Each month, we'll choose three nonfiction films -- classics, overlooked recent docs and more -- that will reward your time.
'Hoop Dreams' (1994)
Stream it on the Criterion Channel, HBO Max, Peacock, Tubi and Vudu.
With March Madness in full swing, it is as good a time as ever to revisit "Hoop Dreams," certainly the best film ever made about the pipeline that takes young basketball players from blacktops in impoverished city neighborhoods to high school athletics and eventually college teams, with a promise of success that will elude all but a small few. Touching on issues of race, economics, education and exploitation, it follows the players and their families through the late 1980s and early 1990s. In sheer scope and by popular acclamation, it is one of the most extraordinary, compassionate and committed of all documentaries.
Directed by Steve James, "Hoop Dreams" semi-separately observes two teenagers from different neighborhoods in Chicago -- William Gates, from the rowhouses of the Cabrini-Green housing project, and Arthur Agee, from the Garfield Park area of the city's west side -- whose lives occasionally intersect. Both are invited to play for St. Joseph High School, a well-appointed private Catholic school a 90-minute commute away in the suburbs. St. Joseph's lures students with the expectation that they might become the next Isiah Thomas, an alumnus turned N.B.A. sensation. Thomas's high school coach, Gene Pingatore, is still basking in that glory and is happy to name-drop "Isiah." Pingatore lives in the apparent hope that lightning will strike twice.
But this isn't a film about how Agee and Gates made it to the N.B.A. Quite the contrary: It is a chronicle of how their hoop dreams are deferred at nearly every turn, and of how the big-money machinery of institutional basketball cares little for the people it ensnares. The subjects' fates are nearly always poised on a financial precipice.
When Agee, who has a partial scholarship, falls behind on tuition, St. Joseph's forces him to leave, even withholding his transcript from his public school until his parents -- a mother who has lost her minimum-wage job as a nurse's assistant and a father who has just rejoined the family after grappling with addiction and incarceration -- can cover the balance. His coach at his new school suggests that were Agee playing at the level St. Joseph's had expected, money wouldn't have been an issue. Gates receives financial help on top of his scholarship, but a knee injury sidelines him. Even after recovering, he is under pressure to play when he probably shouldn't. A potential college scholarship hinges on an ACT score that seems just out of reach. His brother, whose own basketball ambitions were dashed, lives vicariously through him. And almost incidentally, Gates is a new father, determined to be better than his own largely absent dad, in a movie that has a lot to say about parents' hopes for their children.
'The Fog of War' (2003)

Just two months after the start of the Iraq War, Errol Morris, at Cannes, unveiled a film in which Robert S. McNamara, one of the key American officials who oversaw the Vietnam War, reflected on that conflict with something like remorse. Although the documentary was about events that had occurred more than three decades earlier, it couldn't have been timelier when it opened 20 years ago -- not least because archival images of the polished, technocratic McNamara smiling and delivering sanguine news about Vietnam couldn't help but call to mind then-current images of George W. Bush's defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, selling the invasion of Iraq, or because of McNamara's assertion that the United States should not ever apply its military power unilaterally.
In "The Fog of War," which went on to win Morris his only Oscar so far, the 85-year-old McNamara, the defense secretary under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, tries to draw conclusions about his experiences during Vietnam and in World War II, when he was involved in the firebombing of Japan. ("What makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?" he asks of that campaign.)
When it comes to Vietnam, McNamara is both reflective and deflective, suggesting that he was not the warmonger he was portrayed as and was instead primarily executing President Johnson's wishes -- and that had President Kennedy lived, he would have found a way to limit the conflict's scale. ("I don't think we would have had 500,000 men there," McNamara says.) At other times, McNamara's downplaying is less persuasive. "I'm not really sure I authorized Agent Orange -- I don't remember it," he says, "but it certainly occurred, the use of it occurred while I was secretary."
At the time, critics wondered if Morris was essentially having the wool pulled over his eyes. (It's a familiar charge against the filmmaker, who faced similar accusations with his documentary on Steve Bannon, "American Dharma.") But the portrait of McNamara is too complex to qualify as a simple exoneration. In one of the most jaw-dropping moments, McNamara recalls meeting in 1995 with Nguyen Co Thach, Vietnam's former foreign minister, and being blindsided by Thach's assertion that the Vietnamese had seen themselves as fighting for their independence, not as pawns of the Chinese or the Russians. How, Thach apparently asked, could McNamara not have known that? The premise for his entire war was wrong.
Morris went on to address the Iraq War head-on in "Standard Operating Procedure" and the Rumsfeld portrait "The Unknown Known," both of which are in the news again with the 20th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. But perhaps neither of them so directly confronts the issue of guilt, an emotion to which McNamara, in the film's closing moments, declines to admit. "I'd rather be damned if I don't," he says.

Before she was a disability rights activist, Judy Heumann, who died earlier this month at 75, was a counselor at Camp Jened, which operated as a sleepaway camp for the disabled from the 1950s through the 1970s. The movie argues that the ties and friendships formed there -- at a time when disabled teenagers had few shared spaces to connect freely and be themselves -- laid the groundwork for the American disability rights movement, especially once several former campers gathered in the revolutionary ferment of Berkeley, Calif., in the 1970s.
Incredibly, the directors, Nicole Newnham and Jim LeBrecht, who attended the camp himself, have footage of the campers as campers, in vintage material shot by a collective called the People's Video Theater -- which means there's a pleasing then-and-now quality to the movie. Heumann is introduced at age 23 conducting a vote on whether the campers should cook lasagna on a Wednesday evening -- a humble origin story for an activist who, among many other achievements, would help lead a multiweek sit-in in San Francisco in 1977 to ensure the implementation of federal protections for the disabled. (Lots of other Jened alumni are identified in images from that demonstration as well.) Much later on, Heumann became a special adviser for international disability rights at the State Department under President Obama, who is one of this documentary's executive producers.
Heumann is just one of many campers we get to meet in this engaging, inspiring film. They include LeBrecht himself (who has worked in sound design) and the couple Neil Jacobson and Denise Sherer Jacobson. Denise tells the story of how she chose to pursue a master's degree in human sexuality after she unnecessarily had her appendix removed, because a doctor had failed to consider that a patient with cerebral palsy just might have a sexually transmitted disease.

Full text: Yusef Salaam, one of the wrongly imprisoned Central Park Five, is running in a competitive City Council race in Harlem. He described the former president's indictment as "karma."
Not long after Donald J. Trump surrendered at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse on Tuesday, becoming the first former president to face criminal charges, Yusef Salaam, a candidate for a City Council seat in Harlem, sent out a statement.
Mr. Salaam, 49, was one of five Black and Latino men exonerated in 2002 in the rape and assault of a female jogger in Central Park in 1989. Mr. Trump stoked the racist and sensationalized reaction to the case by taking out full-page advertisements in four city newspapers, including The New York Times, calling for the death penalty to be reinstated.
Decades later, even after Mr. Salaam and the others, who were imprisoned as teenagers and known as the Central Park Five, had been cleared by the confession of another man and DNA evidence, Mr. Trump refused to apologize to them.
"Now that you have been indicted and are facing criminal charges, I do not resort to hatred, bias or racism -- as you once did," Mr. Salaam, who spent almost seven years in prison, wrote in the statement, a fund-raising email made to look like the ad Mr. Trump published in 1989. "I hope that you exercise your civil liberties to the fullest, and that you get what the Exonerated Five did not get -- a presumption of innocence and a fair trial."
Mr. Trump's indictment and Mr. Salaam's history with the former president have generated new interest in his campaign, with more volunteers, a slight uptick in donations and several appearances on MSNBC.
Mr. Salaam, who speaks with the cadence of a preacher and the optimism of a motivational speaker, bounced between quoting James Baldwin, Neo from "The Matrix," his mother and his mentor Les Brown, a former politician and life coach, as he remarked that the timing of Mr. Trump's indictment was no coincidence.
"As he is back in the media, the beautiful side of the story is back in the media as well," Mr. Salaam said. "The five who triumphed and what they are doing now. What platforms are they using to push the needle forward?"
For Mr. Salaam, that platform is running for City Council in the same neighborhood where he grew up and where his life was forever altered. While all 51 Council seats are up for election this year, the race in Harlem, where gentrification and demographic shifts, including the loss of Black residents, are major issues, is expected to be one of the most competitive in the city.
Mr. Salaam will face several candidates in a crowded Democratic primary this June, including the incumbent, Kristin Richardson Jordan, a first-term councilwoman who has faced criticism over her response to the killing of two police officers in her district and her opposition to an affordable housing development.
Longtime residents of neighborhoods like Harlem are concerned about crime and affordability, said Yvette Buckner, a political strategist and the board chair of the New Majority NYC, a group that helped elect the first-ever female majority on the City Council.
"If you're seeing Black people leave in droves, you want to make sure a place like Harlem, which has so much rich history and culture and empowerment, is a place that actually can be affordable for Black people," Ms. Buckner said.
Mr. Salaam speaks about the need for average incomes in Harlem to increase and how residents have lost out on opportunity more broadly.
"It's one thing to say we need affordable housing. Yes, we do. We need more of it and we need it now," Mr. Salaam said. "It's another thing to say we need proper education. It's another thing to say that we need safe streets. All of those things are things that we desperately need. And we need it now because we are taxpayers."
He hopes that Harlem residents can learn from his journey to overcome trauma. "This is a renewal of my life, and therefore this can be a renewal for the whole of Harlem," Mr. Salaam said.
Mr. Salaam and the four men who were convicted alongside him -- Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Antron McCray -- say the police coerced them into false confessions. Their convictions were vacated in 2002 after the Manhattan district attorney's office determined that the attack against the jogger had been committed by a man named Matias Reyes.
The city settled a civil rights lawsuit with the five men for $ 41 million in 2014. Netflix produced a mini-series focused on the case. Last year, an entrance to Central Park in Harlem became the Gate of the Exonerated, the first park entrance to be named since 1862.
Mr. Salaam now serves on the board of the Innocence Project and has written a memoir. He is married and has a blended family with 10 children, ages 7 to 27. In spite of all the good things that have happened since he was released from prison, Mr. Salaam said the pain caused by Mr. Trump's ad persists more than 30 years later.
"I want to hate these muggers and murderers," Mr. Trump wrote. "They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes."
Mr. Salaam saw those words as not just an indictment of him and his friends but of all Black and Latino New Yorkers. "You see those Black and brown people, just be afraid of them," he said.
Shortly after it was announced that Mr. Trump had been indicted last week, Mr. Salaam sent out a simple statement: "Karma."
Keith L.T. Wright, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Manhattan, said he had recruited Mr. Salaam to run for the seat, urging him to move back to New York from Georgia, which he did late last year.
"His story in many ways is no different than thousands upon thousands of young Black and brown men in terms of interactions with the criminal justice system," Mr. Wright said. "He's not a politician, but I think the community needs him."
Mr. Salaam wore a wide brimmed hat, leather gloves and a dark wool coat with a scarf draped dramatically over his shoulders, as he canvassed voters outside the subway station at 135th Street and Lenox Avenue this week.
Standing by his side, as she was when he was charged as a teenager, was his mother, Sharonne Salaam, handing out fliers adorned with her son's picture.
"We are hopeful that whatever Trump did, he gets the justice he deserves," said Ms. Salaam. "And we are still waiting for that apology."
Mr. Salaam received varying looks of recognition from subway riders. Andre Hill, 57, a barber, shouted: "I remember you," as he came out of the subway station.
"He was framed," said Mr. Hill. "I also remember when Donald Trump tried to put them brothers away. He's a clown."
Darlene Celeste, 64, a program manager, put down her bags to speak with Mr. Salaam even though she was rushing to work because she found his perseverance inspiring.
"They were guilty without having a chance at being proven innocent," said Ms. Celeste, who called Mr. Trump's ad "despicable" and a form of "lynching."
The current members of the Council are serving shortened two-year terms because of redistricting. In addition to Ms. Jordan, the Democratic primary field for the Harlem seat includes Assemblywoman Inez E. Dickens, who formerly held it, and Assemblyman Al Taylor.
When Mr. Salaam announced his candidacy, Ms. Jordan released a statement that took aim, in part, at the size of the settlement he and the other four men had received: "I think we have enough millionaires in office already."
Mr. Salaam declined to criticize Ms. Jordan this week, except to say that he believed his candidacy was about bringing leadership to Harlem. In response, Ms. Jordan said she was not interested in "getting in the mud" with those who were being "mean-spirited" toward her.
"Clearly any administration would need more than 15 months," she wrote in a text message. "I am proud of how much we have done in so little time."
Asked about his lack of political experience, which his opponents have made an issue of, Mr. Salaam said it meant he had no "hidden agendas."
As for Mr. Trump's arrest, Mr. Salaam said it was not something that he celebrated.
"It wasn't a moment where I threw my fist in the air," Mr. Salaam said. "But it was a moment where people were trying to get justice against a powerful person who was skirting, or appearing to skirt, the law."

France Leads the List Of the Global Ultrarich: [Correction]

Full text: Two French business titans, Bernard Arnault of the LVMH empire and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers of L'Oréal, are named the world's wealthiest man and woman.
PARIS -- France, which has been riven lately by angry protests over income inequality, can now claim to have the world's richest man and woman: Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, the heiress of the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal.
Their combined net worth is nearly $ 300 billion, according to Forbes's latest tally.
Mr. Arnault, 74, whose worldwide domain encompasses 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton handbags, Tiffany diamond rings, Christian Dior dresses and Sephora high-end cosmetics, leaped past American technology titans with a fortune estimated at $ 211 billion as of March 10, when the Forbes figures were tallied.
Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, 69, who has led the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest women for three straight years, had an estimated net worth of $ 80.5 billion. A granddaughter of L'Oréal's founder, she is on the company's board and together with her husband makes many of the controlling decisions. Her company's international cosmetics brands include Kiehl's, Lancôme, Maybelline New York and Essie.
The eye-popping figures, which include the billionaires' personal holdings of company stocks, testify to the resilience of wealthy consumers against a cost-of-living crisis, as high earners continued to splurge on luxury goods -- especially in the wake of pandemic lockdowns. L'Oréal had global sales of over $ 38 billion last year, while LVMH had record revenue of $ 80 billion.
"More people are flocking to spending on luxury goods after having survived Covid lockdowns," said Luca Solca, chief luxury goods analyst at Bernstein. "The middle class did suffer and is hollowing out. But the wealthy were untouched, and the upper middle class is spending on all fronts."
High-flying technology companies, on the other hand, have faced a major reckoning over the past year amid a surge in interest rates, high inflation and uncertain economic conditions. Rapid growth during the pandemic has been followed by widespread layoffs, and a nearly 30 percent slump in tech shares last year cut sharply into the fortunes of Elon Musk, owner of Twitter and Tesla, and Amazon's executive chairman, Jeff Bezos. Mr. Musk slipped to second place in Forbes's rankings, with an estimated fortune of $ 180 billion, and Mr. Bezos came in third with $ 114 billion.
The Forbes rankings caused a sensation in France this week, touching off a new round of headlines about income inequality and igniting debates over whether the ultrarich have augmented their fortunes by paying too little in taxes.
The country has been gripped by strikes and increasingly violent street demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron's pension overhaul, which intends to raise the minimum age of retirement to 64 from 62. But the nationwide demonstrations -- another is scheduled for Thursday -- have also become rallying points for a broader protest over a glaring wealth divide. In France, the richest 10 percent hold nearly half of the country's wealth, and the growth of that share has outpaced that held by the rest of the population, according to the French statistics agency Insee. Wealth "remains very unevenly distributed among the population," the agency said.
Many of the protesters have made Mr. Arnault a main target for their ire, wielding unflattering posters and images of the multibillionaire as the symbol of a deeper problem afflicting the country.
"Mr. Arnault is seen as the embodiment of the ultrarich," said Philippe Escande, an economics columnist for the newspaper Le Monde. "But France is a country where equality -- namely 'liberté, égalité and fraternité' -- is very important, dating all the way back to the Revolution," he said. "There is a problem with money."
Coinciding with the rise in Mr. Arnault's fortunes has been a visible flexing of LVMH's muscle around central Paris: Across the city, four-story-high billboards trumpet LVMH brands. The Champs-Élysées is dominated by a massive Dior building being refurbished next to a Louis Vuitton flagship store. On Wednesday, a day ahead of new protests, the militant CGT labor union unfurled a banner atop the Arc de Triomphe, within eyeshot of Mr. Arnault's boutiques, denouncing a higher retirement age. Critics say higher taxes on the rich could bolster pension accounts and avoid the need to raise the retirement age.
Mr. Arnault has shot back, pointing out that his company hired 40,000 people globally in 2022, and invested 5 billion euros ( $ 5.5 billion) in new stores and workshops in France.
He has also been preparing to keep his empire a family affair for generations. In moves worthy of the HBO hit "Succession," Mr. Arnault has taken pains to extend his own retirement age to 80, and within the last year has placed each of his five adult children into a strategic position within the group, setting up a battle over who might ascend to his perch.
Overall, the Forbes list showed that Europe's billionaires have made their money in traditional sectors, such as luxury, retail, consumer goods, food and industrial companies. Almost none of its billionaires are technology chiefs, the bulk of those coming from the United States and China.
"In two or three years, tech is likely to be back" at the top of the list of richest earners, Mr. Escande said, reflecting the continued economic power of the United States and China.
In Europe, "we still don't have anything comparable to Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google," he noted, "even after trying for 20 years."

NEW YORK — Not long after Donald Trump surrendered at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse in New York on Tuesday, becoming the first former president to face criminal charges, Yusef Salaam, a candidate for a City Council seat in Harlem, sent out a statement.

Trump’s indictment and Salaam’s history with the former president have generated new interest in his campaign, with more volunteers, a slight uptick in donations and several appearances on MSNBC.
Salaam, who speaks with the cadence of a preacher and the optimism of a motivational speaker, bounced among quoting James Baldwin; Neo from “The Matrix”; his mother; and his mentor Les Brown, a former politician and life coach, as he remarked that the timing of Trump’s indictment was no coincidence.
“As he is back in the media, the beautiful side of the story is back in the media as well,” Salaam said. “The five who triumphed and what they are doing now. What platforms are they using to push the needle forward?”

He hopes that Harlem residents can learn from his journey to overcome trauma. “This is a renewal of my life, and therefore, this can be a renewal for the whole of Harlem,” Salaam said.

“We are hopeful that whatever Trump did, he gets the justice he deserves,” Sharonne Salaam said. “And we are still waiting for that apology.”
Yusef Salaam received varying looks of recognition from subway riders. Andre Hill, 57, a barber, shouted, “I remember you,” as he came out of the subway station.
“He was framed,” Hill said. “I also remember when Donald Trump tried to put them brothers away. He’s a clown.”
Darlene Celeste, 64, a program manager, put down her bags to speak with Salaam even though she was rushing to work because she found his perseverance inspiring.
“They were guilty without having a chance at being proven innocent,” said Celeste, who called Trump’s ad “despicable” and a form of “lynching.”
The current members of the council are serving shortened two-year terms because of redistricting. In addition to Jordan, the Democratic primary field for the Harlem seat includes Assemblywoman Inez Dickens, who formerly held it, and Assemblyman Al Taylor.

France Leads the List Of the Global Ultrarich: [Correction]

Full text: Two French business titans, Bernard Arnault of the LVMH empire and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers of L'Oréal, are named the world's wealthiest man and woman.
PARIS -- France, which has been riven lately by angry protests over income inequality, can now claim to have the world's richest man and woman: Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, the heiress of the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal.
Their combined net worth is nearly $ 300 billion, according to Forbes's latest tally.
Mr. Arnault, 74, whose worldwide domain encompasses 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton handbags, Tiffany diamond rings, Christian Dior dresses and Sephora high-end cosmetics, leaped past American technology titans with a fortune estimated at $ 211 billion as of March 10, when the Forbes figures were tallied.
Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, 69, who has led the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest women for three straight years, had an estimated net worth of $ 80.5 billion. A granddaughter of L'Oréal's founder, she is on the company's board and together with her husband makes many of the controlling decisions. Her company's international cosmetics brands include Kiehl's, Lancôme, Maybelline New York and Essie.
The eye-popping figures, which include the billionaires' personal holdings of company stocks, testify to the resilience of wealthy consumers against a cost-of-living crisis, as high earners continued to splurge on luxury goods -- especially in the wake of pandemic lockdowns. L'Oréal had global sales of over $ 38 billion last year, while LVMH had record revenue of $ 80 billion.
"More people are flocking to spending on luxury goods after having survived Covid lockdowns," said Luca Solca, chief luxury goods analyst at Bernstein. "The middle class did suffer and is hollowing out. But the wealthy were untouched, and the upper middle class is spending on all fronts."
High-flying technology companies, on the other hand, have faced a major reckoning over the past year amid a surge in interest rates, high inflation and uncertain economic conditions. Rapid growth during the pandemic has been followed by widespread layoffs, and a nearly 30 percent slump in tech shares last year cut sharply into the fortunes of Elon Musk, owner of Twitter and Tesla, and Amazon's executive chairman, Jeff Bezos. Mr. Musk slipped to second place in Forbes's rankings, with an estimated fortune of $ 180 billion, and Mr. Bezos came in third with $ 114 billion.
The Forbes rankings caused a sensation in France this week, touching off a new round of headlines about income inequality and igniting debates over whether the ultrarich have augmented their fortunes by paying too little in taxes.
The country has been gripped by strikes and increasingly violent street demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron's pension overhaul, which intends to raise the minimum age of retirement to 64 from 62. But the nationwide demonstrations -- another is scheduled for Thursday -- have also become rallying points for a broader protest over a glaring wealth divide. In France the richest 10 percent hold almost 80 percent of total wealth, according to the French statistics agency Insee.
Many of the protesters have made Mr. Arnault a main target for their ire, wielding unflattering posters and images of the multibillionaire as the symbol of a deeper problem afflicting the country.
"Mr. Arnault is seen as the embodiment of the ultrarich," said Philippe Escande, an economics columnist for the newspaper Le Monde. "But France is a country where equality -- namely 'liberté, égalité and fraternité' -- is very important, dating all the way back to the Revolution," he said. "There is a problem with money."
Coinciding with the rise in Mr. Arnault's fortunes has been a visible flexing of LVMH's muscle around central Paris: Across the city, four-story-high billboards trumpet LVMH brands. The Champs-Élysées is dominated by a massive Dior building being refurbished next to a Louis Vuitton flagship store. On Wednesday, a day ahead of new protests, the militant CGT labor union unfurled a banner atop the Arc de Triomphe, within eyeshot of Mr. Arnault's boutiques, denouncing a higher retirement age. Critics say higher taxes on the rich could bolster pension accounts and avoid the need to raise the retirement age.
Mr. Arnault has shot back, pointing out that his company hired 40,000 people globally in 2022, and invested 5 billion euros ( $ 5.5 billion) in new stores and workshops in France.
He has also been preparing to keep his empire a family affair for generations. In moves worthy of the HBO hit "Succession," Mr. Arnault has taken pains to extend his own retirement age to 80, and within the last year has placed each of his five adult children into a strategic position within the group, setting up a battle over who might ascend to his perch.
Overall, the Forbes list showed that Europe's billionaires have made their money in traditional sectors, such as luxury, retail, consumer goods, food and industrial companies. Almost none of its billionaires are technology chiefs, the bulk of those coming from the United States and China.
"In two or three years, tech is likely to be back" at the top of the list of richest earners, Mr. Escande said, reflecting the continued economic power of the United States and China.
In Europe, "we still don't have anything comparable to Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google," he noted, "even after trying for 20 years."

Digital Books You Bought, Altered Before Your Very Eyes: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Recent automatic updates to e-book editions of works by Roald Dahl, R.L. Stine and Agatha Christie are a reminder of who really owns your digital media.
Amid recent debates over several publishers' removal of potentially offensive material from the work of popular 20th-century authors -- including Roald Dahl, R.L. Stine and Agatha Christie -- is a less discussed but no less thorny question about the method of the revisions. For some e-book owners, the changes appeared as if made by a book thief in the night: quietly and with no clear evidence of a disturbance.
In Britain, Clarissa Aykroyd, a Kindle reader of Dahl's "Matilda," watched a reference to Joseph Conrad disappear. (U.S. editions of Dahl's books were unaffected.) Owners of Stine's "Goosebumps" books lost mentions of schoolgirls' "crushes" on a headmaster and a description of an overweight character with "at least six chins." Racial and ethnic slurs were snipped out of Christie's mysteries.
In each case, e-books that had been published and sold in one form were retroactively (and irrevocably) altered, highlighting what consumer rights experts say is a convention of digital publishing that customers may never notice or realize they signed up for. Buying an e-book doesn't necessarily mean it's yours.
"Nobody reads the terms of service, but these companies reserve the right to go in there and change things around," said Jason Schultz, the director of New York University's Technology Law and Policy Clinic and a co-author of "The End of Ownership."
"They make it feel similar to buying a physical book, but in reality it's 180 degrees different," he added.
Automatic e-book updates are a common feature of many popular e-book platforms, including Amazon's Kindle and Google Play. A typical update might change a book's cover art to match a new film or television adaptation, or add material in response to new developments in a story. But publishers can issue updates for any reason and generally don't identify or explain revisions. The edits to Stine's and Christie's novels came to wide attention only when they were reported this month by The Times of London and The Telegraph, years after having been pushed out to readers.
Derek Wheeler, a Kindle user in Washington who noticed last year that his e-book of Stine's "Welcome to Dead House" had been changed from the print edition, said he hadn't realized the full implications of the updates, which Amazon turns on by default. It's unclear when Scholastic, Stine's publisher, made the revisions, which advanced the story's timeline by several years, among other changes.
"It's nice if they can fix grammatical errors, but changing details that can fundamentally alter the story bothers me," he said.
Users can turn off automatic updates in their Amazon preferences. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the company said that "Publishers control the copyright for the books they publish and so control the content and updating of their Kindle books."
Google Play automatically updates e-books with no option to opt out. A representative for Google declined to comment.
Representatives for Stine and Scholastic didn't respond to requests for comment, but the author has said publicly that he was unaware of recent changes to his books.
Terry Adams, a vice president who runs paperback and digital publishing at Little, Brown and Company, whose authors include James Patterson, Evelyn Waugh and Donna Tartt, said the company regularly makes "corrections" to e-books at editors' and authors' discretion, fixing factual errors and typos, rewording phrases and adding new passages, among other changes. These edits are typically not recorded publicly, Adams said, in line with industry standards.
Representatives for other major book publishers either declined to comment about their e-book policies or didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. Penguin Random House, HarperCollins and Simon and Schuster declined to comment. Macmillan didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.
Readers of fine print have long noted the legal loophole that grants publishers vast control over content in most popular digital libraries: Customers don't technically own the content they purchase on these platforms but license it from the copyright holder. Licensing, which allows rights owners to set the terms of the use of their intellectual property, is the standard not only in sales of e-books but of movies, television shows, video games and other forms of artistic content.
Sales of many kinds of physical media, including print and disc formats, are also governed by licenses. But digital platforms allow publishers to more easily and precisely manage content than before.
"In the past there were restrictions to what you could do with media -- you could only make a certain number of copies, for example -- but there was no really effective way of policing that," said Colin Gavaghan, professor of digital futures at the University of Bristol Law School. "Now the owner can just directly control what you do with these things."
Subscription-based streaming services like Netflix and Spotify imply conditional access to libraries whose content can change. (Last year, the singers Beyoncé and Lizzo both edited songs after release to remove a word some listeners found offensive.) But the language used by many popular digital media stores can be misleading about ownership, experts said. Visitors to Amazon's Kindle store purchase books by clicking the company's familiar "buy now" button; text throughout the store -- including in the description of automatic book updates -- even declares that users "own" their books. But Kindle's terms of use make clear that content on the platform is in fact "licensed, not sold, to you by the content provider."
Media purchased through Apple's portals -- which use similar ownership language -- including books, movies, TV shows, music and video games, "may be removed" or "become unavailable for further download or access" at any time and for unspecified reasons, according to the company's terms and conditions. And Google Play's terms of service refer to "certain cases" in which the company "may remove from your device or cease providing you with access to certain content that you have purchased."
Representatives for Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
"There are streaming services out there where nobody rationally thinks that they own the movies or music they stream, but a lot of this other stuff is sold to people as if they own it," Schultz said. "If these companies are going to reserve all these rights to remove or change things at any moment, that should be something they tell you right up front in big letters, not the fine print."
Though most common in e-book publishing, post-purchase edits could be deployed for other kinds of digital media that are stored on a platform that works with content owners, experts said. In recent years, some customers have reported lost access to video content: movies or television shows that vanish after a change in copyright ownership, or that are pulled from stores for outré material, as happened in 2020 with several episodes of "30 Rock" featuring blackface. (In 2021, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit claiming that Amazon's video store was designed to "deceive, mislead and defraud consumers," for technical reasons.) But there appear to be few examples of retroactive editing to films or television shows to date.
Gavaghan, the digital futures professor, said he expects the fate of such a case will someday be decided in court.
"I've been watching for that for a while," he said. "Once the capacity is there, it's only a matter of time."

Readers Torn by Push to Revise Classics for Modern Sensibilities: [National Desk]

Full text: Agatha Christie. Roald Dahl. Ian Fleming. Classics are being reworked to remove offensive language. But some readers wonder, when does posthumous editing go too far?
The estates of several revered literary figures are altering portions of well-known works to conform to current sensibilities, stirring a heated debate among readers and the literary world over whether, and how, classics should be updated.
In Agatha Christie's novels, terms like "Oriental," "Gypsy" and "native" have been taken out, and revised versions of Ian Fleming's "James Bond" books will be scrubbed of racist and sexist phrases. Classics by Roald Dahl have been stripped of adjectives like "fat" and "ugly" along with references to characters' gender and skin color.
While some changes have been made to books published in decades past, often with little fanfare, many of the current attempts to remove offensive language are systematic and have drawn intense public scrutiny. The effort has left publishers and literary estates grappling with how to preserve an author's original intent while ensuring that their work continues to resonate -- and sell.
Finding the right balance is a delicate act: part business decision, part artful conjuring of the worldview of an author from another era in order to adapt it to the present.
"My great-grandmother would not have wanted to offend anyone," said James Prichard, Christie's great-grandson, and the chairman and chief executive of Agatha Christie Ltd. "I don't believe we need to leave what I would term offensive language in our books, because frankly all I care about is that people can enjoy Agatha Christie stories forever."
The financial and cultural stakes of the exercise are enormous. Authors like Dahl, Christie and Fleming have, together, sold billions of copies of books, and their novels have spawned lucrative film franchises. In 2021, Netflix bought the Roald Dahl Story Company, including rights for classics such as "The BFG," for a reported $ 1 billion. Leaving the works unchanged, with offensive and sometimes blatantly racist phrases throughout, could alienate new audiences and damage an author's reputation and legacy.
But altering a text carries its own risks. Critics say editing books posthumously is an affront to authors' creative autonomy and can amount to censorship, and that even a well intentioned effort to weed out bigotry can open the door to more pervasive changes.
"You want to think about the precedent that you're setting, and what would happen if someone of a different predisposition or ideology were to pick up the pen and start crossing things out," said Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive of PEN America.
Changes could also remake the literary and historical record by deleting evidence of an author's racial and cultural prejudices, and eroding literature's ability to reflect the place and time in which it was created. "Sometimes the historical value is intimately intertwined with why something is offensive," Nossel said.
Then there's the chance that readers who cherish the original works will revolt.
Fans of Dahl were outraged in February by the news that his British publisher had changed hundreds of words in his children's books. Initially reported by The Telegraph, a British newspaper, the changes were made after Dahl's estate began a review of the author's work in 2020, and hired the consultancy Inclusive Minds, which aims to promote "inclusion and accessibility in children's literature," to evaluate the books.
The backlash was immediate. Salman Rushdie called the edits "absurd censorship" and tweeted that "the Dahl estate should be ashamed." Philip Pullman told the BBC Radio 4 it would be better to let Dahl's books go out of print than change them without the author's consent. The outcry was so intense that Dahl's publisher, Puffin, announced it would keep unaltered texts in print for readers who prefer the originals.
"It's not unusual to review the language used alongside updating other details including a book's cover and page layout," Rick Behari, a spokesman for the Roald Dahl Story Company, said in a statement issued in February, adding that they sought to preserve "the irreverence and sharp-edged spirit of the original text."
The question of how to handle offensive language -- particularly racist terms and images -- in classic texts has long been an issue in children's literature. About a decade ago, an edition of "Huckleberry Finn" replaced a racial epithet with the word "slave," over concerns that such an offensive word was causing schools to stop assigning the novel. In more extreme cases, titles have been taken out of circulation. In 2007, "Tintin in the Congo," by Hergé, was removed from the children's section in libraries and bookstores over concerns about racism; the book is no longer widely available in the United States.
More recently, Dr. Seuss's estate announced that six of his books would no longer be published because they contained egregious racial and ethnic stereotypes. Among those titles was his first children's book, originally published in 1937, "And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," which included a crude caricature of an Asian man.
While older texts regularly get updated when they are reprinted, publishers and estates have in recent years begun to search literary classics more systematically to find and alter passages that might offend readers. In many cases, publishers say, the interventions involve a handful of words, and don't impact the overall story.
Some in the publishing industry see efforts to make older works more inclusive as a sign of progress, provided that the changes are made carefully, and not as a thoughtless erasure of offensive terms without accounting for more subtle and pervasive bias in a writer's worldview.
"I think it's a good practice, the same way you update textbooks," said Hannah Gómez, who oversees a team of sensitivity editors at Kevin Anderson & Associates, a company that provides cultural accuracy reads and other editorial services to authors and publishers. "The big problem is treating cultural accuracy or sensitivity as something that can be easily inserted or replaced."
Some authors, when faced with criticism over offensive passages, responded by changing their books. Dahl, in the 1970s, made changes to "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." Faced with complaints that his depiction of the factory workers as dark-skinned pygmies from Africa was racist, he changed the workers into Oompa Loompas, small people from a fictional country called Loompaland.
But when an author is no longer alive, the posthumous revision process can be more fraught.
Theo Downes-Le Guin, the son of and literary executor for Ursula Le Guin, the science fiction writer, was surprised when he got an email from a publisher late last year asking for permission to make changes to her children's series "Catwings." First published in 1988, the books follow a group of kittens who were born with wings.
At first, he was torn about whether he should approve the edits, which consisted of a handful of words across several books. "Ursula was extremely careful with her words, so a substitute is never going to have exactly the same meaning," he said in an interview.
He ultimately decided that the revisions would benefit readers. In the new editions, which will be released this fall by Simon & Schuster's Atheneum Books, a handful of words, including "lame" and "dumb," have been replaced, and a note has been added to alert readers about the update.
"A little bit of language nuance is going to be lost, but something is also gained," Downes-Le Guin said. "What we gain is the potential to not give offense."
In its recent round of revisions to some of Christie's novels -- edits that were reported earlier by The Telegraph -- the estate combed through the books to phrases that might offend readers. Prichard said he doesn't rely on sensitivity readers, but approves any changes himself, sometimes after consulting others at her estate. Most of the changes are minor, and involve blatantly bigoted language. "The words that we're removing are words that frankly I don't want to say and you don't want to print in your newspaper," he said.
More extensive changes were made to "Death on the Nile," in part because the estate issued a movie tie-in edition of the novel when a film adaptation was released last year, Prichard said. "We have new audiences coming to the market, and potentially not traditional book readers, so some of the changes we made in that were perhaps a bit more than our usual light touch," he said. Among the changes: The term "Oriental" was removed, a description of a Black servant's race was cut and references to Nubian people were taken out.
Previous posthumous revisions of Christie's work have proven worthwhile, he said. A racial epithet was dropped from the title of one of her books in the 1980s in Britain; it was renamed "And Then There Were None," and remains Christie's top selling book, Prichard said.
"If we hadn't made those changes," he said, "it would probably be completely unpublishable."

Full text: A well-meaning Apple TV+ series is the latest story to struggle with making an environmental wake-up call into good drama.
Forty years ago this November, ABC blew up Kansas City. "The Day After," the made-for-TV movie dramatizing a nuclear war and its aftermath in the heartland, drew 100 million viewers and started a national conversation.
It's not as if, decades into the Cold War, Americans had lacked material for that conversation. They had the news; they knew about Hiroshima. But there was a difference between knowing something and seeing it, even in TV-movie form.
Times change, as do existential dangers. Climate change is also a threat to the planet that demands action, but it poses different challenges for a screen drama.
One advantage "The Day After" had was right there in its title: Nuclear destruction is fast. Global warming doesn't do its damage in a single, telegenic explosion. Speed up the decades-long process of climate change and you get "The Day After Tomorrow," the 2004 film that unleashed a risible quickie apocalypse onto the screen. So how do you do justice to a slow-burn geocatastrophe while getting a general audience to pay attention?
Maybe with Meryl Streep playing a whale? Would that do the job?
That at least is the offer of "Extrapolations," an eight-part series currently in the middle of its run on Apple TV+. It isn't the first program to dramatize environmental issues. (Hands up if you remember "Ark II," the 1970s kids' series about a band of scientists, and a chimp, who explored a polluted Earth in a space-age mobile home.) But it's likely the most ambitious and star-studded.
Judged by its intentions, "Extrapolations" is unimpeachably worthy. Judged by actually watching it, it is at best an adventurous attempt to encircle an immense subject from many angles. At worst, it's the biggest work of well-meaning celebrity cringe since Gal Gadot's "Imagine" video.
If there is someone you would nominate to pull this off, it would be the screenwriter Scott Z. Burns, whose 2011 film "Contagion" was the "Day After" of pandemics -- chilling, focused and grounded in science without being buried in it.
As the creator of "Extrapolations," which covers the years 2037 to 2070, he takes a semi-anthology approach, telling self-contained stories in each episode while working a few characters into a longer arc.
The early episodes take place in a world recognizably like ours, with higher temps and bigger hurricanes. By the back half, we're in a "Black Mirror" dystopia in which the working class eat kelp and lease out memory space in their brains while the rich guzzle wine and foie gras and upload their consciousnesses to be housed in new bodies in a more temperate future.
There's a lot to cover, geographically, temporally and scientifically. "Extrapolations" puts the data first -- literally, each title sequence gives the global temperature increase by the episode's date as well as statistics about population displacement or the dollar cost of the climate crisis. But it fails in the character stories, which crumble under the weight of each installment's syllabus.
In its scope, "Extrapolations" has a lot in common with Kim Stanley Robinson's 2020 sci-fi novel "The Ministry for the Future," down to its depiction of deadly heat waves in India and its speculation about cooling the planet by geoengineering the atmosphere. ("Extrapolations" is more skeptical of that solution, with a seeming moral aversion to the idea of humanity trying to have its carbon cake and eat it too.)
Somehow, "Ministry" -- which depicts a grim but ultimately hopeful speculative future -- manages to be as analytic as a Thomas Piketty tome and as moving as a love story. It's humane but systems-focused, attentive to the importance of politics and especially markets in both ruining the climate and repairing it.
"Extrapolations" prefers to tell the stories of individuals. In 2046, a marine biologist (Sienna Miller) converses with the world's last humpback whale, through software that translates cetacean-speak into the voice of her mother (Streep). In 2059, a scientist (Edward Norton) consults the American president (Cherry Jones) on the wisdom of creating the atmospheric equivalent of a volcanic eruption to slow warming. In 2068, a squabbling married couple (Forest Whitaker and Marion Cotillard) give a party for what might be their last New Year's Eve together.
The lurches in tone -- family melodrama to political thriller to dinner-table farce -- make this feel less like a series than a short-story anthology by mismatched authors riffing on a theme. Sometimes it works; the more successful installments are the more weird and satirical ones, as when Daveed Diggs ("Hamilton") plays a rabbi trying to save his congregation in perma-flooded Miami.
But in trying to ground its personal stories in hard science, "Extrapolations" turns its characters into didactic sandwich boards. "Twenty-five years ago, we thought crypto was going to be our savior," a character declares. "Now it is killing us with the carbon footprint." After news of an earthquake, a random subway passenger says, "Sea-level change. More water, more weight on the tectonic plates." If everyday people spent this much time giving unnatural expository speeches about climate mechanics, we wouldn't need an "Extrapolations."
The show's biggest flaw may be its choice to rely on Hollywood good guys and bad guys. Climate change is ultimately about populations and systems. Some people have more power and culpability, but in an honest telling, your antagonist is partly your audience.
"Extrapolations" does nod to the broad damage done by human appetites. But it builds its long game around a single tech megacorp, whose dastardly leader (Kit Harington) is a stiff Frankenstein of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. (At one point, he plots the Earth's fate with a cabal of businessmen -- the most cartoonish capitalist heavies since the V.I.P.s in "Squid Game" -- in an actual back-room lair.)
The series does feel urgent, as if it's dumping out the writer's toolbox in search of the one implement that will cut through the noise. This kind of frustration was both spirit and subject of the regrettable parable "Don't Look Up," in which astronomers' warnings about an approaching comet were swallowed in the black hole of 24-hour media. But mistrusting your audience's complacency is not a great way to launch an engrossing story, though it can be a fantastic way to reach the sub-audience that already agrees with you.
A different way to dramatize the climate emergency is to make it part of the dismal background noise of daily life, as in fact it is. One of the most effective examples I've seen is Russell T Davies's 2019 series "Years and Years," about a Manchester, England, family in a near future of xenophobia and rising fascism. Calamities unfold in the foreground -- the financial system collapses, a family member dies in a border crossing -- and in the background the rain, fed by the climate shift, falls and falls and falls for days, weeks, months, threatening the foundation of the family home, a quiet English apocalypse.
Other sci-fi series take climate emergency as a premise. In Syfy's pulpy "The Ark," a spacecraft carries human survivors to start again somewhere far away from the ruined Earth. Global warming is the seed -- or rather the spore -- of HBO's "The Last of Us," in which rising temperatures allow the Ophiocordyceps fungus to turn human hosts into zombies. That may not pass the bar as mycology or eco-science, but remember that the pantheon of anti-nuke cinema includes not just "The Day After" but also "Godzilla."
As for "Extrapolations," it's certainly laden with noble ideas, such as "ecocide," which codifies destroying the environment as a crime akin to mass murder. But allowing your good intentions to smother your story is, at least, its own kind of misdemeanor.

Jumping on a Rom-Com Tour of South London: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Raine Allen-Miller's feature debut revives the genre with exuberant performances and a vibrant South London setting.
The director Raine Allen-Miller's debut feature, "Rye Lane," is self-assured in a way that recent, by-the-numbers rom-coms from the likes of Netflix have shied away from. Whereas some films make the mistake of equating "crowd-pleasing" with "generic," Allen-Miller brings us right into the heart of South London alongside her characters. Every detail of the film is full of specificity, even as the dreams and insecurities of its two leads are ubiquitous genre staples.
The meet-cute, however, is decidedly 2023: Dom (David Jonsson), clearly upset over a recent breakup, goes to have a private cry in a restroom stall at his friend's art gallery opening, only to realize with embarrassment that the facilities are gender-neutral. The woman who walks in on him, Yas (Vivian Oparah), tries to reassure him through the stall door to no avail, but she later recognizes Dom out on the gallery floor from his pink Converse. The twist? Dom doesn't recognize her voice.
Before long, the two are bonding over the ways their respective exes wronged them -- Dom's partner cheated on him with his best friend, and Yas's boyfriend, a pretentious sculptor, kept her treasured A Tribe Called Quest LP after she walked out on him, even though he scoffs at hip-hop. Spurred by their mutual heartbreak, Dom and Yas end up racing around London together, by foot and by moped, looking to settle the scores of their old relationships and growing closer as a result.
"Rye Lane" finds familiar footing in bespoke rom-coms of years past. There's Dom and Yas's symbolic color coordination -- his pink shoes match her shoulder bag -- that channels the red-and-blue outfit motifs found in Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch-Drunk Love." And the whole structure of the two characters walking-and-talking their way through the neighborhood is an obvious nod to Richard Linklater's "Before" trilogy. But the film also takes cues from snappier sources, like the British cult hit "Peep Show" or even Edgar Wright's "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World."
Fast-paced flashbacks and quippy dialogue -- including some true laugh-out-loud one-liners -- keep a sense of momentum that carries itself throughout the film. And Allen-Miller isn't afraid to be stylistically daring, with wide-angle lenses that follow Dom and Yas along city blocks, oddly dressed extras walking in and out of the frame, and eye-popping set designs around every corner. Yas's memory of her ex-boyfriend's apartment is very different from the real location we see later on, but both equally resemble a set dresser's playground, stuffed to the brim with detail.
Still, that liveliness wouldn't feel genuine if not for its setting. The screenwriters of "Rye Lane," Nathan Bryon and Tom Melia, have credited Allen-Miller for the film's honed-in focus on the neighborhoods of Peckham and Brixton -- it was originally going to be set in Camden Market -- that show off an eye for style mixed with the comforting. Whether it's a date at a late-night chicken shop, a neon-lit karaoke bar, a Jamaican auntie's backyard barbecue or the Peckhamplex movie theater on Rye Lane itself, the environments that Dom and Yas stumble through, and fall in love within, resemble a candy-colored interpretation of daily life in South London. This isn't the kind of film to watch for in-depth commentary on the area's rapid gentrification. But its primarily Black cast reflects who has lived in South London for decades, and Allen-Miller depicts the mix of aging residents and young artistic upstarts with the knowingness of someone who's been in the heart of the melting pot.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As Dom and Yas get to know each other over the evening, or several evenings -- the film, at a tight 82 minutes, is purposely vague about how much time lapses between scenes -- their mission to get back at lost love soon bumps up against an inevitable obstacle: being unable to move on. Setting itself apart from past British rom-coms like "Notting Hill" and "Love, Actually" (the latter of which gets a brief but memorable tribute here), "Rye Lane" isn't afraid to depict its leads as young, brash and still coming into their own. Post-breakup, Dom has moved back in with his mother, playing video games while she makes him eggs and soldiers for breakfast. Yas, who initially looks like the more mature of the two, has a rude awakening to the fact that hopping on a scooter and riding away from her problems won't make them vanish.
It's not a spoiler to say that at its conclusion, "Rye Lane" comes together as only the best rom-coms can, with one of those classic payoffs that's designed to have you cheering at the movie screen. How Allen-Miller chooses to balance those moments with the unconventional is one of the film's greatest strengths.

Outsiders Write Their Way In: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The married creators of "Yellowjackets" always had big screenwriting dreams. Their idea about witchy teen cannibals struck the right alchemy.
Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson share a marriage, a house in Los Angeles and a hit TV series that they created together. But not a computer screen, at least not when it comes to doing interviews.
"We learned pretty early that one screen is not quite enough to contain us, gesture-wise," said Nickerson, stationed in the living room. True enough, the creators of "Yellowjackets," the second season of which began streaming on Friday (and airs Sunday on Showtime), both like to talk with their hands as they discuss the dark, witty psychological horror thriller that gave them their breakthrough after years of working in writers' rooms for shows like "Narcos" and "Dispatches From Elsewhere."
They also like to share ideas, batting possibilities and pitches back and forth, exploring ideas that might have a chance of rising above the din. "One of those conversations just started around the idea of a girls' soccer team being lost in the woods," Lyle said from an upstairs room. Not a meditation on the hell of high school, or the futility of trying to outrun one's past. This is Rule No. 1 in the Lyle-Nickerson book: Character and situation come first, laying the seedbed for themes and big ideas.
"It's not like we immediately started having conversations around trauma or female friendship," Nickerson said. "We just started talking about characters and everything grew from there. At least that's my story."
"I think that's right," Lyle confirmed from her post.
Whatever the origin, the results have resonated. Showtime has already ordered a third season of "Yellowjackets" and signed the couple to an overall deal. Online discussions overflow with speculation about what might happen next or, sometimes, what the heck is going on now. The surviving members of that New Jersey high school soccer team -- whose plane crashes en route to nationals in 1996 and who resort to doing very bad things to survive -- have developed an ardent fan base.
That those bad things appear to have involved some measure of witchcraft and, as the Season 2 premiere confirmed, cannibalism, is part of the appeal. Their creators, themselves native New Jerseyans who met in 2005 and shared a dream of screenwriting, are just happy they found an idea that stuck.
"We're constantly pitching things at each other, and I feel like 80 percent of the time the other person will go, 'Huh,"' Lyle said. "And then 20 percent of the time or less, it's like, 'Ooh, save that one."'
"Yellowjackets," it seems safe to say, was an "Ooh."
Lyle, 43, and Nickerson, 44, met at a party given by a mutual friend in Jersey City. The theme was "beer Christmas": Revelers drink beer from cans and then hang the cans from the Christmas tree. (The festivities continue: The friend now lives in Long Beach, Calif.; Lyle and Nickerson's production company is called Beer Christmas.)
They had heard about each other from other mutual friends, but Nickerson was usually busy helping his father with the family fast-food stand on the Jersey Shore, serving up burgers, hot dogs and sweet sausage sandwiches. "I was free labor all summer long," he said.
They were both outsiders of sorts. Lyle was a horror movie fiend; in eighth grade she was in a band that played Liz Phair and Sebadoh covers. ("Yellowjackets" boasts a killer '90s indie-rock soundtrack.) Nickerson was a bit of a loner. "I never really found a thing or a group-level identity or a place to feel like I fit," he said. "By the end of high school, I was just ready to get out of there."
After they finally met, realized they had shared aspirations, and fell in love, they did the natural thing: moved to Los Angeles with a suitcase full of spec scripts for various TV comedies, including "30 Rock," "My Name Is Earl" and "The Office." None were made. They wrote a one-hour pilot inspired by one of their favorite shows, "Veronica Mars." Finally, their agents told them to write an original pilot and make it as weird as they wanted.
In response, they wrote a high school murder mystery. It didn't get picked up, but it helped them find their voice and generated that elusive commodity: industry buzz. Soon they were writing for the CW vampire series "The Originals," and then the Netflix cartel drama "Narcos." They were on their way.
That they broke through with a witchy story involving cannibalism makes some sense. Lyle, who has an arm tattoo of a palm-reading chart (both are into tarot cards), recalled trying to convince a video-store clerk to rent her the cult horror favorite "Dr. Giggles." She was 11. Nickerson was too freaked out by horror to give it a chance until he was older. His own mind was terror enough.
"I used to spend all day just living in fear of the night because that's when my imagination was going to run wild," he said.
There's enough fear to go around in "Yellowjackets," which, for all its sensational qualities, explores truths that resonate more broadly. As they developed the idea, the creators took long walks though Griffith Park in Los Angeles, talking about the characters and what they mean to one another. Deeper themes emerged.
"A lot of the thematics really just grew out of trying to put these people in scenarios together and looking at their relationships," Lyle said. "It just became quickly apparent that it would be really complicated, in hopefully a great way."
Complication, of course, comes standard in high school relationships, even those that don't involve witchcraft or cannibalism. Tawny Cypress, who plays the adult version of Taissa, a survivor who grows up to become a state senator, described the story as universal. Her character experiences a frightening form of dissociative identity disorder, and winds up sacrificing the family dog in a cultish ritual. But less extreme versions of life can still be terrifying.
"High school sucked for everybody," Cypress said in a video call. "Nobody came out unscathed, and we carry that around with us still. These girls had a much bigger experience, but we all are stuck with things that formed us back then."
Karyn Kusama, an executive producer on the series and an accomplished film director ("Girlfight," "Destroyer"), was even more specific.
"This idea of girls feeling they need to destroy each other in order to survive felt very emotionally familiar to me," she said in a video call. "I just thought it was an interesting thing to explore in real terms, and then allow the metaphor to be quite powerful and clean while the narrative event is extremely messy."
Season 1 hinted at the most extreme expression of that metaphor, a taboo subject that never really came to fruition: cannibalism. The pilot all but promised it, to the point that viewers might have fairly wondered: Who will be eaten? When? By whom? And is there hot sauce?
Nickerson sounded a little sheepish about what he called the first season's "lack of cannibalism." But he swore they weren't teasing. (They have since confirmed in interviews that the girls would eventually get their fill, and the Season 2 premiere gets things started when Shauna, played as a teen by Sophie Nélisse, makes a frozen snack of her dead best friend's ear.)
"It wasn't that we set out to be like, 'Well, there will be no cannibalism in the first season,"' he said. "It was more that it didn't feel like we had gotten the characters to a place where that would feel organic. We wanted viewers to be with them as much as possible to make this seem like not a salacious choice, but the only choice."
Lyle added: "I don't think people will be disappointed this season."
Lyle and Nickerson didn't quite finish each other's sentences when we spoke. But they came pretty close, glossing and elaborating on a point here, gently correcting there. It's not all fun and games when they work at home, but they appear to complement each other in productive ways.
Melanie Lynskey, who earned an Emmy nomination for her performance as Adult Shauna, said she saw a definite pattern in the couple's creative relationship.
"Ashley's so funny and so quick and kind of gathers her thoughts in a very businesslike way," she said by phone. "And Bart is more emotional; he takes a minute to get to the thing. But along the way, there are all these great stop-offs, and they're such a good team."
Cypress, a fellow New Jerseyan, was more succinct about the couple: "I [expletive] love those weirdos."

Nickerson sounded a little sheepish about what he called the first season’s “lack of cannibalism.” But he swore they weren’t teasing. (They have since confirmed in interviews that the girls would eventually get their fill, and the Season 2 premiere gets things started when Shauna, played as a teen by Sophie Nélisse, makes a frozen snack of her dead best friend’s ear.)
“It wasn’t that we set out to be like, ‘Well, there will be no cannibalism in the first season,’” he said. “It was more that it didn’t feel like we had gotten the characters to a place where that would feel organic. We wanted viewers to be with them as much as possible to make this seem like not a salacious choice, but the only choice.”
Lyle added: “I don’t think people will be disappointed this season.”
Lyle and Nickerson didn’t quite finish each other’s sentences when we spoke. But they came pretty close, glossing and elaborating on a point here, gently correcting there. It’s not all fun and games when they work at home, but they appear to complement each other in productive ways.
Melanie Lynskey, who earned an Emmy nomination for her performance as Adult Shauna, said she saw a definite pattern in the couple’s creative relationship.
“Ashley’s so funny and so quick and kind of gathers her thoughts in a very businesslike way,” she said by phone. “And Bart is more emotional; he takes a minute to get to the thing. But along the way, there are all these great stop-offs, and they’re such a good team.”
Cypress, a fellow New Jerseyan, was more succinct about the couple: “I [expletive] love those weirdos.”

Full text: Hannah Sellinger and Basil Azim met while working for a mentorship program in Texas. He then asked for a number he already had.
Hannah Shea Sellinger often got on the mic during pep rallies at Byron Nelson High School in Trophy Club, Texas, with a nod to the girls' varsity basketball team.
"She made varsity freshman year," said Basil Azim, part of the enthusiastic crowd, though he barely knew her.
They are both now 24, and he came to this country in 1999 from New Delhi when he was three months old.
They finally met officially in the summer of 2016, before senior year, at an orientation of local high school volunteers for PAL, or Peer Assistance and Leadership, a mentoring program for elementary school children.
"Hannah and I ended up next to each other in a game of musical chairs," said Mr. Azim, who messaged her that evening on Twitter, asking for their PALS coordinator's phone number, which (wink, wink) he already had.
Photos soon flew back and forth on Snapchat, usually of her after basketball practice and him after football or soccer practice.
"I wanted to be pretty chill," he said, and soon playfully asked her out using a string of a questions leading up to: "Do you like Chinese or Italian food?" She opted for Chinese food.
In early August, they had their first date at Pei Wei Asian Kitchen in Southlake, Texas, and then stopped for frozen yogurt nearby. She still teases him for not picking up the tab.
"I thought he was friend-zoning me," she said.
But her father knew best. When Mr. Azim picked her up for a movie a few days before school started, the couple said her father recently told them that he had turned to her mother and said "he's the one," and even bet a steak dinner on it with a neighbor.
On Sept. 17, three weeks into senior year, Mr. Azim showed up at her house for their date in a boxing outfit. As the theme song from "Rocky" played on his cellphone, he held up a sign.
It said: "Will you knock out homecoming with me?" He then changed into proper clothes.
That evening, after dinner at a hibachi restaurant, he also asked her to be his girlfriend, and they later hugged good night. She called him a few minutes later to say he left his red boxing belt at her house. After he returned, they had their first kiss in her front yard. (They still do something special on the 17th of every month).
At school they rooted for each other at sporting events and celebrated their prom and graduation together.
They sometimes set up a hammock big enough for two in the wooded area of Trophy Club Park, and discussed pursuing a long-distance relationship during college -- she at Furman University in South Carolina; he at the University of Texas at Dallas.

The day she left for summer basketball training at Furman, they each exchanged 30 handwritten letters, and read one a day.
"It was a new exciting, creative way to communicate," she said. They continued good, old-fashioned letter writing throughout college -- along with daily FaceTimes and virtual weekend dates streaming a Netflix show together on the now-defunct Rabbit app.
In 2018, he transferred to N.Y.U., and the next year, Ms. Sellinger, tired of basketball, transferred to Texas Christian University. Both graduated cum laude -- he with a degree in finance and information systems and she with a degree in finance and real estate.
Mr. Azim is now a project manager at Land Link Realty, his family's Dallas-based real estate development company.
Ms. Sellinger is based in Southlake as a fashion reseller, and goes by Styles With Shea on Instagram.
On July 17, 2022, while on his family trip to Vitznau, Switzerland, Mr. Azim, whisked her away for lunch, and got down on one knee by Lake Lucerne. Her parents then surprised her. During a more than four-hour train ride to Geneva the next day, the families began planning their American and Indian wedding events.
On March 7, Imam Golam Safi Khan officiated at a Nikah before 100 guests in the groom's parents' backyard in Westlake, Texas, with Indian pre-celebrations including dholkis and an ubtan.
Three days later, the couple exchanged pages of handwritten vows privately, followed by vows before 150 guests at a traditional American ceremony at the Adolphus hotel in Dallas. At their reception, a two-piano band sprinkled in a traditional Hindi song and a hora.
Two Indian celebrations followed at the Live by Loews Arlington hotel in Arlington, Texas -- a mehndi on Saturday, and a Sunday reception with about 400 guests, and a fireworks send-off.
Ms. Sellinger, who is taking the groom's name, said her father will be collecting on his steak dinner in the next few weeks.

Freedom To Pursue A New Muse: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The finalists for the 2023 Yale Drama Series Prize suddenly find themselves in Italy, with plenty of time to write, reflect and make pasta.
CASTIGLIONCELLO DEL TRINORO, Italy -- Just two weeks ago, the lives of four promising playwrights were upended: Not only did they receive an email announcing that their work had been shortlisted for the 2023 Yale Drama Series Prize, but they were also invited to participate in a monthlong residency in Tuscany, led by the American playwright Jeremy O. Harris.
Which is how those playwrights found themselves eating gourmet meals this week in a medieval village turned boutique hotel with breathtaking views of the postcard-perfect Val d'Orcia countryside. With access to a sauna and spa, as well as pasta-making classes and truffle-hunting, they are very much in a pinch-me-I-can't-believe-it's-true state.
"The first two or three days I was like, 'How am I here, this is insane,"' Rianna Simons, 21, said of working alongside "very lovely, very talented people in a crazy, beautiful environment." Simons, a Bermudian-British writer who lives in London, almost didn't come, she said, laughing, because she initially thought the email about her play "White Girls Gang" was a scam.
There are no hard and fast rules for the fellows in the program, called Substratum, which was conceived by Harris ("Slave Play," "Daddy"), a graduate of the Yale School of Drama, who judged the competition. "I just want people to write," he said in an interview this week. The finalists, who were among those who submitted about 1,700 works, are "writers doing something a little different," he said. "A little off the beaten path."
The prize went to Jesús Valles for "Bathhouse.pptx," a play exploring queer history. But because Valles, who is pursuing an M.F.A. in playwriting, was unable to leave their studies at Brown University, the slot went to Raffaella Donatich, Harris's former assistant and an "exciting emerging writer," Harris said, adding that she was invited on the strength of her pilot "Sex Act."
The other fellows, all at various stages of their careers, agreed that having the time to write without distractions -- and not having to sweat the small stuff -- was the real reward.
"There's something about having everything taken care of," said Chloë Myerson, a 32-year-old writer from London whose play "Class" was shortlisted. Being outside of her normal life felt almost like a "weird punishment," she said, "because as a writer, I'm always trying to carve out space" from the demands of work, relationships and life.
For Donatich, 26, who lives in New York, having "so much unstructured time" was forcing her "to define the reasons why I like the thing I claim to like to do."
And Asa Haynes, 27, an actor turned playwright from London who was recognized for his work "RACISM: an unfocused theater essay," said the experience was giving his imagination free rein. "Writing isn't necessarily sitting down at a table with a glass of water or a cup of tea listening to some music. It's also taking in the sun, the views, going to the spa and having a very hot sauna," he said. "Writing is actually a lot more thinking and ruminating."
This sort of pampering is exactly what Harris envisioned for the fellows participating in the residency -- the first, he hopes, of many.
The residency is sponsored by Gucci, and was conceived when Harris worked with that luxury brand. "I always remind them that the only reason they know who I am is because of the theater, and so it feels disingenuous of me to accept a paycheck without figuring out a way to bring it back to the theater somehow," he said.
Having spent time in Italy during pandemic lockdown, he decided it was the perfect place for writers to immerse themselves in an unfamiliar culture and "get the type of inspiration that can really shift an artist's brain from the consciousness of society that you're a part of to some new amalgamation of the expat brain," he said.
He was introduced to Michael L. Cioffi, the owner of Monteverdi Tuscany, the boutique property where fellows are staying. (Monteverdi is underwriting many of the on-property expenses and experiences, like the pasta-making classes.) Cioffi, a Cincinnati-based lawyer, came to Tuscany about two decades ago, and later encountered the decaying hilltop hamlet of Castiglioncello del Trinoro, about halfway between Florence and Rome.
An initial purchase became a passion project, and eventually Cioffi bought many of the hamlet's houses, transforming abandoned stables and dilapidated farmhouses into guest rooms, a restaurant and a wellness center and spa. Only a few original residents remain.
From the start, Cioffi said in a Zoom interview, he conceived of the Monteverdi as a "place to share with people, but also create a platform where people could really experience the arts in a meaningful way." He established an artist-in-residence program and a concert series; the property had already attracted the likes of Wes Anderson, who wrote "The Grand Budapest Hotel" there.
"I was like, well, it already has been like the muse has already wandered the halls there, and I want to meet her and see what she has to offer us," Harris said of the space.
The group is sharing a six-bedroom house called Muri Antichi (Ancient Walls), with en-suite bathrooms, and spacious common rooms where they've been gathering after dinner to watch movies.
Days are mostly self-structured for the fellows. Mentoring has been informal as well. Harris said he was as eager to learn "from everyone here" as he was to mentor the playwrights.
For DJ Hills, 27, whose play "Trunk Brief Jock Thong" was shortlisted, the pampering is giving them a "because you're worth it" moment. "There is so much flagellation as an artist; I need to be constantly throwing myself onto the ground for my work," Hills said, adding that time in the spa has been a gift. "I, as an artist, am worth the 30 minutes to be here."
As for Harris, he is keen to work on projects that had been put on the back burner while he basked in the success of his Tony-nominated "Slave Play" and sundry other projects which, besides modeling for Gucci, include releasing a capsule collection, producing plays, writing for television and cinema and performing in the Netflix series "Emily in Paris."
"I need to get back to my actual writing," he said, "because while it's been really exciting to support other people, I am still an artist, you know, so I need to create my art."
In the coming weeks, the fellows will encounter a range of artists (and possibly producers), including the filmmakers Pete Ohs ("Jethica") and Eliza Hittman ("Never Rarely Sometimes Always," "Beach Rats"), the playwrights Jordan Tannahill and Jasmine Lee-Jones and the author Erika J. Simpson.
Harris's experience in 2015 at MacDowell, a prestigious artists' residency program in New Hampshire, also inspired this new program. He called that residency a confidence-boosting experience that "restructured my sense of self," adding that he hoped the Tuscan experience would do the same for the fellows.
MacDowell also showed him the importance of sharing meals. "That's the only rule," he added, "dinners where you can catch up on your day, see how things have gone," and just talk.
Two recent meals were an indication of the sort of banter that takes place, with topics ranging from -- and this is just a small sampling -- playwrights contemporary and not (from Aristotle to David Ireland and plenty in between); Pier Paolo Pasolini (whose film "Theorem" they had watched the night before); K-dramas and their Shakespearean influences; British actors doing American accents (not so great, some said); Fassbinder films; the biblical king David; olive oil; Shonda Rhimes (and how she's not given enough credit for her innovations); a new stage adaptation of "Brokeback Mountain"; Michelin-starred restaurants; elaborate European film titles; and, because Monday was game night, good games to play (Spades, Exploding Kittens, Salad Bowl).
Before dinner, the fellows learned to make ravioli and picci, a local pasta. "Also theater, you know," said Harris, who had earlier described meals he'd eaten in terms of the pleasure he'd gotten from the chef's storytelling, even more than the food.
The group kneaded and rolled out the dough and joked happily.
"Jeremy's like the most wonderful fairy godmother," Hills said. "We're very fortunate to have him."

Mushroom Mania: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: As mushrooms become more prominent in nearly all spheres of modern life -- including wellness, pop culture and cuisine -- they're also becoming sought-after motifs in interior design.
Jayna Roy wanted her newborn daughter to dream of mushrooms.
Since she couldn't take her baby on foraging trips, she decided to do the next best thing: turn her nursery into a mushroom-themed, cottagecore haven. Ms. Roy designed the space to include over a dozen fungi-related items, among them crib sheets colored with mushroom dye, a felt mushroom mobile, a mushroom-shaped stained glass ornament and mushroom dresser knobs that she handmade herself.
"Mushrooms are so adaptive and diverse. They spark this sense of wonder in people, and I wanted to bring that into our home," said Ms. Roy, 31, who runs a metal design business in Eddystone, Pa. "We're so oversaturated with information all the time, and to be out in nature foraging for mushrooms, it gives you this sense of much-needed mystery, like you're looking for a mythical creature."
Mushrooms are becoming more prominent in nearly every aspect of modern life. Food, drink, fashion, medicine and interior design have all welcomed mushrooms lately -- a trend which experts attribute to increased collective knowledge about mushrooms. Even negative portrayals of mushrooms in pop culture have at times piqued interest -- like in the case of HBO's "The Last of Us" series, in which a parasitic fungal infection turns people into zombies, but instead of avoiding them after watching the show, some fans were looking up the best mushroom snacks to make for viewing parties.
In recent years, the British clothing designer Stella McCartney debuted garments made of mushroom leather, grocery stores began stocking mushroom teas and elixirs, and psilocybin (or "magic mushroom") therapy has taken off. Still, we can't get enough of them. Not only do we want mushrooms to eat and drink and wear and heal, we also want mushrooms to sit on, sleep on and adorn our homes with. Put simply, there is currently demand for (and likely, supply of) mushroom-themed anything and everything.
Mushroom-inspired interior design objects range from high-end (artisanal lamps that sell for thousands) to widely accessible ( $ 18 cocktail glasses that can be found on Amazon). The objects themselves can be fungi-related in a very literal sense, such as furniture made with mushroom leather, or more figuratively, borrowing abstract shapes or colors from the fungi.
There's been a slew of books and other media released over the past few years that explore the many facets of mushrooms, converting more people into 'shroom swooners and mycophiles. Recent examples include the anthropologist Anna Tsing's book "The Mushroom at the End of the World," which uses matsutake mushrooms as a lens to analyze capitalism; the biologist Merlin Sheldrake's New York Times best seller "Entangled Life"; Netflix's "Fantastic Fungi" documentary, which helped to popularize the idea that primates could have evolved into humans with the help of psilocybin mushrooms (the "stoned ape theory"); the electronic musician Jon Hopkins's album "Music For Psychedelic Therapy"; the late composer John Cage's recently reissued book "A Mycological Foray," which has become a coffee-table favorite; and a small magazine called Mushroom People.
"Mushrooms are having their moment across many layers of society," said Paul Stamets, one of today's most well-known mycologists, who recently had a new species of magic mushroom named after him. And perhaps, there's something innately human that draws us to mushrooms, because of their integral role in ecosystems. "Mushrooms are sort of the interface between life and death, and their sudden appearance is surprising, mysterious, arouses curiosity and invites exploration," Mr. Stamets said.
From Signs of Death to Symbols of Regeneration
On Etsy, searches for mushroom gifts have more than tripled in the last 12 months compared to the same time the previous year, according to data provided by the platform. In particular, mushroom vases, wallpaper, candles and tables have all seen a rise in search interest.
The Museum of Modern Art Design Store carries over a dozen mushroom-shaped lamps, which are some of its best-selling products, said Chay Costello, the associate director of merchandising.
One of the most iconic mushroom-resembling modern objets d'art is the Nesso lamp. Available in white or bright orange, the lamp looks like an ethereal, glowing mushroom. It was designed by Giancarlo Mattioli in 1964 and added to MoMA's collection soon after, exemplifying "the era's enthusiasm for space-age forms and materials," Ms. Costello said.
"Overall, we are seeing a resurgence in interest in the designs of the 1960s and 1970s, driven perhaps by similarities in the zeitgeist of those decades and our own current era," Ms. Costello said.
But our ancestors in the West might be confused by the current mushroom mania. In 17th-century England, it was the norm to fear mushrooms.
Because they were often found amid death and decay, mushrooms were closely associated with the end of life -- and not in the "at peace with Mother Nature" way they might be today. They were often referred to as "excrements of the earth," and fear of poisonous mushrooms was widespread.
There was a lack of scientific knowledge about mushrooms at the time, which meant they were a largely enigmatic entity with wide-ranging effects. "Some mushrooms can feed you, some can heal you, some can kill you and some can send you on a spiritual journey," Mr. Stamets said. "To have something that's so powerful and so ephemeral, it's natural to fear the unknown."
Americans held residual anxiety from those attitudes against mushrooms for years. As recently as 2014, mushroom farmers have spoken about the stigma they've had to overcome at American farmers' markets.
But the past few years have indicated a major shift. In 2022, mushroom sales in the United States increased by 16 percent compared to 2013, according to data from the Mushroom Council, the fresh mushroom industry's commodity board.
Recent legalization of psilocybin in the United States helped push fungi more into the cultural forefront. Oregon became the first state to allow psilocybin for therapeutic use in 2020. Last year, Colorado followed suit, legalizing personal use and growing for those over 21. While psilocybin remains illegal at the federal level, several cities -- including Seattle, Ann Arbor, Mich., and Oakland, Calif. -- have decriminalized it.
The influence of Asian culture has also played a major role in opening up the United States to mushrooms. In East Asian countries, including China and Japan, mushrooms have been regarded more highly, and are often viewed as symbols of rebirth and regeneration. The reishi mushroom, also referred to as the "mushroom of immortality," was revered in East Asian culture for thousands of years for its health benefits. Now, one can order a reishi cappuccino at Erewhon, the trendy health food store in Los Angeles.
A Psychedelic Experience, Minus the Drugs
Suddenly, it's as if Americans are making up for lost time with mushrooms.
It's been well-documented that the pandemic lockdown turned more people on to interior design and the importance of the home as a space to reflect their tastes and desires. That, coupled with a growing love for mushrooms, has resulted in people stuffing kitchens, bedrooms, office rooms and even bathrooms with mushroom-inspired trinkets and furniture.
Arushi Kapoor, a 26-year-old art dealer, wanted one of the bathrooms in her Los Angeles home to showcase her love for fungi.
"We're very pro psychedelic and non-psychedelic mushrooms. We love cooking with mushrooms, trying different kinds," Ms. Kapoor said. "They have a mystical sense to them, but they're also very grounding and earthy -- they give us the best of both worlds."
Ms. Kapoor's bathroom has a Matthew Ryan Herget photograph of mushrooms hanging on the wall, a bong with a glass mushroom at the bottom, a mushroom cap-shaped lighting fixture by designer Tom Dixon which makes it look like fungi are coming out of the ceiling, a psychedelic light that projects dynamic colorful rays onto the walls and other small mushroom paraphernalia.
"The whole idea of the bathroom is to give you a psychedelic experience without actually inhaling any psychedelics," Ms. Kapoor said.
Retailers and brands have taken note of the growing obsession, too.
In 2021, the millennial beauty brand Glossier opened a store in Seattle that had, as its centerpiece, an Instagram-friendly, mossy sculpture with colorful mushrooms sprouting out of it. This winter, the Standard hotel in New York's East Village opened a trippy outdoor dining garden with oversized mushroom sculptures (the prix fixe dinner menu has some fungi options, including a mushroom ragù lasagna and mushroom chili Frito pie).
For those making the mushroom goods, part of the appeal is that the common mushroom form we all know -- the pillar with a soft-edged cap -- lends itself to versatile designs. It's simple, yet iconic.
When Tessa Gourin, 28, an actress in Manhattan, spent her stimulus check on ceramics classes, she found that mushrooms were an easy shape to imitate. She made mushroom-shaped candlestick holders, which were eventually picked up by Coming Soon, a home goods store on the Lower East Side.
In 2017, Nicholas Bijan Pourfard, who just started out as a furniture designer, began making hand-thrown mushroom-shaped lamps with a ball-joint design that allows people to tilt the shade and direct light however they wish. He's since sold hundreds of the lamps, and the luxury e-commerce site Ssense now carries them. "It wasn't my first intention when the pen hit the paper to make a mushroom lamp, but once I realized that's what it was beginning to look like, my brain kept going even more towards that form and shape," said Mr. Pourfard, 31, who is based in San Diego.
Evan Collins, co-founder of the Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute, posits that the boom of mushroom décor is a counter to the minimalism that dominated the 2010s. "There's a renewed interest in the really playful, the surreal, the weird; whereas in the 2010s, it was all about being restrained and calm, like millennial pink," Mr. Collins said.
The Future Is Fungi
Mushrooms also represent the possibility of a more sustainable future.
MoMA has a mycelium brick in its collection, for which the description reads, "When used as building blocks, the resulting mycelium bricks create a structure that temporarily diverts the natural carbon cycle to produce architecture that grows out of nothing but earth and returns to nothing but earth -- with no waste, no energy, and no carbon emission." (Similar to plant roots, mycelium is the weblike structure of filaments that nourishes fungi, typically underground.)
Last year, the furniture retailer Ligne Roset announced a partnership with the biotechnology company MycoWorks to release a line of mycelium-derived furnishings.
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University have been working on pioneering a material called "MycoKnit" for architectural structures. The material has a knitted textile base, from which a mycelium composite grows atop. MycoKnit is, in a very real sense, living -- in time, visible mushrooms will eventually sprout from it.
The research team -- which includes Felecia Davis, Benay Gursoy, Ali Ghazvinian, Farzaneh Oghazian, John Pecchia and Andre West -- is currently working on constructing a full-scale pavilion using MycoKnit in Melbourne this summer.
Ms. Davis, an associate professor of architecture, said that she hopes this research can help people better understand interspecies relationships. "We live with this species that has its own life, that we are using to design with to make buildings and things," she said. "Who is this that we are building with? How might we reconsider mycelium?"

CASTIGLIONCELLO DEL TRINORO, Italy — Just two weeks ago, the lives of four promising playwrights were upended: Not only did they receive an email announcing that their work had been shortlisted for the 2023 Yale Drama Series Prize, but they were also invited to participate in a monthlong residency in Tuscany, led by American playwright Jeremy O. Harris.
Which is how those playwrights found themselves eating gourmet meals this week in a medieval village turned boutique hotel with breathtaking views of the postcard-perfect Val d’Orcia countryside. With access to a sauna and spa, as well as pasta-making classes and truffle hunting, they are very much in a pinch-me-I-can’t-believe-it’s-true state.
“The first two or three days I was like, ‘How am I here? This is insane,’” Rianna Simons, 21, said of working alongside “very lovely, very talented people in a crazy, beautiful environment.” Simons, a Bermudian British writer who lives in London, almost didn’t come, she said, laughing, because she initially thought the email about her play “White Girls Gang” was a scam.
There are no hard and fast rules for the fellows in the program, called Substratum, which was conceived by Harris (“Slave Play,” “Daddy”), a graduate of the Yale School of Drama, who judged the competition.
“I just want people to write,” he said in an interview this week. The finalists, who were among those who submitted about 1,700 works, are “writers doing something a little different,” he said. “A little off the beaten path.”
The prize went to Jesús Valles for “Bathhouse.pptx,” a play exploring queer history. But because Valles, who is pursuing a Master of Fine Arts in playwriting, was unable to leave studies at Brown University, the slot went to Raffaella Donatich, Harris’ former assistant and an “exciting emerging writer,” Harris said, adding that she was invited on the strength of her pilot “Sex Act.”
The other fellows, all at various stages of their careers, agreed that having the time to write without distractions — and not having to sweat the small stuff — was the real reward.
“There’s something about having everything taken care of,” said Chloë Myerson, a 32-year-old writer from London whose play “Class” was shortlisted. Being outside her normal life felt almost like a “weird punishment,” she said, “because as a writer, I’m always trying to carve out space” from the demands of work, relationships and life.
For Donatich, 26, who lives in New York, having “so much unstructured time” was forcing her “to define the reasons why I like the thing I claim to like to do.”
And Asa Haynes, 27, an actor turned playwright from London who was recognized for “RACISM: an unfocused theater essay,” said the experience was giving his imagination free rein.
“Writing isn’t necessarily sitting down at a table with a glass of water or a cup of tea listening to some music. It’s also taking in the sun, the views, going to the spa and having a very hot sauna,” he said. “Writing is actually a lot more thinking and ruminating.”
This sort of pampering is exactly what Harris envisioned for the fellows participating in the residency — the first, he hopes, of many.
The residency is sponsored by Gucci, the luxury brand Harris has worked with.
“I always remind them that the only reason they know who I am is because of the theater, and so it feels disingenuous of me to accept a paycheck without figuring out a way to bring it back to the theater somehow,” he said.
Having spent time in Italy during pandemic lockdown, he decided it was the perfect place for writers to immerse themselves in an unfamiliar culture and “get the type of inspiration that can really shift an artist’s brain from the consciousness of society that you’re a part of to some new amalgamation of the expat brain.”
He was introduced to Michael L. Cioffi, owner of Monteverdi Tuscany, the boutique property where the fellows are staying. (Monteverdi is underwriting many of the on-property expenses and experiences, like the pasta-making classes.) Cioffi, a Cincinnati-based lawyer, came to Tuscany about two decades ago, and later encountered the decaying hilltop hamlet of Castiglioncello del Trinoro, about halfway between Florence and Rome.
An initial purchase became a passion project, and eventually Cioffi bought many of the hamlet’s houses, transforming abandoned stables and dilapidated farmhouses into guest rooms, a restaurant and a wellness center and spa. Only a few original residents remain.
From the start, Cioffi said in a Zoom interview, he conceived of the Monteverdi as a “place to share with people but also create a platform where people could really experience the arts in a meaningful way.” He established an artist-in-residence program and a concert series; the property had already attracted the likes of Wes Anderson, who, according to hotel lore, wrote “The Grand Budapest Hotel” there.
Harris said of the space: “I was like, well, it already has been like the muse has already wandered the halls there, and I want to meet her and see what she has to offer us.”
The group is sharing a six-bedroom house called Muri Antichi (Ancient Walls) with en-suite bathrooms, and spacious common rooms where they’ve been gathering after dinner to watch movies.
Days are mostly self-structured for the fellows. Mentoring has been informal as well. Harris said he was as eager to learn “from everyone here” as he was to mentor the playwrights.
For DJ Hills, 27, whose play “Trunk Brief Jock Thong” was shortlisted, the pampering is a “because you’re worth it” moment.
“There is so much flagellation as an artist; I need to be constantly throwing myself onto the ground for my work,” Hills said, adding that time in the spa has been a gift. “I, as an artist, am worth the 30 minutes to be here.”
As for Harris, he is keen to work on projects that had been put on the back burner while he basked in the success of his Tony-nominated “Slave Play” and sundry other projects, which, besides modeling for Gucci, include releasing a capsule collection, producing plays, writing for television and cinema, and performing in the Netflix series “Emily in Paris.”
“I need to get back to my actual writing,” he said, “because while it’s been really exciting to support other people, I am still an artist, you know, so I need to create my art.”
In the coming weeks, the fellows will encounter a range of artists (and possibly producers), including filmmakers Pete Ohs (“Jethica”) and Eliza Hittman (“Never Rarely Sometimes Always,” “Beach Rats”), playwrights Jordan Tannahill and Jasmine Lee-Jones, and author Erika J. Simpson.
Harris’ experience in 2015 at MacDowell, a prestigious artists residency program in New Hampshire, also inspired this new program. He called that residency a confidence-boosting experience that “restructured my sense of self,” adding that he hoped the Tuscan experience would do the same for the fellows.
MacDowell also showed him the importance of sharing meals.
“That’s the only rule,” he added, “dinners where you can catch up on your day, see how things have gone,” and just talk.
Two recent meals were an indication of the sort of banter that takes place, with topics ranging from — and this is just a small sampling — playwrights contemporary and not (from Aristotle to David Ireland and plenty in between); Pier Paolo Pasolini (whose film “Theorem” they had watched the night before); K-dramas and their Shakespearean influences; British actors doing American accents (not so great, some said); Rainer Werner Fassbinder films; the biblical king David; olive oil; Shonda Rhimes (and how she’s not given enough credit for her innovations); a new stage adaptation of “Brokeback Mountain”; Michelin-starred restaurants; elaborate European film titles; and, because Monday was game night, good games to play (Spades, Exploding Kittens, Salad Bowl).
Before dinner, the fellows learned to make ravioli and picci, a local pasta.
“Also theater, you know,” said Harris, who had earlier described meals he’d eaten in terms of the pleasure he’d gotten from the chef’s storytelling, even more than the food.
The group kneaded and rolled out the dough and joked happily.
“Jeremy’s like the most wonderful fairy godmother,” Hills said. “We’re very fortunate to have him.”

Full text: Looking for something to do in New York? Take the kids to see "Esencial," one of several circuses in town, or discover future dance stars at Ailey II and Juilliard.
Comedy
Old Pros Show
March 24 at 9:30 p.m. at Caveat, 21A Clinton Street, Manhattan; caveat.nyc.
The roots of stand-up reach back to burlesque shows of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when raunchy jokes and risqué dance numbers shared the stage. In time, though, burlesque became less about lampooning morals and more about showing skin, and comedians moved on to opportunities provided by the inventions of radio and TV. Old Pros, a nonprofit organization seeking to destigmatize sex work, is reviving this old mélange with its showcases at Caveat, which raise funds for the group's efforts.
Hosted by Irene Merrow, a comedian and stripper, this month's event on Friday will feature burlesque performances by GiGi Holliday and Rain Supreme, and comedy from the founding director of Old Pros, Kaytlin Bailey; as well as from Elani Nichelle, Molly Gaebe and Kate Willett, whose credits include "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and "The Comedy Lineup" on Netflix. Tickets are $ 25 to attend in person or view the livestream; they are available at Eventbrite. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Rauw Alejandro
March 24 at 8 p.m. at Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn; barclayscenter.com.
Dembow rhythm has become one of the most pervasive sounds in popular music -- its instantly recognizable, syncopated thump being the foundation on which reggaeton and adjacent sounds are built. The Puerto Rican singer and producer Rauw Alejandro, a prominent figure in reggaeton, has made a career out of retooling this beat and the genre it sustains, with songs that deliver R&B smoothness and reach across electronic styles, from freestyle to jungle to hyperpop. Released late last year, Alejandro's sleek album "Saturno" typifies his freewheeling approach, its retrofuturist aesthetics driving home his aim to honor the past while searching for the future.
Alejandro is out on tour in support of "Saturno," but his performance on Friday at Barclays Center coincides with a fresh release: a joint EP with the similarly genre-busting megastar Rosalía. A handful of tickets to the show, at premium price points, are still available from the box office; a range of resale options are also on offer at SeatGeek and other marketplaces. OLIVIA HORN
Alexandre Tharaud
March 26 at 3 p.m., at Zankel Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, Manhattan; carnegiehall.org.
A few years ago, the French pianist Alexandre Tharaud declared in the "5 Minutes" series in The New York Times that he considers his profession akin to "that of a nurse who spreads ointment on wounds, soothes people, makes them forget the passing of time."
The comforting gracefulness of his playing certainly lives up to that job description. But the balmy effects of his art should not eclipse the quality of creativity that he also brings to his programming. On Sunday at Carnegie's Zankel space, he will luxuriate in the catalog of his beloved Rameau, as well as display his own transcription of the Adagietto from Mahler's Symphony No. 5. Schubert's Four Impromptus and Ravel's "Miroirs" round out the bill. The show has sold out; call the box office at 212-247-7800 for returns. SETH COLTER WALLS
Kids
'Esencial'
March 25-26 at the Fishman Space, BAM Fisher, 321 Ashland Place, Brooklyn; bam.org.
The title of this Spanish circus production means "essential," and that's what you'll see reflected in the performances. Presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of its BAMkids series, "Esencial" doesn't have the usual sparkly costumes, bombastic announcements or high-tech flourishes.
It does, however, include the enduring essentials of the genre: acrobatics, tumbling, juggling, tightrope walking and, most of all, play. To be performed on Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. (the afternoon show on Saturday is sold out), "Esencial" features the five members of the company Vaivén Circo frolicking on an endlessly manipulable set. Inspired by a toy -- the wooden stacking rainbow favored in Waldorf education classrooms -- the scenery consists of arches and pillars that the performers assemble into slides, bridges, tunnels, towers, seesaws and more. These become the stages for balancing acts, aerial feats and triumphs of gymnastics, all done with the enthusiasm of children at a playground. Tickets, which are limited, are $ 18.
But this isn't the only circus coming to town. The international touring company FL!P Circus will bring its big top to the Staten Island Mall from Friday through April 10. Information is at flipcircus.com. And Cirque Mechanics, which emphasizes the wonders of mechanical engineering, will perform "Zephyr" at the New Victory Theater in Manhattan from Friday through April 16. For more, go to newvictory.org. LAUREL GRAEBER
Dance
Ailey II
Through April 2 at the Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Manhattan; alvinailey.org.
As if New York didn't already offer an overwhelming number of performances by seasoned dancers, consider as well the many opportunities and unique thrill of discovering emerging world-class talent. Currently Ailey II, the excellent junior ensemble of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, is performing two programs -- "Poetic Motion" and "Empowered" -- over a two-week spring season that features works by Ailey, Robert Battle, William Forsythe, Andrea Miller and Francesca Harper, who is also the troupe's artistic director. "Poetic Motion" includes a premiere by Elizabeth Roxas-Dobrish, a former Ailey dancer. For showtimes and to purchase tickets, which are $ 59, go to the Ailey website.
Also this weekend, a few blocks uptown, students of the Dance Division at the renowned Juilliard School present their annual spring concert, always an engaging and eclectic display of styles and choreographers. This year's lineup offers dances by Justin Peck, Hofesh Shechter, Medhi Walerski and Camille A. Brown. Performances are on Thursday and Friday at 7:30 p.m., and on Saturday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $ 30 and available at juilliard.edu. BRIAN SCHAEFER

Full text: The biggest draw on Fox News is no longer Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it's "The Five." And daytime shows on CNN and MSNBC are outranking evening programming.
There's a new prime time in TV news: the afternoons.
The biggest draw on Fox News is not Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it's "The Five," the 5 p.m. chat show that, except for live sports and the hit drama "Yellowstone," was last year's most-watched program on all of cable TV.
In January, Ari Melber's 6 p.m. legal affairs program outranked everything else on MSNBC -- the first time in the network's 27 years that a show outside the prime-time window of 8 to 11 p.m. took top honors. On CNN, Erin Burnett at 7 p.m. and Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. drew bigger audiences than the once-peerless evening lineup.
Twenty-four-hour cable networks have long fixated on the cult of prime time, when megawatt personalities like Keith Olbermann, Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow minted loyal fans. Anchors' careers peaked when they landed a show at these most watched and most lucrative hours of the day.
Now, like almost everything else in the TV news business, that's changing. Instead of flipping on CNN at 8 p.m. for the latest on the presidency or the pandemic, viewers are dipping in before dinner and then drifting away. Mr. Melber and Nicolle Wallace, who hosts a 4 p.m. show, expanded their audiences in the past year, even as ratings for most prime-time news shows declined or stagnated.
The reasons are myriad. Without the visceral urgency of a dangerous virus -- or a sitting president who tweets erratically late into the night -- America's news obsessives may simply feel more comfortable changing the channel in the evenings rather than waiting on tenterhooks for the latest development. At the same time, prime-time stars like Ms. Maddow have moved on from their regular time slots.
"The biggest show on earth, the Trump administration, is over for now," said Mosheh Oinounou, a former "CBS Evening News" executive producer. "It's no different from traditional TV -- the plot is less interesting, and some of the characters have left the show."
Cable news is also facing its toughest competitor yet: streaming.
Americans over 65 are the core audience of 24/7 news channels, but these older viewers are increasingly turning to streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime for their entertainment. According to Nielsen, Americans over 65 watched nearly twice as many hours of streaming television in December 2022 as they did in December 2020 -- the biggest increase among any age demographic in that period.
"Unless there's something supercompelling going on in the world, prime-time viewers have so many other streaming options now to watch," said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN and a co-founder of Hang, a streaming sports platform. "There's so much more choice than there used to be. You can watch 'Top Gun: Maverick' on streaming. It's hard for the news to compete with Maverick."
For network executives, the trends have scrambled a few longstanding assumptions.
For one thing, prime-time hosts don't necessarily have to be the omnipresent cultural figures they once were -- and salaries can be adjusted downward accordingly. And the evening does not necessarily have to be reserved for reviewing the day's news. Producers can experiment with documentaries and other nonfiction programming that may draw bigger audiences.
Typically, prime-time viewers tune in by appointment, expecting to see a familiar face discuss the news of the day. But CNN said last month that it would fill its empty 9 p.m. slot with a mélange of one-off specials and occasional cameos by unorthodox hosts like the former basketball star Charles Barkley.
The network's new president, Chris Licht, has presented this strategy as bringing "fresh and unique perspectives to the news," but it's also a recognition that the appetite for current events in the evenings has waned.
CNN's 9 p.m. audiences fell after Chris Cuomo, once the network's highest-rated anchor, was fired in 2021. Last fall, Mr. Licht tried reviving the 9 p.m. slot by temporarily moving Mr. Tapper from 4 p.m. After just six weeks, and dismal ratings, Mr. Tapper returned to the afternoons, where his show, "The Lead," now regularly attracts more viewers than CNN's evening programs.
At MSNBC, the long-running 9 p.m. program "The Rachel Maddow Show" was so popular in the Trump years that it briefly lifted MSNBC's prime-time viewership above that of Fox News -- the cable news ratings king -- in the key 25-to-54 age demographic.
But MSNBC agreed last year that Ms. Maddow could reduce her hosting duties to just once a week, on Mondays. Her replacement from Tuesday to Friday, the political analyst Alex Wagner, has beaten CNN in total viewership, but her 2023 ratings are tracking about 30 percent lower than what Ms. Maddow drew in the first quarter of last year.
Ratings in January may have been affected by the breaking stories that played out during daytime hours, including the battle for the House speakership, the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and the drama over a Chinese spy balloon. Still, in February, Mr. Melber and Mr. Tapper remained virtually tied for the top-rated shows on their networks, a sign of staying power.
These trends are playing out amid a broader drop in overall viewership in cable news. In 2022, MSNBC's prime-time audience declined 21 percent from a year prior, and CNN lost 33 percent.
Fox News is an exception; its prime-time viewership fell just 2 percent from 2021 to 2022. And its afternoon showcase, "The Five," is a particular standout.
Fueled by chummy exchanges among co-hosts like Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, "The Five" leaped past Mr. Carlson last year to achieve Fox News's biggest average audience, a major shift at a network where prime time was always king. (Mr. Carlson still outranks "The Five" among adults under 50, the key demographic for advertisers.)
Even the family that controls Fox is aware that casual observers may not be fully aware of the afternoon show's success. "People will be surprised, but the No. 1 news show in America is 'The Five,"' Lachlan Murdoch, chief executive of the Fox Corporation, said at an investor conference last week. "It's a great, energetic show, a panel show that has opinions from all sides of politics."
"The Five" has also incubated two of the network's rising stars. Fox News turned to Mr. Gutfeld to lead a new 11 p.m. comedy show that has turned into a major hit. The show far outranks its strait-laced, news-focused competitors on CNN and MSNBC and routinely pulls in more viewers than comedy stalwarts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.
"The Five" isn't the only afternoon show on Fox News that has been doing well relative to its in-house competition. In February, Mr. Watters's 7 p.m. show drew more viewers than Mr. Hannity at 9 and Laura Ingraham at 10. Bret Baier's "Special Report," at 6 p.m., also attracted a bigger viewership than Ms. Ingraham.
In some ways, the shift back to afternoons and early evenings is a throwback to the traditional dinnertime network newscasts that, for generations, summarized current events for a mass audience at 6:30 p.m.
Today, the 6:30 newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC still rank among the highest-rated programs on all of broadcast and cable TV. ABC's "World News Tonight," anchored by David Muir, was the most-watched nonsports program on all of television in 31 of 52 weeks last year.
Mr. Oinounou, the former CBS producer who now runs Mo News, an independent outlet distributed on Instagram and other digital platforms, noted that a combined audience of roughly 20 million people still watched those traditional newscasts. He said cable news was simply catching up to an old trend.
"This is what we've been seeing for years," Mr. Oinounou said, laughing. "People look for a digest of news as they're about to eat dinner, and then we'll send you to more traditional entertainment -- written by TV writers as opposed to politicians in Washington."

Full text: OSLO -- For two days before this year's Holmenkollen cross-country ski races, Espen Garder took his remote meetings from a heated tent in the forest. Breaks came only for lunch and battery charging at a restaurant up the hill.
Garder, 53, had arrived early to claim a spot, not just for himself but also for the dozen Boy Scouts he leads. They would join him for the weekend, eager to sleep in the subfreezing temperatures along the five-mile racing loop.
Thousands more fans, no less excitable, would take day trips on Oslo's metro system to pack Holmenkollen's ski area for one of the world's most improbable winter sports festivals, capped by a weekend of cheering, drinking and mania for cross-country skiing, which in Norway is something like a religion.
To picture the festival's scale, and its vibe, think Scandinavian Super Bowl crossed with New York City Marathon: urban, Olympic-level competition, with spectators in wool sweaters and suspenders, campfires grilling hot dogs and enough beer and liquor for a small army.
Andrew Musgrave, a British cross-country skier who lives and trains in Norway, described it this way: "It's like a bunch of Vikings going out and getting smashed in the woods and cheering on some people floating around on planks."
Two 50-kilometer ski marathons -- one for men and this year, for the first time, one for women -- are the heart of the 10-day festival, which also includes biathlon and ski jumping competitions, plus a relay race for younger athletes. Outside the ropes, there's something for everyone else: a massive, trail-side party for college students and recent graduates; a family area for quieter camping; a box for the royal family; and for fans focused on athletic performance, a grandstand in Holmenkollen's ski stadium.
At their core, the cross-country events are celebrations of Norwegian values: hard work, persistence and tradition, according to Thor Gotaas, a folklorist whose 22 books on skiing have made him a minor Norwegian celebrity.
"It reflects the spirit of the people that survived in this country," Gotaas said in an interview at his home in Oslo, two leisurely hours interrupted only by his occasionally feeding fresh logs into a roaring fire in his wood stove. A 50-kilometer race -- just over 31 miles -- requires more than technical skill, he said. "You have to be stubborn."
While many of Holmenkollen's traditions have endured, and winners still get an audience with Norway's king, today's events are barely recognizable from the area's first ski races, which began in 1892 and took contestants as long as five and a half hours to complete.
Many of the early competitors were woodsmen who sometimes had to ski farther to get to the train to Oslo than the 30 or so miles they would race once they arrived. The most elite racers looked different then, too; even as the clock ticked, some would stop to eat steaks and recharge with a mixture of coffee and alcohol, Gotaas said.
Athletes can now cover the 50-kilometer distance in less than two hours. They stay at a luxury hotel next to the trails overlooking Oslo. And they are full-time racers, with drug testers who collect blood and urine samples at the finish and endorsement deals that put their faces on advertisements at the nearest metro stop.
The most recent change at Holmenkollen is one that many said was overdue: This year was the first in which women raced the full 50-kilometer distance, up from the 19 miles, or 30 kilometers, they had skied for decades.
The extended women's event came amid a broader debate about equalizing distances in cross-country skiing, where men still race twice as far as women in some Olympic and world championship events. The discourse has revealed a surprising level of resistance among female European skiers, some of whom have said they fear audiences will tune out if their races take too long. Other top competitors were happy to ski the extra miles. In the debut race, the Norwegians Ragnhild Gloersen Haga and Astrid Oyre Slind took the top two places.
Slind, a distance specialist, was skiing her third long race in just over a week. After a 30-kilometer competition in Slovenia the previous Saturday, she had hopped on a sponsor's plane to Sweden, slept three hours and placed fifth out of more than 2,000 women in a 55-mile race there.
"It's not a big thing," she said. "I'm kind of used to it."
The American Jessie Diggins, a three-time Olympic medalist, placed third after battling muscle cramps for half the race. She was part of a community of U.S. athletes and coaches that led a campaign to equalize distances in Oslo and elsewhere on the international circuit.
"Imagine, we didn't need to be carted off in an ambulance," Diggins said Sunday, her sarcasm as thick as the snow.
Diggins, 31, has become a favorite in Norway, where spectators pride themselves on their enthusiasm for the international field -- with the exception, perhaps, of their rivals from Sweden. One Norwegian fan club has even serenaded Diggins with a personalized song at events. (Its lyrics include: "She looks like she's a teen; she's better than the queen.")
You have to be drunk when you sing the song, Diggins said, an acknowledgment of just how much a part of Norwegian ski fandom alcohol has become.
"Norwegians don't talk to each other unless they're drinking," said Espen Antonsen, 32, who camped with a few friends along the trail over the weekend.
One year at Holmenkollen, Antonsen said, he drank with the father of an Olympic medalist, producing photographic proof.
"He was drunk and I was drunk," Antonsen said. "And it was really fun."
That proximity to athletes and their families is also a part of the Holmenkollen charm. Fans can walk across the race trail at designated points, hurl insults at Swedes from well within earshot and hand sausages, waffles and drinks across the fence to athletes who fall off the leaders' pace.
"I've had plenty of bad races in Holmenkollen where I've been off the back," Musgrave said. "So I've had my share of beer and shots." He crossed the line in 11th place Saturday, presumably free of waffles and aquavit, a Scandinavian liquor.
The festival is at its loudest and most boisterous at Frognerseteren, where the loop reaches the top of a hill at its most distant point from the stadium. Thousands of fans, mostly there to party and many of them in their 20s, fill the woods in time for the 10 a.m. start, shovel out their own seating areas and turn the course into a tunnel of noise.
For Norwegian athletes, that kind of atmosphere makes winning at Holmenkollen an achievement to rival an Olympic medal. Before the world championships were held at the venue in 2011, the Norway star Petter Northug Jr. spent years training specifically for the 50-kilometer race. When he finally won it, he found himself lacking purpose.
"Some days, I didn't get out of bed because I'd won the 50k in Oslo," Northug said in an interview. "What was there more to win?"
Holmenkollen's two-hour races, which are televised nationally, have shown enduring popularity in Norway even as organizers say they now compete with other events in the city and Netflix for the attention of both fans and the next generation of racers.
If anything, the biggest threat to the event may be Norway's dominance of cross-country skiing. In the men's race Saturday, Norwegians took the first 10 spots in the final results. Athletes and coaches on the international circuit have long said that more nations need to be vying for the podium to sustain the interest and television rights income outside Scandinavia that sustain the sport.
"We are really good in cross-country skiing," Martin Johnsrud Sundby, a Norwegian Olympian turned commentator, said after his country's dominating performances at the world championships this month. "But it's not good to be good in cross-country skiing if nobody else is good."
Events like those at Holmenkollen are what seed Norway's system with new stars. While the partying at Frognerseteren draws much of the attention, those camping and cheering on other parts of the course include children who then get hooked.
"I talk about it every day," said William Rannekleiv Kjendlie, 12, who camped this year with his father in the family area, in a tent fitted with a wood stove and animal skins.
Iver Tildheim Andersen, a 22-year-old Norwegian phenom who finished fourth Saturday, said being a part of the huge crowds at Northug's victory in 2011 persuaded him to join a ski club and start training.
"I was just chilling and eating hot dogs and having fun," Andersen said. "It was like, 'Maybe I can race in Holmenkollen one day, and experience the same stuff."'

The New Prime Time for TV News: Afternoons

There’s a new prime time in TV news: the afternoons.
The biggest draw on Fox News is not Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it’s “The Five,” the 5 p.m. chat show that, except for live sports and the hit drama “Yellowstone,” was last year’s most-watched program on all of cable TV.
In January, Ari Melber’s 6 p.m. legal affairs program outranked everything else on MSNBC — the first time in the network’s 27 years that a show outside the prime-time window of 8 to 11 p.m. took top honors. On CNN, Erin Burnett at 7 p.m. and Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. drew bigger audiences than the once-peerless evening lineup.
Twenty-four-hour cable networks have long fixated on the cult of prime time, when megawatt personalities like Keith Olbermann, Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow minted loyal fans. Anchors’ careers peaked when they landed a show at these most watched and most lucrative hours of the day.
Now, like almost everything else in the TV news business, that’s changing. Instead of flipping on CNN at 8 p.m. for the latest on the presidency or the pandemic, viewers are dipping in before dinner and then drifting away. Melber and Nicolle Wallace, who hosts a 4 p.m. show, expanded their audiences in the past year, even as ratings for most prime-time news shows declined or stagnated.
The reasons are myriad. Without the visceral urgency of a dangerous virus — or a sitting president who tweets erratically late into the night — America’s news obsessives may simply feel more comfortable changing the channel in the evenings rather than waiting on tenterhooks for the latest development. At the same time, prime-time stars like Maddow have moved on from their regular time slots.
“The biggest show on earth, the Trump administration, is over for now,” said Mosheh Oinounou, a former “CBS Evening News” executive producer. “It’s no different from traditional TV; the plot is less interesting, and some of the characters have left the show.”
Cable news is also facing its toughest competitor yet: streaming.
Americans older than 65 are the core audience of 24/7 news channels, but these older viewers are increasingly turning to streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime for their entertainment. According to Nielsen, Americans older than 65 watched nearly twice as many hours of streaming television in December 2022 as they did in December 2020 — the biggest increase among any age demographic in that period.
“Unless there’s something super compelling going on in the world, prime-time viewers have so many other streaming options now to watch,” said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN and a co-founder of Hang, a streaming sports platform. “There’s so much more choice than there used to be. You can watch ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ on streaming. It’s hard for the news to compete with Maverick.”
For network executives, the trends have scrambled a few long-standing assumptions.
For one thing, prime-time hosts don’t necessarily have to be the omnipresent cultural figures they once were — and salaries can be adjusted downward accordingly. And the evening does not necessarily have to be reserved for reviewing the day’s news. Producers can experiment with documentaries and other nonfiction programming that may draw bigger audiences.
Typically, prime-time viewers tune in by appointment, expecting to see a familiar face discuss the news of the day. But CNN said last month that it would fill its empty 9 p.m. slot with a mélange of one-off specials and occasional cameos by unorthodox hosts like former basketball star Charles Barkley.
The network’s new president, Chris Licht, has presented this strategy as bringing “fresh and unique perspectives to the news,” but it’s also a recognition that the appetite for current events in the evenings has waned.
CNN’s 9 p.m. audiences fell after Chris Cuomo, once the network’s highest-rated anchor, was fired in 2021. Last fall, Licht tried reviving the 9 p.m. slot temporarily by moving Tapper from 4 p.m. After just six weeks and dismal ratings, Tapper returned to the afternoons, where his show, “The Lead,” now regularly attracts more viewers than CNN’s evening programs.
At MSNBC, the long-running 9 p.m. program “The Rachel Maddow Show” was so popular in the Trump years that it briefly lifted MSNBC’s prime-time viewership above that of Fox News — the cable news ratings king — in the key 25-to-54 age demographic.
But MSNBC agreed last year that Maddow could reduce her hosting duties to just once a week, on Mondays. Her replacement from Tuesday to Friday, political analyst Alex Wagner, has beaten CNN in total viewership, but her 2023 ratings are tracking about 30% lower than what Maddow drew in the first quarter of last year.
Ratings in January may have been affected by the breaking stories that played out during daytime hours, including the battle for the House speakership, the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and the drama over a Chinese spy balloon. Still, in February, Melber and Tapper remained virtually tied for the top-rated shows on their networks, a sign of staying power.
These trends are playing out amid a broader drop in overall viewership in cable news. In 2022, MSNBC’s prime-time audience declined 21% from a year prior, and CNN lost 33%.
Fox News is an exception; its prime-time viewership fell just 2% from 2021 to 2022. And its afternoon showcase, “The Five,” is a particular standout.
Fueled by chummy exchanges among co-hosts like Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, “The Five” leaped past Carlson last year to achieve Fox News’ biggest average audience, a major shift at a network where prime time was always king. (Carlson still outranks “The Five” among adults younger than 50, the key demographic for advertisers.)
Even the family that controls Fox is aware that casual observers may not be fully aware of the afternoon show’s success. “People will be surprised, but the No. 1 news show in America is ‘The Five,’” Lachlan Murdoch, CEO of the Fox Corp., said at an investor conference on March 9. “It’s a great, energetic show, a panel show that has opinions from all sides of politics.”
“The Five” has also incubated two of the network’s rising stars. Fox News turned to Gutfeld to lead a new 11 p.m. comedy show that has turned into a major hit. The show far outranks its strait-laced, news-focused competitors on CNN and MSNBC and routinely pulls in more viewers than comedy stalwarts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.
“The Five” isn’t the only afternoon show on Fox News that has been doing well relative to its in-house competition. In February, Watters’ 7 p.m. show drew more viewers than Hannity at 9 and Laura Ingraham at 10. Bret Baier’s “Special Report,” at 6 p.m., also attracted a bigger viewership than Ingraham.
In some ways, the shift back to afternoons and early evenings is a throwback to the traditional dinnertime network newscasts that for generations summarized current events for a mass audience at 6:30 p.m.
Today, the 6:30 newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC still rank among the highest-rated programs on all of broadcast and cable TV. ABC’s “World News Tonight,” anchored by David Muir, was the most-watched nonsports program on all of television in 31 of 52 weeks last year.
Oinounou, the former CBS producer who now runs Mo News, an independent outlet distributed on Instagram and other digital platforms, noted that a combined audience of roughly 20 million people still watched those traditional newscasts. He said cable news was simply catching up to an old trend.
“This is what we’ve been seeing for years,” Oinounou said, laughing. “People look for a digest of news as they’re about to eat dinner, and then we’ll send you to more traditional entertainment — written by TV writers as opposed to politicians in Washington.”

Critic, Critique Thyself: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: A.O. Scott conducts his own exit interview as he moves to a new post after more than two decades of reviewing films.
Who the heck are you, anyway?
That was the first question I heard after The New York Times hired me as a film critic in the final weeks of 1999. A reporter from Variety found my home phone number and gave me a call -- the late-20th-century equivalent of sliding into my DMs.
It was a reasonable thing to ask, and the simple answer was that I was a freelance book critic and youngish father of two small children. I had seen a lot of movies -- plenty of people in those days had seen a lot of movies -- and reviewed none of them for any publication. I was almost as puzzled as the guy on the phone about my sudden career swerve, and immeasurably more frightened. How could I be vain, dumb or deluded enough to believe that this was a job I could actually do?
And now -- more than 23 years later, the middle-aged father of two grown children and the author of 2,293 published film reviews -- I'm done.
Though I continued to dabble in literary criticism during my tenure on the movie beat, I'm ready to return to it full-time, as a critic at large for The New York Times Book Review, starting as soon as I find my reading glasses and rebuild my attention span. On my way out the door, as the final credits metaphorically roll, I thought I might try at long last to answer some of the questions I've heard most frequently over the years since that phone call.
Did you always love movies?
Yes and no. I've often been infatuated by movies, but I've also frequently been frustrated, confused and enraged by them. Ambivalence isn't neutrality; it's the simultaneity of strong, opposed emotions, and I think it defines my experience as a critic. Sometimes I've hated movies; I've never been indifferent.
Movies have been part of my dream life and my worldly education since my first traumatic encounter with the flying monkeys in "The Wizard of Oz." I'm still in awe of their power (the movies, not the monkeys) -- to conjure up intense emotions, to invent new worlds and to disclose unsuspected truths about the one we inhabit.
The thing I love most about the movies is their ability to obliterate reason and abolish taste. You know the jump scare is coming, but you jump anyway. You suspect you should be offended by the joke, but you laugh helplessly in spite of yourself. Why are you crying? You don't really know, but you can't argue with tears.
It's inevitable that movies sometimes abuse their power and mistreat the people who love them most. When my kids were little -- they were my regular companions at Saturday-morning preview screenings -- I often objected to the pandering cynicism of "family-friendly" films like "The Lorax" and "Despicable Me." I also marveled at the artistry of Studio Ghibli and the sublime ingenuity of Pixar in its glory years.
Similarly, I was pleased with the first couple of "Spider-Man" pictures, impressed by "Batman Begins" and "The Dark Knight" (which my brilliant colleague and fellow chief critic Manohla Dargis reviewed) and admiring of the way George Lucas connected the mythic dots in "Revenge of the Sith." But I'm not a fan of modern fandom. This isn't only because I've been swarmed on Twitter by angry devotees of Marvel and DC and (more recently) "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Everything Everywhere All at Once." It's more that the behavior of these social media hordes represents an anti-democratic, anti-intellectual mind-set that is harmful to the cause of art and antithetical to the spirit of movies. Fan culture is rooted in conformity, obedience, group identity and mob behavior, and its rise mirrors and models the spread of intolerant, authoritarian, aggressive tendencies in our politics and our communal life.
But I will always love being at the movies: the tense anticipation in a darkening theater, the rapt attention and gasping surprise as a the story unfolds, and the tingly silence that follows the final shot, right before the cheers -- and the arguments -- start. I wouldn't miss any of the movies I've seen, even the bad ones.
How many movies do you watch in a typical week?
Looking at the review numbers, I see that they average out to around 100 movies a year, which is to say roughly two per week. That's a lot more than most people with normal jobs manage to see, but it also seems much too low.
When I started, something like 400 films a year opened in Manhattan theaters, which was the criterion for a review in The New York Times then. By the mid-2010s, that number was closer to 1,000, and with the expansion of streaming and on-demand platforms since, it has become almost impossible to calculate how many new features debut in a year. That's not even factoring in revivals and rereleases, festival films that never receive distribution, and movies from beyond the United States that never make it to our shores.
Maybe because I see so many movies, I'm morbidly aware of how many I haven't seen. Since my first day on the job I have been frantically trying to manage that deficit. Two a week? During festivals I go to four or five screenings a day. In the fall, as awards season looms, I'll start the day at 10 a.m. with an art-house treasure in a small private screening room and stagger home late from a sneak preview at a multiplex, sometimes with a morsel of Oscar bait sandwiched in at lunchtime. In the days before my Top 10 list is due, I cycle through links (or disks) in a mad scramble not to miss a masterpiece. It's impossible to see everything, and irresponsible not to try.
So let's say, conservatively, 300 a year. Slightly less than a movie a day. Seven thousand, give or take, since "My Dog Skip," which started this whole thing. Is that a lot?
How do you decide who reviews what?
Manohla and I talk on the phone every week and sort out our assignments. Sometimes it's a game of hot potato -- please don't make me review another "Ant-Man" -- but generally we follow the time-tested preschool principles of taking turns and playing fair. I'd often rather read her review than write my own; I've learned more about film and criticism from Manohla than from anyone else. And we have a squad of talented and resilient freelance reviewers to help us make sure new releases get the attention they deserve.
What is your favorite movie of all time?
The answer varies according to my mood and circumstances -- how can I pick just one? -- but most consistently it's "La Dolce Vita." I wouldn't necessarily call it the greatest movie ever. It might not even be Fellini's best movie. But I've lost count of how many times I've seen it -- for pleasure, for work, as an assignment in classes I've taught -- and there is always something I've forgotten, never noticed or remembered wrong. I still hope Marcello gets his act together, and I still don't understand why he can't.
Are there reviews you wish you could take back?
At least 2,290 of them could have been better: longer, shorter, funnier, kinder. A big part of any critic's job is to be wrong, to make an early call that is subject to correction by time, taste and public whim. But it's also the critic's duty to give an honest account of what they think in the moment.
For that reason, I hesitate to second-guess myself. I can't really take any of it back. The damage is done. My errors of fact are all there on the record, with corrections appended for everyone to see. Lapses in taste or judgment are better corrected by other people. I've kept an archive of letters, emails and tweets pointing out, not always politely, that I was off-base in my diagnosis of the overacted muddle that was "August: Osage County," in my distaste for the intellectual posturing of "Triangle of Sadness," my tepid endorsement of "Top Gun: Maverick," my hot-and-cold takes on Wes Anderson and Lars von Trier, my regard for Sofia Coppola, my affinity for the Romanian new wave and my loyalty to Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood. Let's not even mention Woody Allen.
There are times I should have been gentler -- to "Wonder Boys" and "Erin Brockovich" early on, for sure -- and occasions when my enthusiasm got the better of me. ("Match Point"? "War Horse"?) But I'd rather dodge the question and savor my occasional vindication.
In 2001 I reviewed "Freddy Got Fingered," a comedy directed by and starring the Canadian comedian Tom Green that tested nearly every imaginable boundary of decency and good taste. I thought it was great, not just because I have the sense of humor of an obnoxious adolescent -- see also "Hot Tub Time Machine," "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" and "Sausage Party" -- but also because it struck me as conceptually daring and aesthetically serious. I felt the same way about the first "Jackass" movies.
I got a lot of flak at the time, mostly from other critics, but both "Freddy" and "Jackass" have held up pretty well, and are regarded not only as crude, nasty fun, but also as interesting movies, which was the point I was trying to make all along.
On the flip side, every few years someone publishes the bold, contrarian discovery that Richard Curtis's "Love Actually" is, actually, bad. I'm just petty enough to point out that I said as much back in 2003. I didn't love "The Hangover" either.
To set the record straight: I didn't hate "The Avengers"! I wrote a mixed review that noted the imperial ambitions and creative compromises of the emerging Marvel Cinematic Universe. Samuel L. Jackson, a stalwart of that universe, tweeted that it was time for Avengers fans "to find A.O. Scott a new job. One he can ACTUALLY do." That was a dozen years ago. Better late than never.
How have the movies changed?
Gather 'round, children. When I first came to this newspaper -- when it was still, mostly, a newspaper -- the phrases "streaming platform," "cinematic universe" and "social media" were not part of the general lexicon. Films were still mostly shot and projected on film. You could still rent VHS tapes at the video store, and Netflix would send you DVDs in the mail. The American independent cinema of the previous decade was reaching a new stage of maturity, and international auteur cinema was thriving in the work of Abbas Kiarostami, the Dardenne brothers, Pedro Almodóvar, Olivier Assayas and Hou Hsiao-Hsien.
It was the worst of times! In the fall of 1999, a few months before I was hired, the critic Godfrey Cheshire of The New York Press published a long, agonized, in many ways prescient essay titled "The Death of Film, the Decay of Cinema." A few years earlier, in The New York Times Magazine, Susan Sontag had proclaimed the end of cinephilia and the "decay" of the art form that sustained it. Jean-Luc Godard, finishing his decade-long video project "Histoire(s) du Cinéma" in 1998, struck a similarly elegiac tone.
And now? I'm tempted to say that the sky is still falling, or falling again, and that it's the same old sky. The death of cinema is almost as old as cinema itself. In 1935, the German critic Rudolf Arnheim declared that film as an art form had died with the coming of sound, and that what followed the silence was mere commercial propaganda, a bastardized form he prophetically called "television." After the war, television killed movies all over again, and even when a technological villain wasn't apparent -- the VCR, the internet -- things were always bad. Frank O'Hara's poem "To the Film Industry in Crisis" appeared in 1957. Two decades later Pauline Kael asked "Why Are the Movies So Bad?" The End Times have a way of turning out to have been golden ages all along.
The current apocalypse is that streaming and Covid anxiety are conspiring to kill off moviegoing as we have known it, leaving a handful of I.P.-driven blockbusters and horror movies to keep theaters in business while we mostly sit at home bingeing docuseries, dystopias and the occasional art-film guilt trip. Am I worried? Of course I'm worried. The cultural space in which the movies I care most about have flourished seems to be shrinking. The audience necessary to sustain original and ambitious work is narcotized by algorithms or distracted by doomscrolling. The state of the movies is very bad.
But the movies themselves -- enough of them, as always -- are pretty good. It's been a pleasure to see them in your company.
A Life at the Movies, in Five Reviews
Of those 2,293 reviews I have published, here are five -- positive, negative and ambivalent, in chronological order -- that together capture something about the movies and my relationship to them over the past 23 years.
"The Gleaners and I" (Agnès Varda, 2000). From my first New York Film Festival, this was the first chance I had to write about one of the all-time greats, whose mischievous, humane spirit seems undimmed even after her death in 2019.
"Seven Pounds" (Gabriele Muccino, 2008). If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes and reviewed it with my own hands, I would have trouble believing that this midcareer Will Smith messiah movie actually exists.
"The Wolf of Wall Street" (Martin Scorsese, 2013). There may be no filmmaker who piques my ambivalence as regularly as Scorsese, and this review crystallizes both my admiration of and frustration with his work.
"Moonlight" (Barry Jenkins, 2016). One of my indelible memories is of the silence that descended on the room after the final shot of this movie -- only Jenkins's second feature! -- at the Telluride Film Festival screening. It was as if we had simultaneously discovered a new planet and found our way back home.
"Joker" (Todd Phillips, 2019). Come at me, bro.

Full text: The "Shazam!" star revives himself with sprinkle doughnuts, Frank Black's "Teenager of the Year" and daily naps.
"Shazam!," the 2019 DC Universe comic-adventure about some foster kids and their adult superhero alter egos, and its new sequel, "Shazam! Fury of the Gods," might not change the arc of Adam Brody's career exactly -- though there are perks to being in a hit.
"I've been acting for so long now but have barely set foot in any sort of big action movie," said Brody, one of the stars of the FX series "Fleishman Is in Trouble." "Being on something of this size is a thrill, just the huge setups and huge wire rigs, and you're being chased by a dragon. It's a big part of the Hollywood acting experience in the modern age that I really hadn't got to play with before."
"Fury of the Gods," opening Friday, finds the teens -- including Freddy Freeman, played by Jack Dylan Grazer, with Brody as his grown version -- fully endowed with otherworldly powers. Then the Daughters of Atlas (Helen Mirren, Lucy Liu and Rachel Zegler) show up, and they want their magic back.
But "Fury of the Gods" isn't the only action Brody has seen recently. In an upcoming remake of "The River Wild" for Netflix, he'll be occupying the same space, if not the same character, as the menace played in the 1994 original by Kevin Bacon. Brody's wife, Leighton Meester, and their friend Taran Killam join him as distrusting siblings on a raft ride to hell.
In a video call from Los Angeles, where he and Meester live with their daughter and son, Brody talked about venturing into the trenches with "Hardcore History," revering Frank Black and listening to NPR in lieu of college. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Surfing
I'm from San Diego, and a big part of the beach for me is surfing. I was obsessed with it, and from junior high and high school that was my main focus. Then I moved to L.A. to try acting, and I ditched it for well over a decade. In my early 30s, I started dipping my toe because I missed the beach environment. And surf has slowly but steadily taken over my life again. My wife has picked it up and is obsessed. I'm at this really lovely place where the two halves of my life have converged.
Doughnuts
I could eat them every day. I do enjoy this gourmet artisanal doughnut revolution that's been going on for the last decade. I don't like the chain ones -- they seem so processed and lacking some flavor. But probably my favorite, even more than the really nice gourmet ones, are those strip-mall family-owned ones, usually Vietnamese- or Cambodian-owned but not always. They tend to be a little lighter, so you can take down a couple. My eye is very drawn to sprinkles. Pretty hard for me to say no.
Dan Carlin's 'Hardcore History' Podcast
He's always like, "Now remember, I'm not a historian." I'm like, "But you are a historian. Why are you talking to me about this for 20 hours, then?" Every episode is five hours long, and one comes out every six months. "Blueprint for Armageddon" on World War I, which is the first one I listened to, blew me away.
Frank Black's 'Teenager of the Year'
This is probably the only album or musician that I loved as a teenager that I still love. It's not even that I listen to him a lot anymore, but I still revere him. It has a real irreverent, comedic and punk element to it. And he sings about so many subjects I think are great: California, space and astral planes and different dimensions, the Mariana Trench and the depths of the ocean.
Cate Le Bon
She sounds like nobody else. I find the up-tempo stuff very groovy. At the same time it's so off-kilter. There's descending notes in minor chords and drone-y saxophone. And I find her singing emotional, and yet she's Bowie-esque, distant and unknowable. Not a false note in the entire discography.
Naps
I've always been pretty talented at napping. It doesn't have to be that long, but there has to be one. I have less time to do it since I've been a parent. I'm sort of sounding scarily like my dad when I say that. I picture him asleep with a Kindle on his chest. But my favorite thing in a leisure-filled day: I'm going to start to read lying down, I'm going to close the book, take a nap, wake up and keep reading.
NPR
I didn't go to college, and I kind of consider it my alma mater. I like their breadth of coverage. It's local, it's national, it's global. I like most of the personalities on it, and I find something about their -- it's not monotone, but it's soft tones -- very reassuring. It's a calm, assured personality, giving you what I think is a well-rounded coverage. I'm sure some people would disagree, but they're wrong.
'The Crown'
These are some of the best scenes on television. You have two great actors, and a monster scene for them to do with a real beginning, middle and end. I also am a big fan of the formatting, taking the historical record and bending it to a theme and an arc versus a cliffhanger. They're really doing their own mini three-act movie in each episode.
'Avatar: The Way of Water'
I say this as someone who didn't even like the first one. But I have a retroactive appreciation for it now because I like the second one so much. I took my daughter, who's 7. I was like, "It's over three hours long, and I've heard mixed things, but let's go see, and if we want to leave, we'll leave." And I proceeded to have one of the best times I've had at the movies in decades. For starters, I cried -- we both did -- and I haven't cried at a movie since "Titanic."
'Ronia, the Robber's Daughter'
My daughter and I watched the cartoon series that Goro Miyazaki did, and then we read the book. It's a year in the life of this 9-year-old girl who lives in an abandoned fortress with her mother and her loving but volatile father and his group of robbers in medieval Renaissance times. She starts to explore the forest and then meets a boy her age. It's so in touch with nature and the cycles of life, her very first pangs of love and her growing independence. And at the end of every chapter, the writer, Astrid Lindgren, had a phrase or two that really got to me -- simple and yet emotional.

And His Second Novel Is a Blank Page: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bob Odenkirk returns to TV as an academic with a knack for talking himself into trouble.
William Henry (Hank) Devereaux Jr., played by Bob Odenkirk, is a talker. But that's redundant. Talkers are what Odenkirk does, whether he is playing a huckster on "Mr. Show," a sleazy agent on "The Larry Sanders Show," a sad sack on "I Think You Should Leave" or, memorably, the motor-mouthed Saul Goodman on "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul."
He could probably also play a stone-faced cipher who speaks only with his eyes, but that would be like Rafael Nadal switching to pickleball. He'd still be better at it than most of us, but why waste a gift?
This is not to say, however, that Odenkirk is merely repeating himself with "Lucky Hank," which begins Sunday on AMC. In this academic satire, whose wryly funny first two episodes were screened for critics, the main person his character is trying to deceive is himself.
Technically an author, with one decades-old novel on the remainder pile, Hank is languishing as a writing teacher and English department chair at the middling, underfunded (yet somehow postcard-pretty) Railton College in deepest Pennsylvania. The one place he prefers not to speak is in his classroom, to his diffident students.
But he is about to talk himself into trouble. Bartow (Jackson Kelly), a student with more confidence than talent, demands more detailed feedback on his most recent short story, which involves necrophilia and some creative interpretations of verb tense. Hank delivers his critique with both barrels: Bartow, he says, has no talent, no untapped promise -- the proof is that Bartow, like his classmates and like Hank himself, is "at this middling college in this sad, forgotten town."
This virtuosic outburst lands Hank on the bad side of his dean (Oscar Nuñez), his colleagues and Bartow's wealthy parents. But that appears to be a side he's accustomed to. Impolite candor is a pattern with him, and his dark sarcasm has become the artistic expression of his self-loathing.
What's to loathe? He's stewing in unresolved issues with his father, a renowned literary critic who hasn't called him in 15 years. His department may have its budget cut. His urinary tract is being uncooperative. And then there's the matter of his second novel, currently a blank page taunting him from his laptop screen.
Mediocrity is not popular as a subject on TV, even if it is common as an outcome. The medium is not exactly allergic to stories about the disappointments of middle-aged white guys, but it prefers to have them address these crises through meth dealing or mafia hits. "Lucky Hank" prefers to keep its crimes social and its violence literary. (There is a slapstick set-piece in which Hank's nose is mutilated by a spiral notebook.)
The showrunners, Paul Lieberstein ("The Office") and Aaron Zelman ("Silicon Valley"), adapted "Lucky Hank" from Richard Russo's 1997 novel "Straight Man." They've altered the story line, dialed back the internal monologue and built up Hank's wife, Lily (Mireille Enos), whose conflict-resolution skill as a high school principal seems to be informed by her second job managing Hank's moods. Still, in the early going, she is mostly a bemused cipher.
Unlike the 2021 Netflix series "The Chair," "Lucky Hank" does not strain to be topical about the campus culture wars. (Although the occasional use of a smartphone sets us in the present, it often feels like a Clinton-era period piece.) And unlike Noah Baumbach's adaptation of "White Noise," it's not really a sendup of academic trends or pretensions.
Instead, it's a sometimes cutting, sometimes empathetic account of the petty battles among people who have found that their career ladders are short a few rungs. Hank's railing against Railton sets off a rebellion among the members of his department, including Gracie DuBois (Suzanne Cryer), a self-published poet; Paul Rourke (Cedric Yarbrough), her snide, possibly misogynistic antagonist; and Emma Wheemer (Shannon DeVido), a film-studies teacher whom a more traditionalist colleague dismisses as "a projectionist."
None of these quick-drawn scholarly types are much competition for Hank when it comes to inhaling the narrative oxygen. Oddly, the best-realized side character in the opening episodes is a fictionalized version of the writer George Saunders (Brian Huskey), once a rising young star of Hank's vintage -- "I think I was better regarded for about 10 days," Hank says -- whose appearance for a campus event stirs Hank's feelings of failure.
Fortunately, Odenkirk (who also played an academic in the undersung "Undone") is up to the spotlight, playing up Hank's self-sabotaging bravado but finding the melancholy underneath his sarcasm. Where Saul Goodman believed he could talk himself out of anything, Hank mainly wants to talk himself through his stasis. And notwithstanding his gift of gab, Odenkirk does some of his best character work in the moments when Hank falls silent, when you can see his resentment in the thin line of his mouth beneath his fuzzy beard.
That said, if you've had enough male midlife crisis in your prestige TV, "Lucky Hank" may not have a lot to offer you, for all its low-stakes charm. Penises figure in heavily here, as metaphors, as joke material and as penises. And while there's an effort to improve on Russo's sketching of women -- I'm not sure how this could work as long-form TV otherwise -- the development of characters like Gracie is still a work-in-progress.
There is a voice, a performance and a character study here. Is there a full series? Having seen only two of the season's eight episodes, I cannot offer even a midterm grade, only some notes. "Lucky Hank" is disarmingly funny, though it feels like a draft that doesn't yet know if it needs to be a short story or a novel. Unlike Hank with his students, however, I'm willing to hope that this show might reach its potential if it applies itself.

Full text: Looking for something to do in New York? Check out Shane Torres as he tapes his first stand-up special, or take the kids to see a West African fable brought to life by puppets.
Comedy
Shane Torres
March 18 at 7 and 10 p.m. at the Sultan Room, 234 Starr Street, Brooklyn; thesultanroom.com.
Shane Torres made his national debut performing stand-up on "Conan" in 2016, but it was his follow-up appearance in 2017 that attracted a lot of notice, thanks to his defense of the restaurant owner and Food Network host Guy Fieri. For nearly the past year, Torres has continued to find the good in subjects that attract public scorn with his fellow comic Kyle Kinane on their podcast, "No Accounting for Taste."
But now it's Torres's turn to get his fair share of praise, and the larger-than-life comedian Bert Kreischer, whose fifth special, "Razzle Dazzle," premiered this week on Netflix, has taken up that task, presenting Torres for the tapings of his first hourlong stand-up special. Tickets are $ 25 and available from dice.fm. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
9m88
March 19 at 8 p.m. at Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn; musichallofwilliamsburg.com.
In her quest for an international breakthrough, the singer 9m88 (pronounced "Jo-m-Baba" because of the Mandarin words for 8 and 9) has developed a border- and genre-hopping approach to pop. Based in Taiwan, 9m88 studied jazz vocal performance at the New School, then dabbled in hip-hop and Japanese city pop on early releases. These influences and more seeped into her latest record, "9m88 Radio," a wide-ranging project that flits from samba to piano balladry and features contributions from the South Korean producer SUMIN, the Brooklyn-based rapper Oddisee and the Chinese Australian artist Rainbow Chan, among others. But 9m88 sounds most at home on breezy soul tracks, which provide an ideal stage for the buttery, fluttery vocals that flaunt her jazz training.
On Sunday, 9m88 will play Music Hall of Williamsburg, her first headlining performance in New York since before the pandemic. Tickets are $ 25 and available from AXS. OLIVIA HORN
The Cookers
Through March 18 at Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan; birdlandjazz.com.
Some jazz histories have framed the end of the 1960s as an arbitrary conclusion, portraying the decade that followed as a fallow period for the genre. Think of the Cookers -- a sturdy collective built around the tenor saxophonist Billy Harper, the trumpeter Eddie Henderson, the pianist George Cables, the bassist Cecil McBee and the drummer Billy Hart, all masterful veterans who thrived during the '70s and beyond -- as an ongoing rejoinder to this specious narrative. The group's muscular, richly orchestrated sound, fueled by the members' deep songbooks and refined by the savvy arrangements of Harper and the trumpeter-bandleader David Weiss, is arresting on record and reliably electrifying in person.
For this run, the alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw will sub for Donald Harrison, who has been part of the Cookers for 10 of its 15-plus years. Sets are at 7 and 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, and 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Tickets are $ 30 for bar seating and $ 40 for tables; they are available at the Birdland website. HANK SHTEAMER
Kids
'Baobab'
March 18-19 at the New Victory Theater, Manhattan; newvictory.org.
Children sometimes refuse to sleep, which causes difficulties for their parents. But when the sun insists on not going to bed, the crisis becomes more global.
That solar stubbornness sets off the action in Hélène Ducharme's play "Baobab," which ends its run this weekend at the New Victory Theater. Playing Saturday at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. and Sunday at 11 a.m., this production from Théâtre Motus of Canada and SÔ Company of Mali uses multiple kinds of puppetry, not to mention types of percussion, to bring a West African fable to life. As traditional instruments produce lively rhythms, four performers don colorful masks and operate towering constructions to become a crocodile, a python, a crane, a marabou, a dancing witch and a sly monkey.
But most important is Amondo, a small boy in the form of a jointed puppet. Hatched from an egg released by a majestic baobab tree, he alone can find the sun's lost heart and bring forth rain. That quest, however, involves four tasks and, as you might suspect, they're doozies.
Tickets are $ 25. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
Unspeakable: The Films of Tod Browning
March 17-26 at Film at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan; filmlinc.org.
The much-parodied "one of us, one of us" scene from 1932's "Freaks" (screening on Friday and March 25) only hints at the full perversity in the films of Tod Browning, who for a time had worked as a circus performer. For sheer strangeness, the winner in this retrospective may be 1936's "The Devil-Doll" (on Friday and March 26), starring Lionel Barrymore as an embittered escaped convict who disguises himself as an old woman and is armed with a scientific breakthrough that lets him miniaturize humans and put them under mind control.
The series also features seven of Browning's collaborations with Lon Chaney, who donned around 10 of his thousand faces just for Browning's films. (There's no sign of their famously lost "London After Midnight," alas.) See Chaney as a ventriloquist thief ("The Unholy Three," on Sunday and March 25); as Alonzo, the Armless ("The Unknown," playing on Sunday and March 24 in the longer version recently shown at MoMA's film preservation festival); and as a magician who loses his love and use of his legs and patiently plots revenge ("West of Zanzibar," on Saturday and Wednesday).

Dominique Fishback Knows You Think She’s Sweet. ‘Swarm’ May Confuse That

Full text: Enlarge this image.
LOS ANGELES — As soon as she scooched into the cramped booth of a no-frills Thai restaurant in Westwood here last week, actress Dominique Fishback did that thing she does with her eyes.
She set the tone for the rest of the dinner — warm, sincere and open — all with her eyes.
It’s a technique she wielded in the HBO series “The Deuce” (2017-19) and in the Netflix action film “Project Power” (2020), and it helped earn her critical acclaim in the 2021 film about the assassination of Fred Hampton, “Judas and the Black Messiah.” In each of those performances, she conveyed tenderness, compassion and quiet determination in the face of indignity with little more than a tearful gaze or a knowing sidelong glance.
But to take the lead in the new Amazon limited series “Swarm,” Fishback had to subvert expectations, asking her shining eyes to convey something other than their signature warmth and groundedness. This time, they needed to express bewilderment, detachment, creepiness and rage — specifically, the uncanny gaze of a serial killer.
“I’m used to being a character that’s loved or easy-to-like and, no lie, you get comfortable with that — I like that!” Fishback said between bites of crab fried rice, keeping her bouclé trench coat bundled close to keep out the chilly-for-Los Angeles night air. “But I had to get out of my own way in order to be the artist, the actor, that I came here to be.”
Created by Donald Glover and “Atlanta” writer and playwright Janine Nabers, “Swarm,” debuting on Friday, follows a disturbed young Houston woman named Dre (Fishback) who is obsessed with fictional pop icon Ni’Jah (Nirine S. Brown), fashioned after Beyoncé. After a tragic personal loss, Dre sets off on a two-year interstate spree of horrific violence, whose victims include, but aren’t limited to, Ni’Jah haters.
Glover, who had been determined to work with Fishback since seeing her play a Black Panther revolutionary in “Judas,” was as surprised as anyone when Fishback declined the initial offer to play Dre’s charismatic best friend, Marissa (which went to singer and actress Chloe Bailey).
“I was like, ‘You want to play the murderer? Uh, really ?’” Glover said by phone last week.
“She felt very sweet, like someone you wanted to take care of, but she wanted to do the opposite, which I completely understand even in my own career,” he added. “She wanted to branch out, and I was excited to allow her to do that.”
Fishback, 31, has made a life by branching out. Raised in the East New York section of Brooklyn, historically one of the poorest neighborhoods in the borough, she attended high school nearby while also taking classes at the MCC Theater in Manhattan. (A love for television seeded her interest in acting.) The drama training gave her “a taste of something other than what I grew up knowing,” she said, adding: “But I still was able to appreciate and understand my people in a certain way.”
Early on, she developed her lifelong discipline of keeping a journal, as a tool for private introspection and professional preparation. “Dom is the queen of the journal,” said Shawn Tyrell, a longtime family friend, who lived at Fishback’s home off and on throughout her childhood. “She writes everything down.” Tyrell described her as “relentlessly, fiercely inquisitive.”
“If she doesn’t understand something, she’s going to ask for that clarity,” he said. “She’s not going to just let you sidestep it, and she was always that way.”
Fishback went on to study theater arts at Pace University and landed a series of one-off TV roles in shows like “The Knick” and “The Americans.” Then David Simon cast her in his 2015 HBO miniseries, “Show Me a Hero,” in which she played a beleaguered young mother. It was Simon’s first acquaintance with the notebook.
“She prepared for the character so aggressively that I was astonished,” Simon wrote in an email. “At one point, my co-producer showed me a composition book that Dominique had filled with thoughts and questions about her character and her character’s background. I mean, this was beyond preparation.”
“It was the process of a professional, a veteran,” added Simon, who later went on to cast her in his series “The Deuce,” her first regular TV role. “She lives in the pocket of any character you write for her.”
Glover and Nabers began developing the idea for “Swarm” in 2020, while production for “Atlanta” was on pause because of the pandemic. Michael Haneke’s dark, provocative film “The Piano Teacher” had piqued Glover’s interest in creating a series that felt like an intensive character study, and he envisioned a story centering on a young female fanatic. He wanted it to “French New Wave it,” he said — shooting on film, employing long shots and encouraging improvisation — and brought the idea to Nabers, who took on the role of showrunner, writing the pilot and several subsequent episodes. Glover directed the pilot.
Nabers expanded the narrative partly by tapping into her own family history. During a phone interview last week, she explained how, at age 20, she learned of a bygone grandfather who had committed a murder, changed his identity and fled to Pennsylvania, finally dying as a wanted man. As she began writing, she pondered: “How does someone Black get away with murder? How does that even happen? How does that person then reinvent themselves?”
“And you see Dre do that in every single episode,” she said.
Dre’s obsession with Ni’Jah — and her self-assigned mission to punish all detractors — is a clear, if exaggerated, reference to the BeyHive, as Beyoncé’s most devoted fans call themselves. “This is not a work of fiction,” announce the cheeky title cards at the beginning of each episode. (It is indeed a work of fiction.) “Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is intentional.”
The creators could have nodded to any number of notoriously hive-minded and aggressive fan bases — Taylor Swift’s Swifties, Nicki Minaj’s Barbz — but Glover said they picked the BeyHive because Beyoncé and her fans are so culturally pervasive.
“Garth Brooks has a gigantic fan base — might in some ways be bigger than Beyoncé’s — but you’re not wearing what Garth Brooks is wearing right now,” he said. Beyoncé’s fandom, he added, is “the most interesting and the most fun, honestly, and it has had the biggest impact.”
Fishback had long wanted to take on a character as dark as Charlize Theron’s in “Monster,” she said, though Dre’s psychology felt particularly uncharted. She had grown up loving the Jackson 5, the Temptations, Aaliyah, Lauryn Hill and Eminem, but never any of them to a frenzied degree. (Still, the Eminem song “Stan,” which coined the term for a super obsessive fan? “I could rap to you the whole last verse, the real crazy verse,” she said. “The whole thing, I know it by heart.”)
She admitted she didn’t feel in sync with Dre at first. “I really didn’t know who she was or what she physically was going to be like, so I just tried things,” she said. Early directives were few. “The only thing they really gave me was that she was emotionally stunted,” she added. Even her trusty journal didn’t help. She had to improvise.
“I didn’t journal as her at all,” she said of Dre. “There was no way to connect the things that she thought or said.”
That sense that she was fumbling in the dark was by design. “She would ask me questions like, “Why is she doing this?’” Glover said of directing her. “And I felt bad because I was like, ‘If I just tell you, it’s going to work a little less. I need you to be searching in the shots.’”
“She allowed herself to be afraid” of what Dre was capable of, he added, “which I was really thankful for.”
Fishback seemed surprised with what she ultimately found inside herself. “I didn’t think I was this brave, no sirree,” she said. “I’m from Brooklyn, I’m an Aries and all that stuff, but I’m very, very sensitive.”
She has yet to fully find her bearings in Los Angeles, having moved here in 2021 — her production schedule has kept her busy, and she doesn’t know how to drive. Anyway, “I like to spend my days in solitude,” she said, filling her down time with weekly guitar lessons, playing piano, writing poetry and reading (currently, the dating advice book “Calling in ‘The One’”).
“Swarm” seems bound to generate chatter, though, potentially raising her public profile. Is she worried about pushback from the stans, from the real-life BeyHive?
“I don’t manifest that,” she said, casually taking a sip of her lemonade (yes, really). “They’re going to love me.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

There’s a new prime time in TV news: the afternoons.
The biggest draw on Fox News is not Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity; it’s “The Five,” the 5 p.m. chat show that, except for live sports and the hit drama “Yellowstone,” was last year’s most-watched program on all of cable TV.
In January, Ari Melber’s 6 p.m. legal affairs program outranked everything else on MSNBC — the first time in the network’s 27 years that a show outside the prime-time window of 8 to 11 p.m. took top honors. On CNN, Erin Burnett at 7 p.m. and Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. drew bigger audiences than the once-peerless evening lineup.
Twenty-four-hour cable networks have long fixated on the cult of prime time, when megawatt personalities like Keith Olbermann, Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow minted loyal fans. Anchors’ careers peaked when they landed a show at these most watched and most lucrative hours of the day.
Now, like almost everything else in the TV news business, that’s changing. Instead of flipping on CNN at 8 p.m. for the latest on the presidency or the pandemic, viewers are dipping in before dinner and then drifting away. Melber and Nicolle Wallace, who hosts a 4 p.m. show, expanded their audiences in the past year, even as ratings for most prime-time news shows declined or stagnated.
The reasons are myriad. Without the visceral urgency of a dangerous virus — or a sitting president who tweets erratically late into the night — America’s news obsessives may simply feel more comfortable changing the channel in the evenings rather than waiting on tenterhooks for the latest development. At the same time, prime-time stars like Maddow have moved on from their regular time slots.
“The biggest show on earth, the Trump administration, is over for now,” said Mosheh Oinounou, a former “CBS Evening News” executive producer. “It’s no different from traditional TV; the plot is less interesting, and some of the characters have left the show.”
Cable news is also facing its toughest competitor yet: streaming.
Americans older than 65 are the core audience of 24/7 news channels, but these older viewers are increasingly turning to streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime for their entertainment. According to Nielsen, Americans older than 65 watched nearly twice as many hours of streaming television in December 2022 as they did in December 2020 — the biggest increase among any age demographic in that period.
“Unless there’s something super compelling going on in the world, prime-time viewers have so many other streaming options now to watch,” said Jonathan Klein, a former president of CNN and a co-founder of Hang, a streaming sports platform. “There’s so much more choice than there used to be. You can watch ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ on streaming. It’s hard for the news to compete with Maverick.”
For network executives, the trends have scrambled a few long-standing assumptions.
For one thing, prime-time hosts don’t necessarily have to be the omnipresent cultural figures they once were — and salaries can be adjusted downward accordingly. And the evening does not necessarily have to be reserved for reviewing the day’s news. Producers can experiment with documentaries and other nonfiction programming that may draw bigger audiences.
Typically, prime-time viewers tune in by appointment, expecting to see a familiar face discuss the news of the day. But CNN said last month that it would fill its empty 9 p.m. slot with a mélange of one-off specials and occasional cameos by unorthodox hosts like former basketball star Charles Barkley.
The network’s new president, Chris Licht, has presented this strategy as bringing “fresh and unique perspectives to the news,” but it’s also a recognition that the appetite for current events in the evenings has waned.
CNN’s 9 p.m. audiences fell after Chris Cuomo, once the network’s highest-rated anchor, was fired in 2021. Last fall, Licht tried reviving the 9 p.m. slot by moving Tapper from 4 p.m. After just six weeks and dismal ratings, Tapper returned to the afternoons, where his show, “The Lead,” now regularly attracts more viewers than CNN’s evening programs.
At MSNBC, the long-running 9 p.m. program “The Rachel Maddow Show” was so popular in the Trump years that it briefly lifted MSNBC’s prime-time viewership above that of Fox News — the cable news ratings king — in the key 25-to-54 age demographic.
But MSNBC agreed last year that Maddow could reduce her hosting duties to just once a week, on Mondays. Her replacement from Tuesday to Friday, political analyst Alex Wagner, has struggled to build an audience. Her ratings in 2023 are tracking about 30% lower than what Maddow drew in the first quarter of last year.
Ratings in January may have been affected by the breaking stories that played out during daytime hours, including the battle for the House speakership, the Alex Murdaugh murder trial and the drama over a Chinese spy balloon. Still, in February, Melber and Tapper remained virtually tied for the top-rated shows on their networks, a sign of staying power.
These trends are playing out amid a broader drop in overall viewership in cable news. In 2022, MSNBC’s prime-time audience declined 21% from a year prior, and CNN lost 33%.
Fox News is an exception; its prime-time viewership fell just 2% from 2021 to 2022. And its afternoon showcase, “The Five,” is a particular standout.
Fueled by chummy exchanges among co-hosts like Jesse Watters and Greg Gutfeld, “The Five” leaped past Carlson last year to achieve Fox News’ biggest average audience, a major shift at a network where prime time was always king. (Carlson still outranks “The Five” among adults younger than 50, the key demographic for advertisers.)
Even the family that controls Fox is aware that casual observers may not be fully aware of the afternoon show’s success. “People will be surprised, but the No. 1 news show in America is ‘The Five,’” Lachlan Murdoch, CEO of the Fox Corp., said at an investor conference last week. “It’s a great, energetic show, a panel show that has opinions from all sides of politics.”
“The Five” has also incubated two of the network’s rising stars. Fox News turned to Gutfeld to lead a new 11 p.m. comedy show that has turned into a major hit. The show far outranks its straight-laced, news-focused competitors on CNN and MSNBC and routinely pulls in more viewers than comedy stalwarts like Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon.
“The Five” isn’t the only afternoon show on Fox News that has been doing well relative to its in-house competition. In February, Watters’ 7 p.m. show drew more viewers than Hannity at 9 and Laura Ingraham at 10. Bret Baier’s “Special Report,” at 6 p.m., also attracted a bigger viewership than Ingraham.
In some ways, the shift back to afternoons and early evenings is a throwback to the traditional dinnertime network newscasts that for generations summarized current events for a mass audience at 6:30 p.m.
Today, the 6:30 newscasts on ABC, CBS and NBC still rank among the highest-rated programs on all of broadcast and cable TV. ABC’s “World News Tonight,” anchored by David Muir, was the most-watched nonsports program on all of television in 31 of 52 weeks last year.
Oinounou, the former CBS producer who now runs Mo News, an independent outlet distributed on Instagram and other digital platforms, noted that a combined audience of roughly 20 million people still watched those traditional newscasts. He said cable news was simply catching up to an old trend.
“This is what we’ve been seeing for years,” Oinounou said, laughing. “People look for a digest of news as they’re about to eat dinner, and then we’ll send you to more traditional entertainment — written by TV writers as opposed to politicians in Washington.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Don't get her wrong. Laverne Cox loves Joan Rivers.
"Joan is for me the originator of everything," Ms. Cox said. The comedian, who died in 2014, was the first host of "Live From the Red Carpet," now called "Live From E!," and perhaps the best-known red carpet commentator in history.
Ms. Rivers could bite with the strength of a diamond-collared toy poodle, drawing blood that only sometimes splashed back on her. She'd scream and curse and fire off jokes about celebrities' bodies and outfits. There was scorched earth all over the trails she blazed.
"But I'm not Joan, there's only one Joan, and the times are very different, too," said Ms. Cox, 50, wrestling with whether she wanted to use the phrase "political correctness," or if that was too dated. "It would be a tricky time for Joan."
Ms. Cox, the current star of E!'s red carpet show, doesn't bite like that. She considers herself a nerd, particularly when it comes to the craft of acting -- casually citing Chekhov in conversation, and once reciting a Macbeth monologue on air, egged on by Denzel Washington, while producers urged her to wrap it up.
She skews more "fan girl" (her words) than "Fashion Police," the former E! talk show with segments including "starlet or streetwalker." Ms. Cox did make appearances as both a "Fashion Police" guest and subject. Giuliana Rancic, who preceded Ms. Cox as the network's red carpet host, once praised her during a Screen Actors Guild Awards recap. "I love Laverne Cox," she said, "and I don't want to say anything bad." Then she called her dress "hideous."
Generally, the red carpet no longer nurtures this kind of discourse. There has been a shift, over the last decade, from seeing famous people as wealthy elites deserving of mockery to just-like-us humans deserving of compassion. E! hiring Ms. Cox, whose first show as host was in December 2021, seems to be part of this shift.
"We were looking for a fresh voice and fresh perspective, particularly somebody who could be both a Hollywood insider and a fan," said Cassandra Tryon, the senior vice president for live events for NBCUniversal television and streaming (NBCUniversal owns E!). "It's like moving from a journalistic interview to a host of a party, and everybody wants to talk to the host."
The strategy, according to the network, has been working. While awards shows have struggled with viewership, the Grammy Awards' live carpet telecast in February drew about 1.1 million viewers -- the most for any E! program since 2020 (surpassing a season premiere episode of "Keeping Up With the Kardashians").
"It is a craft too, by the way, to be a host," Ms. Tryon said, sitting in a room at the Hollywood Roosevelt, where the courtyard becomes an E! set during the Oscars. It was the eve of what she called the network's Super Bowl.
Oh, the humanity.
"I feel nervous," Ms. Cox said toward the end of rehearsals late Saturday afternoon. Outside of the Dolby Theatre, plastic still covered the champagne-colored carpet and mummified a jumbo Oscars statue facing the E! cameras.
She had spent five hours on Friday reviewing and reworking questions for the nominees and presenters. There was a thick stack of cue cards for every name -- some confirmed to stop and speak to Ms. Cox on the carpet, others more wishful. ("We always prep Cate" -- Blanchett, that is -- "and she never stops," Ms. Cox bemoaned to her producers.) A card could have four questions, but once cameras start rolling, only one or two may make it to air.
The Oscars carpet is a particularly overstuffed carpet; E! doesn't get a platform here, unlike at some other ceremonies. Which means there is a steady torrent of people -- attendees, staff, photographers, publicists, assistants -- jostling behind Ms. Cox as she works.
Her interviews must be quick, to maximize the number of high-profile guests featured during E!'s three-hour broadcast, which jumps between Ms. Cox's carpet interviews and a group of commentators at the Hollywood Roosevelt, or stationed on a nearby rooftop.
Ms. Cox has an earpiece and at least two people cuing her on-site: a stage manager and a supervising producer named Sam Bellikoff, the creator of the cue cards and master of pronunciations ("Ana de Armas," "Banshees of Inisherin"), who sometimes sits at Ms. Cox's feet, tapping her leg. (One piece of E! interviewing wisdom imparted by Ms. Tryon: Skip asking people how they're feeling, since everyone asks that, and the answers are often generic.)
In explaining what she's trying to accomplish as a host, Ms. Cox pointed to a Grammys interview with Machine Gun Kelly, in which he admitted to lacking "self-love," in the context of losing awards. Ms. Cox told him: "Ultimately, there's nothing outside of us that can make us love ourselves more. It has to come from inside."
That moment epitomized her desire to "create space for people to come and be themselves," she said. "It can be frivolous. It can be silly." She has no problem screaming as if she's about to faint, casually asking her co-hosts for "tea" or referring to her interview subjects as just "girl."
"But it can also be deep," she said. "What does it mean to be human?"
Speaking to Questlove on Sunday about his next documentary -- about Sly and the Family Stone and mental health in the Black community -- Ms. Cox cited the phrase "post-traumatic slave syndrome," coined by Joy DeGruy. "Where was the mental health after emancipation?" Ms. Cox said. Later in the show, she asked the director Sarah Polley about Rooney Mara's use of a fart machine on the set of "Women Talking." She whips between nuance and nuttiness.
"In doing this job, I feel like the public has gotten to see a different side of me," said Ms. Cox, who is best known for her role on "Orange Is the New Black," which was on Netflix from 2013 to 2019, and earned her four Emmy nominations and two SAG ensemble acting awards. "It's been a different way for me, hopefully, to highlight people's humanity. As an artist, we're arbiters of empathy and humanity. And I think it's possible as a red-carpet host to also do that."
Yet it's harder to do that in 60-second increments, in the heat of a celebrity battle zone, dodging Molotov cocktails of opulence and Ozempic.
Speaking by phone on Monday, Ms. Cox said she felt "off" during the previous night's broadcast, during which she completed 31 interviews (according to E!). She had some trouble breathing comfortably after choosing a particularly tight corset to wear with her Vera Wang gown ("ethereal Blade Runner," she called the sea-foam-and-black look), and she noticed the Oscars guests seemed more weary, compared with their excitement at the start of the awards season.
"I think I was frustrated with wanting to have deeper interactions and having so little time," she said. "I'm always looking for connection. I'm always looking for something that feels authentic and unexpected.
"There's never enough time."
'What story are you telling us with this look tonight?'
If there's one thing alone that will define Ms. Cox's tenure as a red carpet host, it's the way she has retooled the question "Who are you wearing tonight?"
Backlash to that question began to swell in 2015, when celebrities including Reese Witherspoon drew attention to a campaign called #AskHerMore. After the #MeToo movement took off in late 2017, there was a call for interviewers, including Ms. Rancic and Ryan Seacrest on E!, to ask more substantive questions too.
Yet Ms. Cox, a fashion enthusiast -- she wore a vintage Mugler suit to her rehearsal Saturday -- had no intention of eliminating the discussion of fashion. After she took over the hosting job, she asked attendees: "What story are you trying to tell with your look tonight?"
The quality of answers vary. Sometimes they're funny or thoughtful, and sometimes, as Austin Butler said of his Saint Laurent suit on Sunday night: "I don't know what story I'm telling you. I just thought it was a beautiful tuxedo." That's fine with Ms. Cox, too. "The question for me is just an invitation to think differently about what we put on our backs," she said.
It is a question that has been applauded by the Representation Project, the organization behind the #AskHerMore campaign: "The way that she is approaching questions about fashion is a layer I've never seen on the red carpet," said Caroline Heldman, the executive director. Ms. Heldman added that there is still work to be done. The Representation Project tracked four hours of red carpet coverage on Sunday night -- two on ABC and two on E! -- and found that women were still twice as likely as men to be asked about what they were wearing.
But the question is also rooted in Ms. Cox's experience as a transgender woman. "My own relationship to fashion has always been an attempt to communicate to the world who I am," she said. "Pre-transition, there was someone inside that was not reflected on the outside."
Generally, though, Ms. Cox said she appreciates that her identity and activism aren't at the forefront of her hosting role: "What I do love about my job at E! is that, particularly as a host, I'm openly trans, but it's not about me being trans."
Last month, at the Grammys, Ms. Cox was approached by Dylan Mulvaney, a TikTok creator who has been documenting her own transition, and who wanted to make a video with Ms. Cox. In the clip, Ms. Cox cautioned Ms. Mulvaney to "make sure you keep things to yourself -- everything cannot be the public."
It was classic advice from Ms. Cox, who considers herself a private person. She referred to "having a cry" recently over not spending much time with her boyfriend, though when she was pressed for more details, she said she was "trying to keep him off the radar."
Ms. Tryon said E! considers Ms. Cox's activism "as a plus" that gives her "a unique connection to celebrities." That connection is the priority, Ms. Tryon said, along with "how to make it fun and light and safe for Laverne's guests."
Ms. Cox said the only hesitation she had before taking the hosting job was whether it would make people in the industry, and in the public more widely, "forget that I'm also an actor," she said. She is less worried about that now. Next week, she'll travel to Georgia to begin work on a sitcom produced by Norman Lear. Her contract with E! runs through the end of 2023.
But her appreciation for acting is not something that many in her E! audience -- those watching the long hours of rapid interviews -- are likely to forget. Often her questions and comments touch on the preparation and physicality and history of acting. She once got a note from her producers that said the audience didn't like these craft questions, she said. It didn't stop her.
"I'm an actress," she said. "I'm obsessed with craft."

LOS ANGELES — Don’t get her wrong. Laverne Cox loves Joan Rivers.
“Joan is for me the originator of everything,” Cox said. The comedian, who died in 2014, was the first host of “Live From the Red Carpet,” now called “Live From E!,” and perhaps the best-known red carpet commentator in history.
Rivers could bite with the strength of a diamond-collared toy poodle, drawing blood that only sometimes splashed back on her. She’d scream and curse and fire off jokes about celebrities’ bodies and outfits. There was scorched earth all over the trails she blazed.
“But I’m not Joan, there’s only one Joan, and the times are very different, too,” said Cox, 50, wrestling with whether she wanted to use the phrase “political correctness,” or if that was too dated. “It would be a tricky time for Joan.”
Cox, the current star of E!’s red carpet show, doesn’t bite like that. She considers herself a nerd, particularly when it comes to the craft of acting — casually citing Chekhov in conversation, and once reciting a Macbeth monologue on air, egged on by Denzel Washington, while producers urged her to wrap it up.
She skews more “fan girl” (her words) than “Fashion Police,” the former E! talk show with segments including “starlet or streetwalker.” Cox did make appearances as both a “Fashion Police” guest and subject. Giuliana Rancic, who preceded Cox as the network’s red carpet host, once praised her during a Screen Actors Guild Awards recap. “I love Laverne Cox,” she said, “and I don’t want to say anything bad.” Then she called her dress “hideous.”
Generally, the red carpet no longer nurtures this kind of discourse. There has been a shift, over the past decade, from seeing famous people as wealthy elites deserving of mockery to just-like-us humans deserving of compassion. E! hiring Cox, whose first show as host was in December 2021, seems to be part of this shift.
“We were looking for a fresh voice and fresh perspective, particularly somebody who could be both a Hollywood insider and a fan,” said Cassandra Tryon, the senior vice president for live events for NBCUniversal television and streaming (NBCUniversal owns E!). “It’s like moving from a journalistic interview to a host of a party, and everybody wants to talk to the host.”
The strategy, according to the network, has been working. While awards shows have struggled with viewership, the Grammy Awards’ live carpet telecast in February drew about 1.1 million viewers — the most for any E! program since 2020 (surpassing a season premiere episode of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians”).
“It is a craft too, by the way, to be a host,” Tryon said, sitting in a room at the Hollywood Roosevelt, where the courtyard becomes an E! set during the Oscars. It was the eve of what she called the network’s Super Bowl.
Oh, the humanity.
“I feel nervous,” Cox said toward the end of rehearsals late Saturday afternoon. Outside of the Dolby Theatre, plastic still covered the champagne-colored carpet and mummified a jumbo Oscars statue facing the E! cameras.
She had spent five hours on Friday reviewing and reworking questions for the nominees and presenters. There was a thick stack of cue cards for every name — some confirmed to stop and speak to Cox on the carpet, others more wishful. (“We always prep Cate” — Blanchett, that is — “and she never stops,” Cox bemoaned to her producers.) A card could have four questions, but once cameras start rolling, only one or two may make it to air.
The Oscars carpet is a particularly overstuffed carpet; E! doesn’t get a platform here, unlike at some other ceremonies. Which means there is a steady torrent of people — attendees, staff, photographers, publicists, assistants — jostling behind Cox as she works.
Her interviews must be quick, to maximize the number of high-profile guests featured during E!’s three-hour broadcast, which jumps between Cox’s carpet interviews and a group of commentators at the Hollywood Roosevelt, or stationed on a nearby rooftop.
Cox has an earpiece and at least two people cuing her on-site: a stage manager and a supervising producer named Sam Bellikoff, the creator of the cue cards and master of pronunciations (“Ana de Armas ,” “Banshees of Inisherin ”), who sometimes sits at Cox’s feet, tapping her leg. (One piece of E! interviewing wisdom imparted by Tryon: Skip asking people how they’re feeling, since everyone asks that, and the answers are often generic.)
In explaining what she’s trying to accomplish as a host, Cox pointed to a Grammys interview with Machine Gun Kelly, in which he admitted to lacking “self-love,” in the context of losing awards. Cox told him: “Ultimately, there’s nothing outside of us that can make us love ourselves more. It has to come from inside.”
That moment epitomized her desire to “create space for people to come and be themselves,” she said. “It can be frivolous. It can be silly.” She has no problem screaming as if she’s about to faint, casually asking her co-hosts for “tea” or referring to her interview subjects as just “girl.”
“But it can also be deep,” she said. “What does it mean to be human?”
Speaking to Questlove on Sunday about his next documentary — about Sly and the Family Stone and mental health in the Black community — Cox cited the phrase “post-traumatic slave syndrome,” coined by Joy DeGruy. “Where was the mental health after emancipation?” Cox said. Later in the show, she asked director Sarah Polley about Rooney Mara’s use of a fart machine on the set of “Women Talking.” She whips between nuance and nuttiness.
“In doing this job, I feel like the public has gotten to see a different side of me,” said Cox, who is best known for her role on “Orange Is the New Black,” which was on Netflix from 2013 to 2019, and earned her four Emmy nominations and two SAG ensemble acting awards. “It’s been a different way for me, hopefully, to highlight people’s humanity. As an artist, we’re arbiters of empathy and humanity. And I think it’s possible as a red-carpet host to also do that.”
Yet it’s harder to do that in 60-second increments, in the heat of a celebrity battle zone, dodging Molotov cocktails of opulence and Ozempic.
Speaking by phone Monday, Cox said she felt “off” during the previous night’s broadcast, during which she completed 31 interviews (according to E!). She had some trouble breathing comfortably after choosing a particularly tight corset to wear with her Vera Wang gown (“ethereal Blade Runner,” she called the sea-foam-and-black look), and she noticed the Oscars guests seemed more weary, compared with their excitement at the start of the awards season.
“I think I was frustrated with wanting to have deeper interactions and having so little time,” she said. “I’m always looking for connection. I’m always looking for something that feels authentic and unexpected.
“There’s never enough time.”
‘What story are you telling us with this look tonight?’
If there’s one thing alone that will define Cox’s tenure as a red carpet host, it’s the way she has retooled the question “Who are you wearing tonight?”
Backlash to that question began to swell in 2015, when celebrities including Reese Witherspoon drew attention to a campaign called #AskHerMore. After the #MeToo movement took off in late 2017, there was a call for interviewers, including Rancic and Ryan Seacrest on E!, to ask more substantive questions too.
Yet Cox, a fashion enthusiast — she wore a vintage Mugler suit to her rehearsal Saturday — had no intention of eliminating the discussion of fashion. After she took over the hosting job, she asked attendees: “What story are you trying to tell with your look tonight?”
The quality of answers vary. Sometimes they’re funny or thoughtful, and sometimes, as Austin Butler said of his Saint Laurent suit Sunday night: “I don’t know what story I’m telling you. I just thought it was a beautiful tuxedo.” That’s fine with Cox, too. “The question for me is just an invitation to think differently about what we put on our backs,” she said.
It is a question that has been applauded by the Representation Project, the organization behind the #AskHerMore campaign: “The way that she is approaching questions about fashion is a layer I’ve never seen on the red carpet,” said Caroline Heldman, the executive director. Heldman added that there is still work to be done. The Representation Project tracked four hours of red carpet coverage Sunday night — two on ABC and two on E! — and found that women were still twice as likely as men to be asked about what they were wearing.
But the question is also rooted in Cox’s experience as a transgender woman. “My own relationship to fashion has always been an attempt to communicate to the world who I am,” she said. “Pre-transition, there was someone inside that was not reflected on the outside.”
Generally, though, Cox said she appreciates that her identity and activism aren’t at the forefront of her hosting role: “What I do love about my job at E! is that, particularly as a host, I’m openly trans, but it’s not about me being trans.”
Last month, at the Grammys, Cox was approached by Dylan Mulvaney, a TikTok creator who has been documenting her own transition, and who wanted to make a video with Cox. In the clip, Cox cautioned Mulvaney to “make sure you keep things to yourself — everything cannot be the public.”
It was classic advice from Cox, who considers herself a private person. She referred to “having a cry” recently over not spending much time with her boyfriend, though when she was pressed for more details, she said she was “trying to keep him off the radar.”
Tryon said E! considers Cox’s activism “as a plus” that gives her “a unique connection to celebrities.” That connection is the priority, Tryon said, along with “how to make it fun and light and safe for Laverne’s guests.”
Cox said the only hesitation she had before taking the hosting job was whether it would make people in the industry, and in the public more widely, “forget that I’m also an actor,” she said. She is less worried about that now. Next week, she’ll travel to Georgia to begin work on a sitcom produced by Norman Lear. Her contract with E! runs through the end of 2023.
But her appreciation for acting is not something that many in her E! audience — those watching the long hours of rapid interviews — are likely to forget. Often her questions and comments touch on the preparation and physicality and history of acting. She once got a note from her producers that said the audience didn’t like these craft questions, she said. It didn’t stop her.
“I’m an actress,” she said. “I’m obsessed with craft.”

Skis, Songs and Shots at a Supremely Norwegian Sports Festival

OSLO, Norway — For two days before this year’s Holmenkollen cross-country ski races, Espen Garder took his remote meetings from a heated tent in the forest. Breaks came only for lunch and battery charging at a restaurant up the hill.
Garder, 53, had arrived early to claim a spot, not just for himself but also for the dozen Boy Scouts he leads. They would join him for the weekend, eager to sleep in the subfreezing temperatures along the 5-mile racing loop.
Thousands more fans, no less excitable, would take day trips on Oslo’s metro system to pack Holmenkollen’s ski area for one of the world’s most improbable winter sports festivals, capped by a weekend of cheering, drinking and mania for cross-country skiing, which in Norway is something like a religion.
To picture the festival’s scale, and its vibe, think Scandinavian Super Bowl crossed with New York City Marathon: urban, Olympic-level competition, with spectators in wool sweaters and suspenders, campfires grilling hot dogs and enough beer and liquor for a small army.
Andrew Musgrave, a British cross-country skier who lives and trains in Norway, described it this way: “It’s like a bunch of Vikings going out and getting smashed in the woods and cheering on some people floating around on planks.”
Two 50-kilometer ski marathons — one for men and this year, for the first time, one for women — are the heart of the 10-day festival, which also includes biathlon and ski jumping competitions, plus a relay race for younger athletes. Outside the ropes, there’s something for everyone else: a massive, trail-side party for college students and recent graduates; a family area for quieter camping; a box for the royal family; and for fans focused on athletic performance, a grandstand in Holmenkollen’s ski stadium.
At their core, the cross-country events are celebrations of Norwegian values: hard work, persistence and tradition, according to Thor Gotaas, a folklorist whose 22 books on skiing have made him a minor Norwegian celebrity.
“It reflects the spirit of the people that survived in this country,” Gotaas said in an interview at his home in Oslo, two leisurely hours interrupted only by his occasionally feeding fresh logs into a roaring fire in his wood stove. A 50-kilometer race — just over 31 miles — requires more than technical skill, he said. “You have to be stubborn.”
While many of Holmenkollen’s traditions have endured, and winners still get an audience with Norway’s king, today’s events are barely recognizable from the area’s first ski races, which began in 1892 and took contestants as long as 5-1/2 hours to complete.
Many of the early competitors were woodsmen who sometimes had to ski farther to get to the train to Oslo than the 30 or so miles they would race once they arrived. The most elite racers looked different then, too; even as the clock ticked, some would stop to eat steaks and recharge with a mixture of coffee and alcohol, Gotaas said.
Athletes can now cover the 50-kilometer distance in less than two hours. They stay at a luxury hotel next to the trails overlooking Oslo. And they are full-time racers, with drug testers who collect blood and urine samples at the finish and endorsement deals that put their faces on advertisements at the nearest metro stop.
The most recent change at Holmenkollen is one that many said was overdue: This year was the first in which women raced the full 50-kilometer distance, up from the 19 miles, or 30 kilometers, they had skied for decades.
The extended women’s event came amid a broader debate about equalizing distances in cross-country skiing, where men still race twice as far as women in some Olympic and world championship events. The discourse has revealed a surprising level of resistance among female European skiers, some of whom have said they fear audiences will tune out if their races take too long. Other top competitors were happy to ski the extra miles. In the debut race, the Norwegians Ragnhild Gloersen Haga and Astrid Oyre Slind took the top two places.
Slind, a distance specialist, was skiing her third long race in just over a week. After a 30-kilometer competition in Slovenia the previous Saturday, she had hopped on a sponsor’s plane to Sweden, slept three hours and placed fifth out of more than 2,000 women in a 55-mile race there.
“It’s not a big thing,” she said. “I’m kind of used to it.”
American Jessie Diggins, a three-time Olympic medalist, placed third after battling muscle cramps for half the race. She was part of a community of U.S. athletes and coaches that led a campaign to equalize distances in Oslo and elsewhere on the international circuit.
“Imagine, we didn’t need to be carted off in an ambulance,” Diggins said Sunday, her sarcasm as thick as the snow.
Diggins, 31, has become a favorite in Norway, where spectators pride themselves on their enthusiasm for the international field — with the exception, perhaps, of their rivals from Sweden. One Norwegian fan club has even serenaded Diggins with a personalized song at events. (Its lyrics include: “She looks like she’s a teen; she’s better than the queen.”)
You have to be drunk when you sing the song, Diggins said, an acknowledgment of just how much a part of Norwegian ski fandom alcohol has become.
“Norwegians don’t talk to each other unless they’re drinking,” said Espen Antonsen, 32, who camped with a few friends along the trail over the weekend.
One year at Holmenkollen, Antonsen said, he drank with the father of an Olympic medalist, producing photographic proof.
“He was drunk and I was drunk,” Antonsen said. “And it was really fun.”
That proximity to athletes and their families is also a part of the Holmenkollen charm. Fans can walk across the race trail at designated points, hurl insults at Swedes from well within earshot and hand sausages, waffles and drinks across the fence to athletes who fall off the leaders’ pace.
“I’ve had plenty of bad races in Holmenkollen where I’ve been off the back,” Musgrave said. “So I’ve had my share of beer and shots.” He crossed the line in 11th place Saturday, presumably free of waffles and aquavit, a Scandinavian liquor.
The festival is at its loudest and most boisterous at Frognerseteren, where the loop reaches the top of a hill at its most distant point from the stadium. Thousands of fans, mostly there to party and many of them in their 20s, fill the woods in time for the 10 a.m. start, shovel out their own seating areas and turn the course into a tunnel of noise.
For Norwegian athletes, that kind of atmosphere makes winning at Holmenkollen an achievement to rival an Olympic medal. Before the world championships were held at the venue in 2011, Norway star Petter Northug Jr. spent years training specifically for the 50-kilometer race. When he finally won it, he found himself lacking purpose.
“Some days, I didn’t get out of bed because I’d won the 50k in Oslo,” Northug said in an interview. “What was there more to win?”
Holmenkollen’s two-hour races, which are televised nationally, have shown enduring popularity in Norway even as organizers say they now compete with other events in the city and Netflix for the attention of both fans and the next generation of racers.
If anything, the biggest threat to the event may be Norway’s dominance of cross-country skiing. In the men’s race Saturday, Norwegians took the first 10 spots in the final results. Athletes and coaches on the international circuit have long said that more nations need to be vying for the podium to sustain the interest and television rights income outside Scandinavia that sustain the sport.
“We are really good in cross-country skiing,” Martin Johnsrud Sundby, a Norwegian Olympian turned commentator, said after his country’s dominating performances at the world championships this month. “But it’s not good to be good in cross-country skiing if nobody else is good.”
Events like those at Holmenkollen are what seed Norway’s system with new stars. While the partying at Frognerseteren draws much of the attention, those camping and cheering on other parts of the course include children who then get hooked.
“I talk about it every day,” said William Rannekleiv Kjendlie, 12, who camped this year with his father in the family area, in a tent fitted with a wood stove and animal skins.
Iver Tildheim Andersen, a 22-year-old Norwegian phenom who finished fourth Saturday, said being a part of the huge crowds at Northug’s victory in 2011 persuaded him to join a ski club and start training.
“I was just chilling and eating hot dogs and having fun,” Andersen said. “It was like, ‘Maybe I can race in Holmenkollen one day, and experience the same stuff.’” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Vice President Issue: Stakes Are High: [Correction]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Voters Should Pick the Vice President," by Greg Craig (Opinion guest essay, March 5):
Mr. Craig's article raises a larger question. The vice-presidential nominees of the two major parties are too often chosen largely or entirely because of their perceived ability to help elect their presidential running mate, rather than an apparent ability to act as president if needed.
Considering the stakes, the main or sole criterion in selecting a vice-presidential nominee should be that person's capacity to immediately and competently step into the president's shoes, if required.
Just in the last century, Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan all labored under the specters of age, infirmity or both. This clearly demonstrates the national interest in vice-presidential nominees having the qualifications, experience, health and ability to competently represent the country as a whole.
If a vice-presidential nominee is also a plausible national candidate in her or his own right, all the better, and having a nominee of such stature should benefit his or her party and the ticket.
Over the last 50 years, some vice presidents, such as Spiro Agnew (crook), Dan Quayle (lightweight) and Dick Cheney (unelectable) were unqualified, and Mike Pence seems marginal. Lyndon B. Johnson, Nelson Rockefeller, Walter Mondale, George H.W. Bush, Al Gore and Joe Biden were clearly qualified, reflecting positively on those who chose them.
The question for whoever chooses vice-presidential nominees should always be "Can this person competently lead the country?" -- not "Will this person help our party get elected?"
Anders I. Ourom

To the Editor:
I'm very grateful for "Voters Should Pick the Vice President." Greg Craig has raised perhaps the most significant and worrying issue, however delicate, of the Biden candidacy.
Given the entirely realistic concerns over President Biden's age and chances of dying in office in a second term (and I write as an 87-year-old in decent health), the choice of a running mate shouldn't be a reflexive decision.
It should be one requiring a great deal of thought, consultation and polling about who could handle the most demanding of offices in these difficult and perilous times -- and whom a wide spectrum of Democratic voters see as the most convincing possibility as their next president.
Barbara Quart
New York
To the Editor:
As our octogenarian president ponders another presidential run, he needs to consider replacing his 2020 running mate. It's a delicate subject, sure to arouse fierce opposition within the Democratic Party (however it's accomplished).
Forget loyalty, tradition or popularity. In 2024, the top priority for selecting the second-highest elected official in the country should be proven foreign policy experience.
President Biden has an age problem that he can't control. It will be a major campaign issue that will only place greater emphasis on who would be next in line for the presidency.
Continued support for Ukraine (including maintaining the broad coalition of European and NATO nations forged by President Biden) and other brewing major-power standoffs demand a vice president with longstanding, first-rate diplomatic skills.
Replace Kamala Harris with Susan Rice, the longtime diplomat and policy adviser. It's time to dispel conventional wisdom and go bold.

Mike Pence, It's Time 'to Do the Right Thing'
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Asks Judge to Block Pence's Testimony to Grand Jury" (news article, nytimes.com, March 4):
There is no doubt that former Vice President Mike Pence did the right thing (and his constitutional duty) by certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election in favor of Joe Biden.
Now is the time for Mr. Pence to do the right thing by honoring the Justice Department's subpoena to testify about his knowledge of the events before and after Jan. 6. Mr. Pence says he will fight the subpoena, citing specious legal arguments. But why?
Mr. Pence, you know what former President Donald Trump did and did not do. Tell us. It is your duty as a citizen, and it is the right thing to do.

To the Editor:
Re "Pence Says That History Will Judge Trump" (news article, March 13):
The shortcoming of former Vice President Mike Pence's pronouncement that "history will hold Donald Trump accountable" for the former president's lead in fomenting the violent Capitol insurrection is obvious.
History's verdict takes a long while, and it is rarely unanimous and subject to revisionism.
Mr. Trump and his minions must pay the price now, and Mr. Pence should render an unequivocal verdict to that end, instead of punting into history.
Justice delayed is justice denied, especially in this case.

What Chris Rock Gets to Be
To the Editor:
Re "Chris Rock Looks Very Small Right Now," by Roxane Gay (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, March 11):
Chris Rock's recent Netflix special certainly deserves critique, but Ms. Gay's article gets one thing very wrong. As the target of another man's violence, Mr. Rock is not responsible for entertaining us with his response to that attack, nor redeeming himself with the right joke.
He gets to just be angry.

Stains Left on a Rare Text
To the Editor:
"For Rare Book Librarians, It's Gloves Off. Seriously" (Arts, March 11) notes that stains left on a rare book tell us something about who has used it in the past.
I was once privileged to see the original Sarajevo Haggadah, one of the oldest extant Passover Haggadahs. It dates to the 14th century.
I was deeply moved to see this ancient text. But what I remember best were the wine stains on some of the pages. Clearly, long before this book had become a priceless object listed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register, someone had used it at a Seder and had, as still happens in the 21st century, spilled their wine on it.

Family Values? We Need to Talk About School Shootings.
To the Editor:
Re "The Party of Family Values Should Truly Value Families," by Patrick T. Brown (Opinion guest essay, March 9):
The idea of a political "parents' party" may be a good one, but the total absence of any discussion regarding school shootings is glaring. Republicans won't be much of a parents' party if they can't figure out how to deal with an issue that parents and their children think about every day.

In the late 1960s, young cineastes shook up a moribund film industry by delivering idiosyncratic, startlingly original work. The moment became known as New Hollywood.
When film historians look back at the 95th Academy Awards, they may mark it as the start of a new New Hollywood. The head-twisting, TikTok-era, sex toy-brandishing “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” directed by a young filmmaking duo and featuring a mostly Asian lead cast, received a field-leading 11 nominations, including best picture and director. As the ceremony got underway, the futuristic film collected the first two of the four acting awards, with Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis honored as best supporting actor and actress.
“They say stories like this only happen in the movies,” Quan said as tears streamed down his face and attendees gave him a standing ovation. “I can’t believe it’s happening to me. This is the American dream.”
Quan’s win provided the Academy Awards with a hall-of-fame comeback story: After early success in movies like “The Goonies” and “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,” his acting career grew so cold that he turned to stunt work. “Dreams are something you have to believe in,” Quan said. “I almost gave up on mine. To everyone out there, please keep your dreams alive.”
Curtis was also in tears by the time she reached the fiery conclusion of her acceptance speech. “To all of the people who have supported the genre movies that I have made for all these years,” she said, “the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people, we just won an Oscar together!”
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences spread nominations remarkably far and wide this year. Two blockbuster sequels, “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Top Gun: Maverick,” made the best picture cut, along with the German-language “All Quiet on the Western Front” — a film so traditional that a previous adaptation of the famed novel won the best picture Oscar in 1931. “All Quiet on the Western Front” received nine nominations in total, with strength in craft categories counterbalancing a lack of acting honors; early in the ceremony, the film received the Oscars for cinematography and international film.
In some ways, spreading nominations widely reflected the jumbled state of Hollywood. No one in the movie capital seems to know which end is up, with streaming services like Netflix — which was behind “All Quiet on the Western Front” — hot then not, and studios unsure about how many films to release in theaters and whether anything but superheroes, sequels and horror stories can succeed. Over the weekend, “Scream VI” was the top movie at the North American box office, with an estimated $44.5 million in ticket sales.
First-time nominees filled 16 of the 20 acting slots, with new stars like Austin Butler (“Elvis”), Barry Keoghan (“The Banshees of Inisherin”), Brian Tyree Henry (“Causeway”), Paul Mescal (“Aftersun”) and Stephanie Hsu (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”) honored for breakthrough roles.
But first-time acting nominations also went to Hollywood stalwarts like Curtis, Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”) and Michelle Yeoh (“Everything Everywhere All at Once”).
To some degree, the inclusion of Quan, Curtis, Fraser and Yeoh was seen as redemption for Hollywood: All had somehow been cast to the side at some point over their careers.
The academy was also trying to balance old and new in the Oscars ceremony itself. The academy’s CEO had promised a return to the polished, glamorous Oscar ceremonies of the past to recover from last year’s chaotic telecast, when an angry Will Smith walked onstage and slapped Chris Rock. In a change from last year, when eight categories were scuttled to a nontelevised portion, all 23 Oscars were handed out live on air.
Jimmy Kimmel arrived on the Oscars stage by parachute, moments after a pair of “Top Gun”-style fighter jets flew over the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles at 345 mph, and breezed through a self-assured monologue that left the A-listers seated before him cheering in support. He teased Steven Spielberg — gently — for his lack of recreational drug use and Fraser and Quan for once appearing together in “Encino Man.” It was the kind of affable ribbing that once made Billy Crystal the king of the Oscar emcee’s.
“And if any of you get offended by a joke and decide you want to come up here and get jiggy with it? It’s not going to be easy,” Kimmel said, addressing last year’s slap without directly mentioning Smith. He then joked that people like Michael B. Jordan, the “Creed” star, and Pedro Pascal, who plays the title role in “The Mandalorian,” were prepared to intervene.
“Seriously, the academy has a crisis team in place,” Kimmel said. “If anything unpredictable or violent happens during the ceremony, just do what you did last year — nothing. Maybe even give the assailant a hug.”
As expected, “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio” received the Oscar for best animated feature, and “Navalny” was honored as best documentary. Less anticipated was Ruth Carter’s win for her “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” costume design. (Most awards handicappers had predicted victory for the “Elvis” costume designer Catherine Martin. Carter also won for “Black Panther” in 2019.)
The #OscarsSoWhite outcries from 2015 and 2016, prompted by all-white slates of acting nominees, continue to reverberate at the academy, which has been trying to diversify its membership by race, gender and nationality. Nearly 50% of the academy’s most recent class of new members came from overseas. About 25% of the academy’s total membership of 10,000 now comes from outside the United States.
But the academy was criticized this year for not nominating any women in the best director category. For decades, women and people of color were almost entirely excluded from the directing race. In 2021, for the first time, two women were nominated: Chloé Zhao (“Nomadland”) and Emerald Fennell (“Promising Young Woman”), with Zhao winning. Last year, Jane Campion (“The Power of the Dog”) won the Oscar for directing.
This year, Sarah Polley (“Women Talking”) was left out even though her film was nominated for best picture. (Polley received a nomination for best adapted screenplay.) “I give up,” Patty Jenkins, whose directing credits include “Wonder Woman” and “Monster,” told Variety on Saturday about women being shut out of the category. “It’s still going to take a long ways to go. It’s going to take a lot more to really see truly more diverse awards.”
The internationalization of the academy was on display among this year’s directing nominees. Swedish filmmaker Ruben Ostlund (“Triangle of Sadness”) and British-born Martin McDonagh (“The Banshees of Inisherin”) were honored. Joining them were Todd Field (Tár) and the Daniels, the young filmmaking duo behind “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” (The Daniels is an oh-so-cool sobriquet for Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.) Filling out the best director category was Spielberg — a director who was once part of that New Hollywood crew and is now a Hollywood elder statesman with nine total nominations for directing, this one for “The Fabelmans.”
The academy emphasized that the ceremony would feel modern — part of an urgent effort to make the telecast more relevant to young people. The 2022 show drew 16.6 million viewers, the second-worst turnout on record after the pandemic-affected 2021 telecast. If the Nielsen ratings do not improve, the academy faces a financial precipice: Most of its revenue comes from the sale of broadcasting rights to the show. Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake. (The most-viewed Oscars telecast was in 1998, when 57.2 million people watched “Titanic” win the trophy for best picture.)
The nominee pool for best picture has never before included more than one billion-dollar ticket seller, according to box office databases, and this year there were two. “Top Gun: Maverick” collected $1.5 billion, and “Avatar: The Way of Water” took in $2.3 billion. (Viewership tends to increase when popular films are nominated.)
In another change, the red carpet was not red: Stars walked a Champagne-colored rug, breaking with a 62-year tradition. The choice was made as part of an overhaul of the preshow spectacle, which, for the first time, was managed by members of the Met Gala’s creative team. In the days leading up to the Oscars, another in a series of rainstorms soaked Los Angeles, so much so that the academy sent an alert to the news media Wednesday warning that it may “need to clear the carpet at a moment’s notice.” In the end, the weather cooperated, and it was a sunny 63 degrees.

Full text: Since the Ukraine war, pregnant Russians have been flocking to the South American country where obtaining citizenship is relatively easy -- if your child is born there.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The passengers drifted away until only the pregnant women remained at passport control.
Among them was Maria Konovalova, who was pulled aside and asked about her pregnancy. She was 26 weeks pregnant, she said she told the immigration officials last month at Buenos Aires' international airport.
She was sent to join several other pregnant Russians in a common area of the airport, where they dragged furniture together and cracked jokes to calm their nerves.
"It was rather strange to see, it was a camp of pregnant women," recounted Mrs. Konovalova, who was held for 24 hours until a judge ordered the release of all six detained women.
Since the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, thousands of Russians have arrived in Argentina with a baby on the way, lured by the country's relatively easy and speedy path to a passport that will give their children and them more freedom than their Russian passports.
Russians don't need a visa to enter Argentina. And once they give birth, their children are automatically Argentine citizens, granting parents a right to permanent residency and opening a fast track to an Argentine passport.
"When I found out I was going to have a boy, I said, 'I have to move, I don't want him to become meat in that country,"' said Mrs. Konovalova, 25, who is from St. Petersburg, Russia.
What began as a trickle has exploded in popularity, according to Argentine migration officials. About 4,500 Russians arrived in January, four times as many as last January, though it is not clear how many were pregnant women. Two major hospitals in Buenos Aires say that Russian women delivered 25 percent to 45 percent of the babies born in their maternity wards in December and January.
Companies in Argentina are cashing in on the global turmoil spurred by the Russian invasion of Ukraine by aggressively marketing child births in the country as a pathway to citizenship.
"Childbirth in Argentina. The second passport for parents is the fastest in the world!" RU Argentina, an organization that assists Russians in Argentina, proclaims on its website. Its V.I.P. package, which includes translators, Spanish lessons and permanent residency for parents, costs $ 15,000.
Another agency, Eva Clinic, showcases private hospitals and tips for discovering Buenos Aires on its Instagram feed. One recent night at the international airport, it welcomed Ekaterina Bibisheva, a Russian sexologist and blogger with 4.8 million Instagram followers, with a banner and flowers as two men in Argentina soccer jerseys performed football tricks for her and her family.
"I heard childbirth in Argentina was like a fairy tale," Ms. Bibisheva, 34, told Dr. Karina Fraga through a translator a few days later during an appointment in Buenos Aires. Sculptures of pregnant women adorned the obstetrician's office, and a bowl full of candy with Russian wrappers sat on her desk.
Already a mother of two, she had long wanted to experience a birth in Argentina. The passport "is a bonus," said Ms. Bibisheva, whose mission is to educate women on how to revel in their sexuality.
Some organizations have drawn the scrutiny of Argentine lawmakers who say their open door migration policy is being abused.
Florencia Carignano, Argentina's director of migrations, believes that most Russians expecting babies don't intend to live in Argentina, but are looking for a passport that allows them to enter more than 170 countries visa-free and to obtain a U.S. visa that is valid for up to 10 years. Currently, Russians can enter 87 countries without a visa.
Her department is taking a harder look at Russians, canceling the permanent residencies of people spending significant time outside Argentina and conducting address checks on recently arrived pregnant women to ensure they are actually living there.
"What is at stake is the security of our passport," Ms. Carignano said in a television interview, citing a case involving two people accused of being Russian spies in Slovenia who were found in possession of an Argentine passport.
The police are also investigating the possibility that some organizations helping Russians could be laundering money and involved in organized crime. Last month, officers raided an organization that had been accused of using fraudulent documentation to help Russians obtain residency and citizenship papers.
Christian Rubilar, an immigration lawyer, who represented three of the six pregnant women who had been detained at the airport, called the reaction of Argentine officials discriminatory.
While it is true that an Argentine baby enables parents to avoid a two-year waiting period typically required before applying for citizenship, he said, other steps must still be met.
"The most important one is living here," which means spending at least seven months of the year in Argentina, Mr. Rubilar said. It then takes one to three years to become a citizen, he said.
For Pavel Kostomarov, an acclaimed Russian film director, obtaining passports was about protecting his family.
He immigrated to Argentina last May with his wife, Maria Rashka, a movie production designer. Fearing for their safety because of their support for an opposition politician, they fled Moscow, eventually arriving in Argentina. Their daughter, Alexandra, was born in August -- their "little porteño," a term that refers to someone born in the Argentine capital.
"Russian people are looking for where to escape," Mr. Kostomarov, 47, said. "We don't want to be part of aggression. It's very shameful. We're not fighters, we're not revolutionaries."
Their plan, he said, is to stay in Argentina "to save a young life." They are trying to adapt a Netflix film that Mr. Kostomarov was slated to start filming in Russia before the war broke out.
In Buenos Aires, the new Russian presence is noticeable in Palermo, a trendy neighborhood, and Recoleta, an upscale district, where many have settled. Russian is often heard on the street and local hospitals have signs in Cyrillic script.
The New York Times spoke with 10 families with infants or a baby on the way. Most had come on their own, without the help of any organization. Many are taking intensive Spanish lessons. They are looking for work, or managing remote jobs in different time zones. Networks of support on Telegram, a messaging app, offer tips on how to settle in and navigate a new culture.
Irina Bugaeva, 31, and her husband, Aisen Sergeev, 32, chose Argentina because of its welcoming reputation. They are Yakut, Indigenous people who live in northern Russia. When President Vladimir Putin announced the mobilization of soldiers in September, they feared that Mr. Sergeev would be enlisted.
"They were taking people from villages who don't know about their rights," said Ms. Bugaeva, who works in film production alongside her husband. Their son, Duolan, was born in November, and they have been living off savings and the money Mr. Sergeev brings in from freelance contracts. They also have a daughter, Leia, who is 5.
"I miss winter. I miss minus 50, even if it sounds crazy -- but I do," said Ms. Bugaeva, who is also a women's rights and environmental activist. "I really want to come back home, but home is not home anymore."
At an antiwar demonstration outside the Russian Embassy in Buenos Aires on the one-year anniversary of the invasion last month, couples carrying their babies dotted the crowd.
Among them was Mrs. Konovalova, who works as an English tutor, with a protest sticker on her pregnant belly.
After her experience at the airport, she worried about being unwanted in her new home. But she focused on getting an apartment, finding a hospital and waiting for her husband, Yuriy, to arrive. She ran to him when he walked out of the airport gates two weeks after her own arrival, and buried her face in the crook of his neck.
Initially, their plan had been to come for the baby's passport and move on. But now they intend to stay, and see what Argentina has in store for them.
"It's about looking for life, with the big letter L," Mrs. Konovalova said. "In Russia, it's not life, it's about surviving."

Among them was Konovalova, who works as an English tutor, with a protest sticker on her pregnant belly.
After her experience at the airport, she worried about being unwanted in her new home. But she focused on getting an apartment, finding a hospital and waiting for her husband, Yuriy, to arrive. She ran to him when he walked out of the airport gates two weeks after her own arrival, and buried her face in the crook of his neck.
Initially, their plan had been to come for the baby’s passport and move on. But now they intend to stay, and see what Argentina has in store for them.
“It’s about looking for life, with the big letter L,” Konovalova said. “In Russia it’s not life, it’s about surviving.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The awards telecast has been losing viewers for years. New leadership wants to reverse that starting Sunday, and ensure the financial well-being of the organization.
The stage design for the 95th Academy Awards on Sunday is more Doctor Strange modern and less Dowager Countess musty. That means plentiful video screens, including ones that cover the sides of the theater, with nary a Swarovski crystal curtain -- the old standby -- to be seen.
In a change from last year, when eight categories were awarded during a nontelevised portion, all of the Oscars will be handed out live on air. To make the telecast interactive and help viewers better understand crafts categories, such as sound mixing and art direction, QR codes will appear before commercial breaks to direct viewers to internet vignettes about the nominees and behind-the-scenes footage and photos.
To reinvigorate the red carpet preshow, Oscars organizers hired members of the Met Gala creative team. Expect much more star power, specialized lighting (to make a process that happens in daylight seem more like evening) and better integration with the theater's entrance.
But some of the most important changes -- part of an urgent effort to make the Academy Awards more relevant to young people and draw a broader international audience -- involve things that most viewers won't notice. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will post video of acceptance speeches in the six biggest categories in near real time on TikTok and Facebook, and all speeches will quickly be posted on Twitter. In a first, Disney+ will stream the Oscars show live in parts of Europe.
The academy has also sought out new marketing partners like Letterboxd, a social media site for movie fans (8.4 million members, most of them ages 18 to 34), in a sad-but-true admission that it must convince people that they should care about the Oscars.
"We didn't have to before," Janet Yang, the academy's president, said in an interview at the organization's Beverly Hills offices. "We could rest on our laurels and just let it carry itself."
One might respond with exasperation: You're only now figuring that out? Perhaps the time to pull out all the stops to keep the Oscars vibrant was five years ago, when the telecast, for the first time, attracted fewer than 30 million people, a 20 percent decline from the previous year.
Since then, the number of viewers for the Academy Awards has dropped another 37 percent, according to Nielsen's data. About 16.6 million people watched "CODA" win the Oscar for best picture at the most recent ceremony, with viewership swelling after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock onstage late in the show.
But Ms. Yang can't be held responsible. She was elected president only in August. The academy also has a new chief executive for the first time in 11 years; Bill Kramer, the former director of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, was appointed to that role in June. Together, Ms. Yang and Mr. Kramer have brought a blast of fresh air to the stuffy organization, working to improve transparency, calm a membership revolt over last year's removal of several categories from the live Oscars telecast and shore up the academy's wobbly finances.
In the past, Ms. Yang said, "a lot of cultural institutions felt like they should be sitting on a hill, a little bit more protected, almost untouchable." She added that the academy itself felt "ivory tower-ish," but that it was now "a different time" and "a different culture."
ABC has exclusive rights to broadcast the Oscars ceremony until 2028 and provides the academy with about 80 percent of its annual revenue. Last year, Oscar-related revenue was $ 137.1 million, according to financial disclosures. Awards-related expenses totaled $ 56.8 million.
The TV network generated an estimated $ 139 million across 70 commercials during last year's show, according to Vivvix, which tracks ad spending. (To compare, ABC pulled in about $ 129 million across 56 ads in 2020.) A red carpet preshow brought in an additional $ 16 million in advertising revenue.
To secure a distribution contract of similar value when its deal with ABC expires, the academy must reverse viewership declines. A less lucrative deal could imperil some of the organization's year-round activities, including film restoration.
"This is so important to the livelihood and future of the organization that we better confront it," Ms. Yang said.
In many ways, however, the academy is hamstrung when it comes to reinventing the Oscars telecast.
ABC and other traditional television networks are shadows of their former selves, with younger audiences in particular decamping en masse to streaming services. Some other awards shows are following them, notably the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which will stream live on Netflix starting next year. After an ethics, finance and diversity scandal, the Golden Globe Awards, long broadcast on NBC, are also looking for a new distribution partner.
Many viewers have long complained that the Oscars ceremony is overlong, with groan-inducing banter between presenters adding to a feeling of bloat. Last year's Academy Awards was three and a half hours, despite moving eight of the 23 awards off the live broadcast. (The offscreen acceptance speeches were recorded, edited and incorporated into the live show.) In the past, the Oscars telecast has run as long as four hours and 23 minutes.
Jimmy Kimmel will return as the host on Sunday, having served as M.C. in 2017 and 2018, and he has been planning a traditional monologue.
"We are working very hard to deliver the show on time with all disciplines honored," Mr. Kramer said.
Linda Ong, the chief executive of Cultique, a consulting firm in Los Angeles that advises companies on changing cultural norms, said people were still interested in the award show's winners and the things they had to say. The problem for the academy, she said, is that "people don't feel the need to watch the show to be part of the conversation."
"They just watch some clips on social," she added.
Ms. Ong noted that, in a once-unthinkable move that speaks to the Oscars' fading relevancy, the season finale of HBO's hugely popular post-apocalyptic drama, "The Last of Us," will broadcast head-to-head against the ceremony.
"That's a big cultural tell," she said.
The academy is hopeful that Nielsen's ratings meters for the Oscars will tick upward on Sunday. Big musical stars, including Rihanna, are scheduled to perform their nominated songs; Lenny Kravitz will perform during the "In Memoriam" segment. Lady Gaga will be absent, though, with Oscars producers saying on Wednesday that she was too busy filming a movie to perform her nominated song from "Top Gun: Maverick."
The nominee pool for best picture has never before included more than one billion-dollar ticket seller, according to box office databases, and this year there are two. "Top Gun: Maverick" collected $ 1.5 billion, and "Avatar: The Way of Water" took in $ 2.3 billion. The front-runner for best picture, "Everything Everywhere All at Once," generated $ 104 million in ticket sales. (Viewership tends to increase when popular films are nominated.)
But the academy says it's not just about TV anymore -- that relying on Nielsen's numbers alone to assess relevancy is outdated, and that online chatter and streaming-service viewing should also be taken into account.
"We have to rethink our success metrics," Mr. Kramer said, noting that the Oscars will be available for viewing on Hulu the next day.
Conversations on social media during and after award shows can be significant. Last month's Grammy Awards, for instance, attracted about 12.6 million viewers. On the day of the ceremony and the next day, the Grammys generated about seven million mentions on Twitter, according to ListenFirst, an analytics company.
If nothing else, the academy is hoping for a smooth show on Sunday. In the past, the academy started to plan for the Oscars as late as November. This time, planning started in June.
"It should be about unity and celebrating this industry," Mr. Kramer said. "People are still consuming movies. People love movies. Perhaps they're doing it on streaming more than they did a few years ago. But our art form is as relevant as ever."

Buy Something in Paris, Then Brag: [Style Desk]

Full text: Some classics, some new, some destination vintage boutiques worth checking out if you're lucky to be in France.
Paris is a city of easy pleasures. Wine, cheese, croissants. What's not to love? Isn't that what Netflix built the popularity of the très unrealistic "Emily in Paris" on? Except the thing about Paris is that it seems like a foolproof place, but it's not. Rather, it is a city that rewards research.
Prioritize idiosyncratic shops. Paris is still the kind of place where you can stumble upon a boutique that sells only gloves or umbrellas. There is nothing better than being able to announce to anyone listening that you got some supple belt or slipper or lamp or toothpaste in Paris.
Definitely check on the hours that shops are open because they can be highly unusual from a New Yorker's perspective. Some require appointments, but don't be intimidated by that. Be enticed at the potential, the uniqueness, the fun.
Strategize your day by neighborhood groupings. In the morning, go to a few stores around, say, Place Vendôme, capped off with a lazy lunch and some of the all-time great people-watching at Hotel Costes. (A fun game: "Is that his daughter or his girlfriend?") If you're a real demon, move on to another neighborhood. Otherwise take a nap, then go to a small museum like Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature, which is like entering into a Wes Anderson film set.
Paris has many of the same designer boutiques as New York and other large cities, so you might skip them. However! Between the exchange rate and the VAT return (a.k.a., tax refund), designer goods can be significantly cheaper. You'll need your passport in store. At the airport, remember to scan the forms or have them stamped before you check in and go through customs, as sometimes they ask to see the goods in person. Basically, this is a crucial way to justify buying things.
Resee
This is an online consignment store, but you can make an appointment and send links of what you like, then try it all on at its showroom. Allow Matt, who runs the showroom, to bring you a coffee, and try on a Jil Sander paisley dress from when Raf Simons was the designer or an ivory Chanel jacket like the one in "The Devil Wears Prada" or a ruffled Prada blouse consigned by Catherine Deneuve.
Le Bon Marché
All grand (and less than grand) department stores owe their existences to this place. Émile Zola used it as the setting for "The Ladies Paradise," in 1883. Here's how I navigate it. I go to the lingerie-swimwear section. The Empreinte lingerie brand for large busts and plus sizes is hard to find in the United States but has the most comfortable and beautiful collections.
The second floor has a beauty section for niche brands, where you can buy hair masks and dental floss from brands you've never heard of. Then do a loop of the designer collections as an overview to see which ones speak to you. Go to, say, Dries Van Noten for an immersive experience. Go to the Buly counter for souvenirs, like a lip balm that comes in a box that can be embossed with initials. Buy snacks at the food hall across the street, which sells things like carrot-passion fruit jam and has at least three aisles dedicated to yogurt. Open Sundays!
Sabbia Rosa
If your ideal look is '90s off-duty supermodel, this is your heaven. There are exquisite but extremely expensive handmade slips here. Everything can be custom-made, which is dangerous. Do not skip the satin mule slippers with the bow.
Monoprix
Monoprix is basically the French equivalent of Target. The organic cotton underwear comes in a ribbed culotte -- a bikini style -- or culotte haute, which is more like granny panties. They're not dissimilar to the handmade underwear from Zimmerli or Hanro but around five euros. Stock up on Savon de Marseille hand soap and filet à provisions, those net market bags.
Em Archives
This new vintage showroom made a cameo in the Blackbird Spyplane newsletter. On a recent visit, it had at least one oversize Donna Karan blouse, an Hermès blazer, Comme des Garçons flats from 1997 and several pairs of Jil Sander trousers at extremely competitive prices.
Flea Market
There are several flea markets in Paris, but the largest is the Puces de Paris Saint-Ouen at the northern border of the city. The place is gigantic, so you absolutely need some kind of strategy. Choose a category (a friend had great luck looking for antique tablecloths) or pick one area to browse. The Marché Paul Bert Serpette is my favorite and has a mix of furniture and clothes.
Will you find a deal? Maybe. Will you want to buy a chair and ship it home? Absolutely! There are shipping companies on site, or just build it a box and check it as oversize luggage on a flight home. For something easier to take home, De Laurentis has late '80s and early '90s European and Japanese minimalist designer clothes, and Chantal has beaded flapper dresses reminiscent of the first Bode women's collection.
Charvet
Who doesn't want to authentically dress like Lydia Tár these days? This is a multistory palace of tailoring. Get the slippers, get a striped nightshirt that can be worn as a dress, maybe get a rosette brooch made out of necktie material. Then cross to the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz for a cocktail. It's sort of like the Bemelmans Bar of Paris.
La Tuile à Loup
Maybe its stern but direct Instagram bio says it all: "Finest of handmade tableware. MADE IN FRANCE. International shipping available." Do you want a vase with a jellyfish on it? Or how about a marbled tray? Maybe all you need to know is that Ina Garten was recently photographed there.

Full text: Their reputations have caught up with them.
T'Azane Roberson, a student at California State University, Northridge, was approaching one year of on-again, off-again dating with a co-worker when she came to a realization she would eventually announce to her followers on Twitter: "My biggest mistake in life so far was dating a man with a podcast."
Ms. Roberson, 24, began seeing him in December 2021. He was 35 at the time and had dreams of being a social media influencer, she recalled. They both worked at an Amazon warehouse near her home in Lancaster, Calif. The "situationship," as she aptly called it, was "very embarrassing," but she continued to date him until January of this year.
"I knew he had a podcast, but I had never listened to it," she said. "I was like, OK, I like this man. I'm already ignoring his social media presence. I'm just going to forget he has a podcast."
Things were fine when they were together, so long as Ms. Roberson didn't think about his extracurriculars. Until one day he sent her a link to his show, inviting her to listen and share her thoughts. What she heard turned her off.
For Ms. Roberson, it wasn't just the content of the man's podcast, but that he had one at all. Like many other women, she associates the form with a certain kind of man: one who is endlessly fascinated by his own opinions, loves the sound of his own voice and isn't the least bit shy about offering unsolicited opinions on masculinity, sexuality and women. Many women have taken to social media to mock just that kind of programming and the men who make it.
On TikTok, hashtags like #menwithpodcasts gather videos of (mostly) women using a beard filter to satirize the sorts of things male podcast hosts say, such as: "Why, as a man, are you born in the month of February?" or "That's the problem with women who read." Others have called on them to "put down the mics" and "get a job!"
With the once-booming podcast industry currently on the back foot and hosts' reputations for self-important mansplaining having long since caught up with them, is the "podcast bro" officially a persona non grata in today's dating landscape?
In interviews with a handful of men who work or have worked in podcasting, some said they had come across romantic prospects who view their profession as a potential red flag. And even among those who haven't, some pre-emptively adjust their presentation of themselves to make a clear distinction.
Tyree Rush, a 29-year-old podcast producer in Atlanta, said he makes it a point not to list his profession on his dating-app profiles. Instead, he usually says he works in digital media.
"I was on a date in Chicago and I said that I said that I do digital strategy at first," he recalled in an interview. "So she kept pressing and I was like, 'Actually, I produce podcasts.' Now, maybe it's because I lied and said I did digital strategy first that she was not into it, but I also just think when she heard podcast, it was a cause of concern for her."
Mr. Rush added that she followed with, "don't tell me you're like doing like a Joe Budden podcast or anything like that."
Scrutiny of the podcast bro archetype has also appeared in other areas of pop culture. In the Netflix comedy "You People," Ezra, a white broker played by Jonah Hill, reveals to his date that his dream job is to do his hip-hop culture podcast full time, which is first met with laughter, followed quickly by judgment and concern.
Mr. Rush, who has worked for Marvel, iHeartMedia and the podcast network Wondery, said he understood the wariness, given the many things women have to be afraid of when it comes to dating men; a podcast is just another thing to worry about.
"It's like a new chivalry or etiquette that we're trying to figure out," he said.
Logan Mendoza, 23, is one of four hosts of SweeTalks, a video podcast on YouTube. He said they often get direct messages from men who enjoy their content, which he described as mostly "guy talk" and debate. He said he didn't consider SweeTalks to be like some of the more offensive shows.
"At the end of the day, you want to entertain the listeners and the viewers, so to do that you're going to have to say some crazy stuff," said Mr. Mendoza, who lives in Orange County, Calif. "Sometimes we'll say stuff, but we don't really fall in line with it. Sometimes we'll disagree on a topic just to have that argument with each other on the podcast and have different point of views."
Raymond Pang, a 31-year-old podcast producer and sound designer who works mostly on science shows, said he had never personally experienced romantic rejection because of his profession. In fact, he said, it was often a point of entry into conversation.
About a month ago he started seeing someone new, but while he was single, he presented himself as an audio producer. As someone who has also worked in public radio, he felt the audio label encompassed both jobs. "I feel like I have been able to position myself away from the terrible-man corner of podcasting," he said in an interview.
Mr. Pang said he didn't know of many people who work in audio who would call themselves "podcasters," though, given the unappealing idea that "anybody can be a podcaster."
"It could mean that you work at This American Life or it could mean that you record a podcast with a bunch of your friends to talk about the latest week of football games or something like that, or worse -- like, misogynistic stuff," he said.
For her part, Ms. Roberson, the Cal State student, said that after her experience she would never again date a man in podcasts: "Absolutely not."

The Film Studio A24 Buys the Cherry Lane Theater: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The studio's first venture into live performance follows the move by Audible, Amazon's audio subsidiary, to stage works at the nearby Minetta Lane Theater.
A24, the independent film and television studio barreling into next weekend's Academy Awards with a boatload of Oscar nominations, is making an unexpected move into live performance, purchasing a small Off Broadway theater in New York's West Village.
The studio, which until now has focused on making movies, television shows and podcasts, has purchased the Cherry Lane Theater for $ 10 million, and plans to present plays as well as other forms of live entertainment there, in addition to the occasional film screening.
A24, whose films include the leading Oscar contender "Everything Everywhere All at Once," is not the first film studio to make such a move: the Walt Disney Company has been presenting stage productions at Broadway's New Amsterdam Theater, which it leases from the state and city, since 1997. But Disney, of course, is an entertainment industry behemoth that has mastered the art of multiplatform storytelling.
A more comparable move, perhaps, was that by Audible, an Amazon audio subsidiary that since 2018 has been leasing the Minetta Lane Theater, in Greenwich Village, for live productions which it then records and offers on its digital platform. And Netflix, the streaming juggernaut, has in recent years taken over several cinemas, including the Paris Theater in New York, as well as the Egyptian and Bay theaters in Los Angeles.
The A24 acquisition, coming at a time when many theaters are still struggling to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, suggests a vote of confidence in live performance. A24 plans to present some events celebrating Cherry Lane's centennial this spring, and then to close the theater for renovations before beginning full-scale programming next year.
Much remains uncertain about how the company intends to use the theater. A24 declined to make anyone available to speak on the record about the acquisition, but an official there said that the company had not yet decided whether it would develop work for the stage, or present work developed by others. The official, who was granted anonymity to describe the company's plans, said that the studio hoped the theater would allow it to strengthen existing relationships with writers and performers who work on stage and screen, and to develop new relationships with comedians and theater artists.
A24 plans to retain the theater's existing staff while adding to it with its own team, the official said, and as part of the renovation it plans to install technology so the theater can be used for film screenings.
The official said A24's theater venture is a partnership with Taurus Investment Holdings.
"I really believe my theater is going into the right hands," said Angelina Fiordellisi, who has owned the theater since 1996. "They love to develop and produce the work of emerging writers, and a lot of their writers are playwrights. I can't imagine a better way to bring future life to the theater."
Fiordellisi, 68, has been trying to sell the theater for some time. "I don't want to work that hard anymore," she said, "and I want to spend more time with my family."
The purchase, which was previously reported by Curbed, includes three attached properties, including a 179-seat theater, a 60-seat theater and eight apartments, on the Village's picturesque, curving Commerce Street. The Cherry Lane, in a 19th-century building that was a brewery and a box factory before being converted to theatrical use in 1923, bills itself as the city's longest continually running Off Broadway theater.
In 2021, Fiordellisi agreed to sell the property to the Lucille Lortel Theater for $ 11 million, but the sale fell apart. Last week, Lortel announced that it had spent $ 5.3 million to purchase a three-story carriage house in Chelsea, where it plans to open a 61-seat theater in 2025. The Lortel organization also has a 295-seat theater in the West Village.
The Cherry Lane will now be a for-profit, commercial venture; Fiordellisi had operated it through a nonprofit, occasionally presenting work that she developed and more often renting it to nonprofit and commercial producers. Fiordellisi said she will convert her nonprofit to a foundation that will give grants to playwrights and small theater companies.

A Casual Guide to Paris Shopping

Paris is a city of easy pleasures. Wine, cheese, croissants. What’s not to love? Isn’t that what Netflix built the popularity of the très unrealistic “Emily in Paris” on? Except the thing about Paris is that it seems like a foolproof place, but it’s not. Rather, it is a city that rewards research.
Prioritize idiosyncratic shops. Paris is still the kind of place where you can stumble upon a boutique that sells only gloves or umbrellas. There is nothing better than being able to announce to anyone listening that you got some supple belt or slipper or lamp or toothpaste in Paris.
Definitely check on the hours that shops are open because they can be highly unusual from a New Yorker’s perspective. Some require appointments, but don’t be intimidated by that. Be enticed at the potential, the uniqueness, the fun.
Strategize your day by neighborhood groupings. In the morning, go to a few stores around, say, Place Vendôme, capped off with a lazy lunch and some of the all-time great people-watching at Hotel Costes. (A fun game: “Is that his daughter or his girlfriend?”) If you’re a real demon, move on to another neighborhood. Otherwise take a nap, then go to a small museum like Musée de la Chasse et de la Nature, which is like entering into a Wes Anderson film set.
Paris has many of the same designer boutiques as New York and other large cities, so you might skip them. However! Between the exchange rate and the VAT return (aka, tax refund), designer goods can be significantly cheaper. You’ll need your passport in store. At the airport, remember to scan the forms or have them stamped before you check in and go through customs, as sometimes they ask to see the goods in person. Basically, this is a crucial way to justify buying things.
Resee
This is an online consignment store, but you can make an appointment and send links of what you like, then try it all on at its showroom. Allow Matt, who runs the showroom, to bring you a coffee, and try on a Jil Sander paisley dress from when Raf Simons was the designer or an ivory Chanel jacket like the one in “The Devil Wears Prada” or a ruffled Prada blouse consigned by Catherine Deneuve.
Le Bon Marché
All grand (and less than grand) department stores owe their existences to this place. Émile Zola used it as the setting for “The Ladies Paradise,” in 1883. Here’s how I navigate it. I go to the lingerie-swimwear section. The Empreinte lingerie brand for large busts and plus sizes is hard to find in the United States but has the most comfortable and beautiful collections.
The second floor has a beauty section for niche brands, where you can buy hair masks and dental floss from brands you’ve never heard of. Then do a loop of the designer collections as an overview to see which ones speak to you. Go to, say, Dries Van Noten for an immersive experience. Go to the Buly counter for souvenirs, like a lip balm that comes in a box that can be embossed with initials. Buy snacks at the food hall across the street, which sells things like carrot-passion fruit jam and has at least three aisles dedicated to yogurt. Open Sundays!
Sabbia Rosa
If your ideal look is ’90s off-duty supermodel, this is your heaven. There are exquisite but extremely expensive handmade slips here. Everything can be custom-made, which is dangerous. Do not skip the satin mule slippers with the bow.
Monoprix
Monoprix is basically the French equivalent of Target. The organic cotton underwear comes in a ribbed culotte — a bikini style — or culotte haute, which is more like granny panties. They’re not dissimilar to the handmade underwear from Zimmerli or Hanro but around five euros. Stock up on Savon de Marseille hand soap and filet à provisions, those net market bags.
Em Archives
This new vintage showroom made a cameo in the Blackbird Spyplane newsletter. On a recent visit, it had at least one oversize Donna Karan blouse, an Hermès blazer, Comme des Garçons flats from 1997 and several pairs of Jil Sander trousers at extremely competitive prices.
Flea Market
There are several flea markets in Paris, but the largest is the Puces de Paris Saint-Ouen at the northern border of the city. The place is gigantic, so you absolutely need some kind of strategy. Choose a category (a friend had great luck looking for antique tablecloths) or pick one area to browse. The Marché Paul Bert Serpette is my favorite and has a mix of furniture and clothes.
Will you find a deal? Maybe. Will you want to buy a chair and ship it home? Absolutely! There are shipping companies on site, or just build it a box and check it as oversize luggage on a flight home. For something easier to take home, De Laurentis has late ’80s and early ’90s European and Japanese minimalist designer clothes, and Chantal has beaded flapper dresses reminiscent of the first Bode women’s collection.
Charvet
Who doesn’t want to authentically dress like Lydia Tár these days? This is a multistory palace of tailoring. Get the slippers, get a striped nightshirt that can be worn as a dress, maybe get a rosette brooch made out of necktie material. Then cross to the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz for a cocktail. It’s sort of like the Bemelmans Bar of Paris.
La Tuile à Loup
Maybe its stern but direct Instagram bio says it all: “Finest of handmade tableware. MADE IN FRANCE. International shipping available.” Do you want a vase with a jellyfish on it? Or how about a marbled tray? Maybe all you need to know is that Ina Garten was recently photographed there. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Humanity's Past, Ripe for Further Ridicule: [Review]

Full text: Mel Brooks's human comedy gets a 'Part II' for streaming TV, with a sketch-star cast and a sharp makeover.
Before his many lives as America's tummler-in-chief -- movie star, director, Broadway producer -- Mel Brooks was a TV guy. He wrote for Sid Caesar's "Your Show of Shows," the Big Bang from which much of the TV comedic tradition exploded forth. His 1981 film, "History of the World, Part I" (in which Caesar appeared as a cave dweller), applied an episodic approach, as if it were meant to be a sketch-comedy series.
Now, with a little help and a few changes, it is. The eight-part "History of the World, Part II," which debuts two episodes a day from Monday through Thursday on Hulu, is a screwball tour of civilization that gives the Brooks formula enough contemporary updates that you could think of it as "Evolution of TV Comedy, Part I."
And in an era of dutiful brand extensions and pointless revivals, it turns out to be history that's surprisingly worth repeating.
The 96-year-old Brooks is a writer and producer of the new series and assumes the narrator role performed by Orson Welles in the film. He has limited screen time now -- the heaviest lifting is done by the writer-producer-performers Ike Barinholtz, Nick Kroll and Wanda Sykes -- but he is responsible for the show's first sight gag, in which he's digitally altered into a young, musclebound hunk.
Like that image, "Part II" aims not simply to reproduce the Mel Brooks of the last century but also to bring his comedy into 2023. It's a collaborative production (the cast is so vast it might be easier to list TV-comedy fixtures who don't appear) that is more diverse in both faces and comedy styles. Beyond the callbacks to the movie and affectionate recreations of Brooks's slapstick and Jewish humor, the series combines elements of "Kroll Show," "Drunk History," "Documentary Now!," "Sherman's Showcase" and more.
"Part I" was less a parody of actual history than of movie history. Its ancient Rome was lifted from swords-and-sandals epics; its French Revolution was, as the New York Times critic Vincent Canby wrote, very much the one imagined in M.G.M.'s "A Tale of Two Cities."
"Part II" is thoroughly made of TV and pop-media references. The story of Jesus Christ begins with a dead-on parody of "Curb Your Enthusiasm," with Kroll as a Larry Davidian Judas riffing with J.B. Smoove as the apostle Luke; later it becomes a drawn-out sendup of the Beatles documentary "Get Back."
"Part II" is hit-and-miss, much like "Part I" and nearly every sketch comedy ever made. When it hits, it's an almost perfect marriage of style and subject. The strongest extended sketch stars Sykes as Shirley Chisholm -- the Black female congresswoman and 1972 presidential candidate -- in a note-perfect sendup of a '70s sitcom. It's not just impeccably executed and detailed, it's sharp, smart history, accented with the laughter of a "live Black audience."
When the show misses -- well, another advantage streaming has over the movie theater is the fast-forward button. A running bit about Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (Barinholtz) trying to kick his booze habit starts off strong with Timothy Simons as a cranky Abraham Lincoln but becomes a grinding war of attrition. The limp gag of imagining historical figures on social media (Galileo, Typhoid Mary, Princess Anastasia) doesn't improve with repetition.
There's also the occasional reminder of the changed cultural sensibilities that "Part II" was made for. Brooks was a yukmeister provocateur, who made fun of the horrors of the 20th century (and beyond) while trusting his audience to get the absurdity. His "The Producers" -- about the making of a deliberately offensive musical about Hitler -- was about that kind of trust backfiring, and it generated backlash in real life.
But as Brooks said on "Fresh Air" last year, "If we're going to get even with Hitler, we can't get on a soapbox because he's too damn good at that." (I guess I should note that Brooks is Jewish, even if that's news only to Homer Simpson.) In that spirit, the closing credits of "Part I" tease a sequel including the segment "Hitler on Ice." It's assumed that the audience, without nudging, sees the ridiculousness of showing a genocidal monster pirouetting on skates.
The first episode of "Part II" turns that brief joke into a full sketch with Barinholtz, Kroll and Sykes as sports announcers. Through the routine, their insults of the Nazi skater -- "He's a thug and bad for the sport" -- grow sharper and more vulgar, as if to make clear that the depiction does not equal endorsement. It's a funny bit, too, but funny for a more cautious, earnest time that prefers its problematic comedy more clearly underlined and bracketed.
One advantage "Part II" has over its movie predecessor is the freedom of small scale. It can execute a one-joke premise and get out fast, as when it has Johnny Knoxville play the famously hard-to-kill czarist adviser Rasputin as the star of a Russian "Jackass." (This also distinguishes it from Netflix's "Cunk on Earth," which can be screamingly funny but is condemned to repeat its Ali G-esque joke a little too long.)
Still, "Part II" doesn't entirely forget where it came from. A series of musical sketches featuring Kroll as a Jewish peasant selling mud pies during the Russian Revolution is the most Brooksian in style and setting. In a showstopping number, Kroll and Pamela Adlon fend off a murderous Cossack neighbor and duet about the trade-offs of city vs. shtetl life. ("Why seek out death and fear? / We've got plenty of it here!")
It's just the dish to celebrate Mel Brooks's legacy: Mud pie, à la mode.

A24, an Indie Film Studio, Buys New York’s Cherry Lane Theater

NEW YORK — A24, an independent film and television studio barreling into next weekend’s Academy Awards with a boatload of Oscar nominations, is making an unexpected move into live performance, purchasing a small off-Broadway theater in New York’s West Village.

Last week, Lortel announced it had spent $5.3 million to purchase a three-story carriage house in Chelsea, where it plans to open a 61-seat theater in 2025. The Lortel organization also has a 295-seat theater in the West Village.
The Cherry Lane will now be a for-profit, commercial venture; Fiordellisi had operated it through a nonprofit, occasionally presenting work that she developed and more often renting it to nonprofit and commercial producers. Fiordellisi said she will convert her nonprofit to a foundation that will give grants to playwrights and small theater companies. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The White House is at odds with business leaders over share repurchase programs. DealBook digs into the numbers to see who's gaining from the practice.
Buyback now, profit later?
Share buybacks provided plenty of big headlines this week.
The Biden administration seems ready to pick a fight with any firm looking to set aside billions for such megapurchases. The White House and some Democrats would rather C.E.O.s use the money to reinvest in their businesses -- that would lead to stronger firms, more jobs and better returns for investors, the thinking goes. They also feel buybacks disproportionately enrich managers at the expense of employees. In his State of the Union address, President Biden called for quadrupling the tax on share repurchases.
Warren Buffett isn't buying that argument. In his annual letter to shareholders, the billionaire C.E.O. of Berkshire Hathaway said to beware the buyback detractor -- who is either an "economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue."
Who's right? DealBook reviewed the research and spoke to buyback experts. Here's what we found:
Buybacks can be a boon for investors. According to Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America, investors tend to reward companies that execute repurchases by, yep, buying more stock. Over the past five years, share prices went up for nearly 55 percent of the 2,997 companies tracked by Bank of America that repurchased shares.
More evidence supporting buybacks:
Repurchases signal to Wall Street that the company has a healthy balance sheet, and that attracts more investor interest, said Luis Garcia-Feijoo, research director at the CFA Institute Research Foundation. Exhibit A: Salesforce's shares soared on Thursday after the company announced that it would buy back $ 20 billion worth of shares. Exhibit B: Meta's stock also spiked when it made a similar announcement last month.
Investors tend to view buybacks more favorably than dividends. One reason: The former tend to carry a relatively light or imperceptible tax hit, Mr. Garcia-Feijoo said.
Buybacks don't work for all companies. (Even Mr. Buffett admits this.) Shareholders tend to punish companies that repurchase shares that are already too pricey. Subramanian calculates that the 50 biggest companies in the S&P 500 are overvalued. For them, buybacks don't make as much sense.
Companies may be buying back too many shares. Companies announced plans to buy more than $ 1.2 trillion of their own stock last year and could come close to, or surpass, that this year. Firms are spending roughly 90 percent of their earnings on buybacks and dividends, according to Bharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the National Economic Council. Some market pros are having second thoughts, too. In a December survey of global fund managers by Bank of America, 56 percent said they would prefer that the C.E.O. used excess funds to shore up the balance sheet; just 16 percent said they wanted to see more buybacks.
The verdict? According to Mr. Garcia-Feijoo, a prevailing view is emerging: "Buybacks are not so bad." Mr. Buffett wins the argument, he says.
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Dilbert gets a pink slip. Hundreds of newspapers cut the cartoon strip that mocks office culture after its creator, Scott Adams, described Black people as a "hate group" and said white people should "just get the hell away from them." Mr. Adams said he was using hyperbole and complained that he had been "canceled." Not quite -- he is still able to publish content, even if most media outlets want nothing to do with him.
Netflix goes live. The streaming platform announced two firsts: a livestreamed Chris Rock stand-up comedy show and a live stage production, "Stranger Things: The First Shadow," to be held in London this year. The company previously experimented with immersive experiences linked to franchises including "Bridgerton," "Squid Game" and "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery."
Tick Tock for TikTok. The Chinese short video app introduced a one-hour time limit for users who are under 18. The move was announced days after the Biden administration, Canada and the European Union banned the social media powerhouse from government phones over concerns that the company may put sensitive information in the hands of the Chinese government.
Salesforce discovers its profit motive. The software group, grappling with six activist investors, reported better-than-expected earnings, sending its share price soaring. Marc Benioff, the C.E.O., was joyful in a round of interviews with journalists and on a call with analysts. He said Salesforce was now putting a priority on profits and efficiency over growth. (A nonchalant admission that raises the question: What took it so long?)
The newsmaker: Nir Bar Dea
Bridgewater's C.E.O., Nir Bar Dea, unveiled a long-awaited revamp of the world's biggest hedge fund this week, five months after its founder, Ray Dalio, ceded control. The sweeping changes include expanding in Asia, cutting nearly 8 percent of its work force and capping the size of its flagship Pure Alpha fund to $ 70 billion.
A new C.E.O. for a new era. "I know for a lot of people -- I'm not necessarily what they would be expecting," Bar Dea told Bloomberg last year. "I don't sound like it, look like it, the role of the C.E.O. of Bridgewater." In 2020, Fortune named Mr. Bar Dea one of its "40 Under 40" in finance.
Mr. Bar Dea's grandparents are from Libya, Poland and Hungary. He grew up in Israel and says the country's transformation underpins his own ambition. "I saw a nation be built almost from the ground up in my lifetime," he told Forbes.
Previous experience: the army, diplomacy and start-ups. Mr. Bar Dea was a platoon leader in the Israeli Defense Forces. He later founded a drone company and has said shutting it down was one of the most formative events of his career. Mr. Bar Dea later ran real estate for a restaurant company called Dishes, and in 2014 he took a role as adviser and speechwriter to the Israeli mission to the United Nations. He has an M.B.A. from Wharton.
Mr. Bar Dea arrived at a pivotal moment. He joined Bridgewater in 2015 after being contacted by Karen Karniol-Tambour, a co-chief investment officer, and started as a management associate in the research and analytics unit -- just as the firm was beginning to plan for a future without its founder. When he came to Bridgewater, he said, that's when "the journey of transitioning," began. "It was the beginning of thinking about how we're going to transition our investment oversight from Ray Dalio to the next generation."
$ 300 million
-- London's high-end property watchers are agog over a palatial mansion that just went on the market. Its sale could set a record, fetching as much as 250 million pounds ( $ 300 million). The crown for most expensive London property is held by a Chinese billionaire property developer who bought a mansion overlooking Hyde Park for £210 million in 2020. Move fast -- bids are already pouring in on the Regent's Park abode.
Fed watching
In the early days of the Covid pandemic, the Federal Reserve pulled out all the stops. It slashed the prime lending rate to near zero and spent roughly $ 5 trillion buying up Treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities and pumping liquidity into America's banking system.
The moves helped limit the pandemic's economic toll and ignited a bull market stock rally that carried the mantra "Don't fight the Fed." In her new book, "Limitless: The Federal Reserve Takes On a New Age of Crisis," The Times's Jeanna Smialek takes on, and demystifies, the world's most powerful central bank. The interview has been edited and condensed:
What is the party pitch for a book on central banking?
The Fed matters to you, to your life, to markets, your retirement portfolio, and it increasingly matters for our democratic system of capitalism.
Why is the Fed especially important right now?
The Fed really expanded its footprint during the 2008 financial crisis and especially in 2020 during the pandemic. It has been doing things that extend beyond traditional monetary policy.
Is this a positive evolution?
It's almost a historic inevitability in response to changing circumstances. But the institution has a lot of power and few checks on it, and there may be a point when we decide there should be more firm limits. We should be watching and talking about what it's doing and where we're going.
What risks does it face?
Efforts to politicize the Fed, particularly. There have been similar efforts since its founding, but the risks are greater now because it has so much power.
How will it respond to the next crisis?
What we tend to see is that once it uses a tool, it could use it again even though it may have been touted as "once in a lifetime." In the pandemic, the Fed created a local government lending facility, which was very unusual and had never been done. We might see that again.
What do you wish more people would consider?
Ten years ago, none of us were paying much attention to the Supreme Court as it was becoming a more important force in society. We're at the same point with the Fed. We should not wait to understand it.
On our radar: Artifact
Built by the co-founders of Instagram, Artifact is an app that aims to do for text what TikTok has done for video: learn what users (with the help of artificial intelligence), and serve up a personalized feed of news articles and posts. Its main tab is even called "For You."
In some ways, it's a modern twist on aggregated news feeds like Google Reader (R.I.P.). Over several days of testing -- the app was made publicly available late last month -- Artifact has slowly begun to learn what might be of interest, though its guesses haven't always been perfect.

Bullying Claims Overshadow Careers of Athletes and Stars in South Korea: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In South Korea, such allegations have affected the careers of public figures. The takedowns have public support, but critics wonder if some go too far.
An Woo-jin, 23, is one of the top pitchers in South Korea. In 2022, he led the Korea Baseball Organization, the country's top league, in earned run average and strikeouts. But the K.B.O. didn't invite him to play in the World Baseball Classic, an international tournament featuring Major League Baseball stars that begins next week.
The K.B.O. has said it excluded Mr. An, who has been dogged by anonymous accusations that he assaulted his teammates while in high school, because it considers him a reputational liability. He was not considered last year for an award given to the K.B.O.'s best pitcher because of those accusations.
No charges have ever been filed, and Mr. An has said that news reports about his bullying, for which he apologized at the time, were exaggerated. Yet many South Koreans, including baseball fans, have said they support his exclusion.
Over the last two decades, public accusations of school bullying and violence have played an increasingly prominent role in South Korean culture -- Netflix even has a hit show on the subject, "The Glory." Entertainment agencies vet would-be pop stars for evidence of bullying in their pasts.
Last week, President Yoon Suk Yeol withdrew the appointment of Jung Soon-shin as chief of the National Office of Investigation in response to reports that Mr. Jung's son had verbally harassed a high school classmate in 2017, and that Mr. Jung had defended him instead of holding him accountable.
Many South Koreans believe that bullies have damaged victims' lives in an irreversible way, said Jihoon Kim, a criminologist at the University of Alabama who has studied bullying in South Korea. "The idea of damaging the career of a bully is not seen as problematic, as they are seen as deserving it," he said.
Takedowns of accused bullies remain popular, despite concerns about accountability and credibility, given that in many cases the accusations are anonymous. Critics have also questioned whether the harm done to reputations is disproportionate to the offenses.
A national conversation around school bullying began taking shape in the 1990s, after several teenage targets of such abuse died by suicide. A 2004 law to prevent bullying was widely considered a moment of reckoning, but a severe lack of mental health services for bullies and their victims has persisted, said Jun Sung Hong, a professor of social work at Wayne State University who has written about bullying in South Korea.
Penalties for bullying in South Korea tend to be less severe than in the United States. There, school harassment is frequently grounds for suspension or expulsion, while many South Korean schools just impose community service or a restraining order, said Noh Yoon Ho, a lawyer in Seoul who has advised bullying victims.
Still, Ms. Noh said, more victims and bystanders have been reporting school bullying, and the institutional mechanisms for doing so have improved. In a government survey, 91 percent of people who said they experienced bullying last year reported it, compared with 78 percent in 2014.
As people have come forward with old bullying accusations, some have identified public figures, including athletes and entertainers, as perpetrators.
In 2021, two professional volleyball players, the twin sisters Lee Jae-yeong and Lee Da-yeong, then 24 years old, were cut from their Korean clubs after they admitted to having verbally abused their teammates in middle school. That prompted a spate of bullying accusations against other athletes and a plea by then-President Moon Jae-in for the Culture Ministry to "make special efforts to eradicate the problem."
Last year, Hybe, the agency behind the boy band BTS, kicked out Kim Ga-ram from its nascent girl group Le Sserafim, after anonymous accusers said the singer had verbally abused them. Hybe threatened to sue her accusers for defamation, but later ended Ms. Kim's contract after a law firm representing one of the accusers threatened to publicly release evidence.
Victims might choose anonymity out of fear that public accusations could prompt retaliation from the former bullies or their allies, Ms. Noh said. But some anonymous accusations circulating in the South Korean news media are less than they seem.
After the comedian Hong Hyun-hee was accused two years ago in an online post of having been a school bully, former classmates of hers denied the accusation, and she filed a defamation lawsuit. Her accuser later withdrew the post and apologized for having a "memory lapse," Ms. Hong's agency said.
Other critics say that the takedowns can be too punitive. Case in point: the pitcher, An Woo-jin.
Mr. An's troubles began in 2017, when a TV network reported that he had assaulted younger players on his high school team.
The police determined that Mr. An, then 17, had hit three younger students in the head with a baseball, a cellphone and a belt buckle, and a fourth student on the shin with a bat, according to police records provided by his lawyer. After the students decided not to file charges, saying that Mr. An's behavior had not been severe, prosecutors dropped the case.
The allegations against Mr. An, a 6-foot-3 right-hander who throws 99-mile-per-hour fastballs, did not stop him from going professional the same year. The Kiwoom Heroes signed him for 600 million won, or about $ 470,000. No new accusations of bullying have emerged.
But the claims continue to shadow his career.
In 2017, the Korea Baseball Softball Association, which governs its national teams, barred him from the Olympics and the Asian Games. In January, the Korea Baseball Organization, which selects the team for the World Baseball Classic, said he would not take part in the tournament, which starts Tuesday.
The team was selected with an eye toward "the symbolic meaning, responsibility and price that comes with representing the country," the organization's spokesman, Lee Kyong-ho, said in an interview. "Is it right to select players based only on their skills?"
Fueling public anger is a perception that the penalties Mr. An's high school imposed -- five hours of volunteer work and a written apology -- were too light. But Mr. An's lawyer, Baek Sung-moon, said in an interview that the decision to ban him from international tournaments had apparently been based on an impression that his bullying was harsher than reported.
"He has had a hard time being viewed as some kind of a school bullying demon," he added.
Mr. An's defenders include Shin-Soo Choo, an outfielder who played 16 years in the majors and now plays in the K.B.O. He said last month that "South Koreans don't seem to easily forgive."
"He repented his mistakes, got punished and was suspended from tournaments," Mr. Choo told a Korean-language station in Dallas, adding that Mr. An's talents could make him "the next Chan Ho Park," an All-Star pitcher who was the first South Korean-born M.L.B. player.
But many critics of Mr. An have taken issue with Mr. Choo's efforts to stand up for him. Among them is Mr. Park himself, who retired from baseball in 2012.
"An Woo-jin's exclusion from the W.B.C. national team was a reflection of the times," he told reporters on a visit to the Heroes' spring training camp in Scottsdale, Ariz.
"I told him not to be so sad," he added.

The West Tried to Isolate Russia. It Didn't Work.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After Russia invaded Ukraine, the West formed what looked like an overwhelming global coalition -- 141 countries supported a United Nations measure demanding that Russia unconditionally withdraw.
By contrast, Russia seemed isolated. North Korea was one of only four countries that backed Russia and rejected the measure.
But the West never won over as much of the world as it initially seemed. Another 47 countries abstained or missed the vote, including India and China. Many of those "neutral" nations have since provided crucial economic or diplomatic support for Russia.
And even some of the nations that initially agreed to denounce Russia see the war as somebody else's problem -- and have since started moving toward a more neutral position.
A year on, it's becoming clearer: While the West's core coalition remains remarkably solid, it never convinced the rest of the world to isolate Russia.
Instead of cleaving in two, the world has fragmented. A vast middle sees Russia's invasion as, primarily, a European and American problem. Rather than view it as an existential threat, these countries are largely focused on protecting their own interests amid the economic and geopolitical upheaval caused by the invasion.
Today's landscape evokes the Cold War's many neutral states. But the world is now even more interconnected. The scale and complexity of global communications, economic ties and security links offer far more opportunities for the West's rivals to gain leverage.
Last week, the U.N. General Assembly endorsed another resolution demanding that Russia withdraw from Ukraine's territory -- but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south continued to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regard as the West's war.
Here is how Russia is taking advantage. Getting around sanctions
At first, the West's economic sanctions seemed like they might undermine Moscow's ability to sustain the war. An American-led campaign, which included 37 countries, rattled the foundations of Russia's financial system by freezing its foreign-currency reserves and targeting its main banks.
The sanctions blocked key imports like spare parts for aircraft and semiconductors for electronics. And hundreds of companies voluntarily stopped doing business in Russia, leaving regular Russians without Apple retailers or Netflix subscriptions.
But the sanctions have not been as devastating as the West had hoped. A handful of countries have filled the gap, increasing exports to Russia well above prewar levels, according to data collected by Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington nonprofit. Other countries' exports decreased when the war began but have since reversed course.
China and Turkey made up most of the export gap on their own.
Chinese passenger vehicles replaced Russia's past supply from Western manufacturers. China exported more machinery and semiconductors, too. Other goods produced by multinational firms that can no longer be exported directly to Russia are now flowing through post-Soviet states.
Even as Turkey has sold weapons to Ukraine, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has opened up an increased flow of goods to Russia, tearing a hole in the Western dam of sanctions.
"We have always maintained a policy of balance between Ukraine and Russia," Mr. Erdogan said in September, six months after Turkey voted with the United States to denounce Russia's invasion.
Altogether, after initially falling post-invasion, trade levels have rebounded because enough countries remain willing to trade with Russia.
The sanctions could still be devastating to Russia in the long term. They are already stunting foreign investment and starting to drain the government's coffers. Restrictions on oil trading have forced Russia to cut production. And reorienting the country's natural gas pipeline infrastructure toward Asia will take years.
But even though Russia's economy isn't thriving, it's strong enough to keep the war going. The International Monetary Fund projected last month that the Russian economy would grow by 0.3 percent this year, a sharp improvement from its previous estimate that it would contract by 2.3 percent. Buying weapons and components
The United States and its partners have been dispatching ever more lethal weapons and military equipment directly to Ukraine. And they have attempted to cut off Russia's own supply of military equipment by imposing export controls that prohibit many companies from selling critical technology to Russia.
The weapons have helped Ukraine surprise the world and hold off Russia's much larger military. At least 40 countries have provided military aid to Ukraine, either by sending offensive weapons or by providing other forms of military aid.
But the effort to deprive Russia of military equipment has been less successful. Russia has found help here, too. North Korea has shipped "a significant number" of artillery shells to Russia, the United States has said. Iran has provided Russia with unmanned "kamikaze" drones that Moscow has deployed for attacks against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.
And other countries, including China, have continued to supply Russia with dual-use goods like microchips that make their way into military equipment.
To be sure, analysts say Russia does appear to be facing a shortage of precision weaponry, like cruise missiles, that require high-tech equipment. And Russian soldiers report a lack of night-vision equipment and surveillance drones on the front line. Taking advantage of global ambivalence
A lot of world leaders don't particularly like the idea of one country invading another. But many of them aren't unhappy to see somebody stand up to the United States, either.
Throughout Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, many governments with strong official ties to the United States and Europe don't see the war as a global threat. Instead, they've positioned themselves as neutral bystanders or arbiters, preserving as much flexibility as they can. ASIA
Reaction to the invasion was mixed in Asia, where more than a third of countries declined to condemn Russia in the initial U.N. vote. While most American allies have fallen in line, Russia has been able to take advantage of trade relationships and friendly public opinion dating to the Cold War.
At the beginning of the invasion, the United States asked India to buy less oil from Russia. Since then, it has softened its stance as India has continually defied alignment with either side. As tensions increase along India's border with China, experts have said India doesn't feel it can risk its relationship with Russia -- a key source for weapons.
Gulf countries voted alongside the West to condemn Russia, but they have since largely sought to be seen as neutral arbiters.
President Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates traveled to Russia to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin and said he sought to find a diplomatic solution. He also offered up an Abu Dhabi airfield for the Brittney Griner prisoner exchange.
Dubai, in particular, has become a hub for Russians -- a haven for oligarchs and pro-Kremlin elites where Western sanctions cannot reach. And Saudi Arabia has said it must pursue its own interests, even if that causes friction in its longstanding relationship with the United States. AFRICA
Nearly half of African countries abstained or were absent from the vote to condemn Russia, suggesting a growing reluctance in many nations to accept an American narrative of right and wrong. Russia has won friends through relentless propaganda and hard power, with a growing number of countries contracting with Russian mercenaries and buying Russian weapons.
In South Africa, ties to Russia go back to Soviet support to end apartheid. Its leaders have seen an opportunity to align more closely with Russia, while filling in trade gaps left by Europe and the United States. But like many other African countries, South Africa appears careful to balance its growing ties with Russia against maintaining a relationship with the West. THE AMERICAS
Latin America, with its longstanding relationships with the United States, voted largely alongside its northern neighbor to condemn Russia. But cracks have begun to show more prominently in recent months.
Colombia recently refused a request from the United States to provide weapons to Ukraine. And when visited by Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany last month, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil declined to speak in support of Ukraine, saying, "I think the reason for the war between Russia and Ukraine needs to be clearer." Trying to weaken the core Western coalition
Several dozen countries make up the core group backing Ukraine by providing military assistance or sanctioning Russia.
Western unity during the war has proved remarkable, with countries long seen as relatively friendly toward Russia -- like Germany, France and Italy -- remaining staunchly behind Ukraine. NATO, described as experiencing "brain death" by President Emmanuel Macron of France in 2019, once again serves the clear purpose of protecting the Western alliance from Russian attack.
But even among Western countries, the unity has not been perfect. Hungary has technically sanctioned Russia as a member of the European Union, but under leader Viktor Orban it has been a persistent outlier in support for Ukraine within the E.U. Hungary delayed several E.U. decisions that required unanimous support.
Others that provided Ukraine with military support have declined to impose economic sanctions on Russia.
And a much smaller group of countries have done everything: imposed sanctions, provided heavy weapons -- such as tanks, armored vehicles and air defense missile systems -- and committed at least 0.1 percent of G.D.P. as bilateral aid to Ukraine, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
As the war passes the one-year mark, Russia's strategy is clear: to wait out the West. Eventually, Mr. Putin is betting, European countries worried about the war's toll on their economies and their politics will drop their support for sanctions and weapons deliveries. Countries across Asia, the Middle East and Africa that are already neutral in the conflict will continue to increase trade with Russia.
And perhaps even the United States, with its presidential election next year, will tire of war and will pressure Ukraine to give in to Mr. Putin.
How unified the West can remain -- and how much of the world it is able to keep at least partly on its side -- could well determine the outcome of the conflict.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, the West formed what looked like an overwhelming global coalition — 141 countries supported a United Nations measure demanding that Russia unconditionally withdraw.
By contrast, Russia seemed isolated. North Korea was one of only four countries that backed Russia and rejected the measure.
But the West never won over as much of the world as it initially seemed. Another 47 countries abstained or missed the vote, including India and China. Many of those “neutral” nations have since provided crucial economic or diplomatic support for Russia.
And even some of the nations that initially agreed to denounce Russia see the war as somebody else’s problem — and have since started moving toward a more neutral position.
A year on, it’s becoming clearer: While the West’s core coalition remains remarkably solid, it never convinced the rest of the world to isolate Russia.
Instead of cleaving in two, the world has fragmented. A vast middle sees Russia’s invasion as, primarily, a European and American problem. Rather than view it as an existential threat, these countries are largely focused on protecting their own interests amid the economic and geopolitical upheaval caused by the invasion.
Today’s landscape evokes the Cold War’s many neutral states. But the world is now even more interconnected. The scale and complexity of global communications, economic ties and security links offer far more opportunities for the West’s rivals to gain leverage.
Last week, the U.N. General Assembly endorsed another resolution demanding that Russia withdraw from Ukraine’s territory — but China, South Africa, India and many countries in the global south continued to abstain, underlining their alienation from what they regard as the West’s war.
Here is how Russia is taking advantage.
Getting Around Sanctions
At first, the West’s economic sanctions seemed like they might undermine Moscow’s ability to sustain the war. An American-led campaign, which included 37 countries, rattled the foundations of Russia’s financial system by freezing its foreign-currency reserves and targeting its main banks.
The sanctions blocked key imports such as spare parts for aircraft and semiconductors for electronics. And hundreds of companies voluntarily stopped doing business in Russia, leaving regular Russians without Apple retailers or Netflix subscriptions.
But the sanctions have not been as devastating as the West had hoped. A handful of countries have filled the gap, increasing exports to Russia well above prewar levels, according to data collected by Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington nonprofit. Other countries’ exports decreased when the war began but have since reversed course.
China and Turkey made up most of the export gap on their own.
Chinese passenger vehicles replaced Russia’s past supply from Western manufacturers. China exported more machinery and semiconductors, too. Other goods produced by multinational firms that can no longer be exported directly to Russia are now flowing through post-Soviet states.
Even as Turkey has sold weapons to Ukraine, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has opened up an increased flow of goods to Russia, tearing a hole in the Western dam of sanctions.
“We have always maintained a policy of balance between Ukraine and Russia,” Erdogan said in September, six months after Turkey voted with the United States to denounce Russia’s invasion.
Altogether, after initially falling post-invasion, trade levels have rebounded because enough countries remain willing to trade with Russia.
The sanctions could still be devastating to Russia in the long term. They are already stunting foreign investment and starting to drain the government’s coffers. Restrictions on oil trading have forced Russia to cut production. And reorienting the country’s natural gas pipeline infrastructure toward Asia will take years.
But even though Russia’s economy isn’t thriving, it’s strong enough to keep the war going. The International Monetary Fund projected last month that the Russian economy would grow by 0.3% this year, a sharp improvement from its previous estimate that it would contract by 2.3%.
Buying Weapons and Components
The United States and its partners have been dispatching ever more lethal weapons and military equipment directly to Ukraine. And they have attempted to cut off Russia’s own supply of military equipment by imposing export controls that prohibit many companies from selling critical technology to Russia.
The weapons have helped Ukraine surprise the world and hold off Russia’s much larger military. At least 40 countries have provided military aid to Ukraine, either by sending offensive weapons or by providing other forms of military aid.
But the effort to deprive Russia of military equipment has been less successful. Russia has found help here, too. North Korea has shipped “a significant number” of artillery shells to Russia, the United States has said. Iran has provided Russia with unmanned “kamikaze” drones that Moscow has deployed for attacks against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.
And other countries, including China, have continued to supply Russia with dual-use goods like microchips that make their way into military equipment.
To be sure, analysts say Russia does appear to be facing a shortage of precision weaponry, like cruise missiles, that require high-tech equipment. And Russian soldiers report a lack of night-vision equipment and surveillance drones on the front line.
Taking Advantage of Global Ambivalence
A lot of world leaders don’t particularly like the idea of one country invading another. But many of them aren’t unhappy to see somebody stand up to the United States, either.
Throughout Africa, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, many governments with strong official ties to the United States and Europe don’t see the war as a global threat. Instead, they’ve positioned themselves as neutral bystanders or arbiters, preserving as much flexibility as they can.
ASIA
Reaction to the invasion was mixed in Asia, where more than one-third of countries declined to condemn Russia in the initial U.N. vote. While most American allies have fallen in line, Russia has been able to take advantage of trade relationships and friendly public opinion dating to the Cold War.
At the beginning of the invasion, the United States asked India to buy less oil from Russia. Since then, it has softened its stance as India has continually defied alignment with either side. As tensions increase along India’s border with China, experts have said India doesn’t feel it can risk its relationship with Russia — a key source for weapons.
Gulf countries voted alongside the West to condemn Russia, but they have since largely sought to be seen as neutral arbiters.
President Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates traveled to Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin and said he sought to find a diplomatic solution. He also offered up an Abu Dhabi airfield for the Brittney Griner prisoner exchange.
Dubai, in particular, has become a hub for Russians — a haven for oligarchs and pro-Kremlin elites where Western sanctions cannot reach. And Saudi Arabia has said it must pursue its own interests, even if that causes friction in its long-standing relationship with the United States.
AFRICA
Nearly half of African countries abstained or were absent from the vote to condemn Russia, suggesting a growing reluctance in many nations to accept an American narrative of right and wrong. Russia has won friends through relentless propaganda and hard power, with a growing number of countries contracting with Russian mercenaries and buying Russian weapons.
In South Africa, ties to Russia go back to Soviet support to end apartheid. Its leaders have seen an opportunity to align more closely with Russia, while filling in trade gaps left by Europe and the United States. But like many other African countries, South Africa appears careful to balance its growing ties with Russia against maintaining a relationship with the West.
THE AMERICAS
Latin America, with its long-standing relationships with the United States, voted largely alongside its northern neighbor to condemn Russia. But cracks have begun to show more prominently in recent months.
Colombia recently refused a request from the United States to provide weapons to Ukraine. And when visited by Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany last month, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil declined to speak in support of Ukraine, saying, “I think the reason for the war between Russia and Ukraine needs to be clearer.”
Trying to Weaken the Core Western Coalition
Several dozen countries make up the core group backing Ukraine by providing military assistance or sanctioning Russia.
Western unity during the war has proved remarkable, with countries long seen as relatively friendly toward Russia — like Germany, France and Italy — remaining staunchly behind Ukraine. NATO, described as experiencing “brain death” by President Emmanuel Macron of France in 2019, once again serves the clear purpose of protecting the Western alliance from Russian attack.
But even among Western countries, the unity has not been perfect. Hungary has technically sanctioned Russia as a member of the European Union, but under leader Viktor Orban it has been a persistent outlier in support for Ukraine within the EU. Hungary delayed several EU decisions that required unanimous support.
Others that provided Ukraine with military support have declined to impose economic sanctions on Russia.
And a much smaller group of countries have done everything: imposed sanctions, provided heavy weapons — such as tanks, armored vehicles and air defense missile systems — and committed at least 0.1% of gross domestic product as bilateral aid to Ukraine, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
As the war passes the one-year mark, Russia’s strategy is clear: to wait out the West. Eventually, Putin is betting, European countries worried about the war’s toll on their economies and their politics will drop their support for sanctions and weapons deliveries. Countries across Asia, the Middle East and Africa that are already neutral in the conflict will continue to increase trade with Russia.
And perhaps even the United States, with its presidential election next year, will tire of war and will pressure Ukraine to give in to Putin.
How unified the West can remain — and how much of the world it is able to keep at least partly on its side — could well determine the outcome of the conflict. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

When On-Screen Heat Rises, She Helps Control the Temperature: [National Desk]

Full text: "Transforming Spaces" is a series about women driving change in sometimes unexpected places.
It takes a lot of people to make a movie. You've got the director for overall vision, the gaffer on the lights, the set decorators to add texture to the film's world, and the costume designers to envision the actors' looks.
And when those costumes come off and things start to get a bit steamy? That's where Jessica Steinrock comes in.
Ms. Steinrock is an intimacy coordinator -- or intimacy director, when she's working on theater and live performance -- who facilitates the production of scenes involving nudity, simulated sex or hyper exposure, which she defines as "something someone might not otherwise uncover in public, even if it's not legally nudity." Much like a stunt coordinator or a fight director, she makes sure that the actors are safe throughout the process, and that the scene looks believable.
The role has come to prominence in the last five years. As the entertainment industry reeled from the litany of abuses brought to light by the #MeToo movement, many productions were eager to publicly demonstrate their commitment to safety. Hiring an intimacy coordinator was one way to do that.
"A lot of places were really excited about the possibility of this work and being ahead of the curve -- showing that their company cared about their actors, cared about consent," Ms. Steinrock said in a Zoom interview from her home in Chicago.
Ms. Steinrock -- who has worked on projects including the critically acclaimed Showtime survival drama "Yellowjackets," Netflix's teen dramedy "Never Have I Ever" and the Hulu mini-series "Little Fires Everywhere" -- has been involved in intimacy coordination since its early days. The industry took off thanks in large part to the highly publicized work of the intimacy coordinator Alicia Rodis on the HBO show "The Deuce" in 2018. At that time, Ms. Steinrock, whose background is in improv comedy, was working on a master's degree in theater at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, focused on navigating questions of consent in that space.
"In the improv world, I was picked up a lot or kissed or grabbed, or jokes were made about me that I didn't consent to," she recalled in a TikTok video. "And I was really curious if there were ways to navigate that better."
The issue was particularly thorny in improv, which is grounded in a philosophy of accepting and building on whatever your scene partner gives you.
"You got placed in these uncomfortable or even harmful positions because the whole culture is 'yes, and ... ,"' said Valleri Robinson, the head of the university's theater department, who advised Ms. Steinrock on her master's degree and Ph.D. "It really started to come to the foreground for her that this was a problematic way of creating art."
Ms. Steinrock and Ms. Rodis met through Ms. Steinrock's then-boyfriend, now husband, who is a fight director. Ms. Rodis recognized a kindred spirit, with all the makings of a great intimacy coordinator, in Ms. Steinrock. She mentored Ms. Steinrock on her first gig: a 40-person orgy on the TNT show "Claws." "She was thrown into the lion's den, and she absolutely smashed it," Ms. Rodis recalled.
Ms. Steinrock quickly rose to become a leader in the burgeoning field, and she now dedicates much of her time to educating people about it. In April 2022, she started her TikTok account, which now has more than 700,000 followers. In her videos, she critiques "spicy" scenes on TV shows (her current favorites include "Bridgerton," "Sex Education" and "House of the Dragon"); breaks down how such scenes are filmed; and answers frequently asked questions about her work, such as "What do you do if an actor gets an erection?" or "If two actors are in an offscreen relationship, do they still have to follow the same protocols?" She's not just demystifying her job, but also engaging people in broader conversations about intimacy and consent.
The role of the intimacy coordinator can be a tricky balancing act between choreography and care, and Ms. Steinrock brings an academic grounding in feminist and performance theory to the work, coupled with innate people skills.
"She's very patient," said Karyn Kusama, a director and executive producer on the Showtime drama "Yellowjackets," who worked with Ms. Steinrock on the show's pilot. "She listens. She's looking to the actor to take the lead in terms of ... what will make them feel most cared for."
The pilot of "Yellowjackets" includes several intimate scenes, including one where two high schoolers, played by Sophie Nélisse and Jack Depew, have sex in a car, and another where a housewife, played by Melanie Lynskey, masturbates. Having Ms. Steinrock on set for those scenes was vital, Ms. Kusama said.
As a director, Ms. Kusama said she has always felt a deep empathy with how vulnerable actors are in these scenes and makes a point to check in. But even if she poses a question, it can be hard for an actor who is uncomfortable to respond honestly knowing how much is on the line. An intimacy coordinator, as a neutral party, is more likely to get an honest answer.
"Societally, sex is really hard to talk about," Ms. Steinrock said. Her role is to "create more pathways of communication," she explained, so the actors feel safe discussing any issues, big or small, that may come up.
Having an intimacy coordinator doesn't just create a safer environment, Ms. Kusama said: It also makes for better, sexier art.
"It demands that you take responsibility for your story with the actors, that you actually say, Yeah, we're depicting sex and here's what it needs to mean -- i.e. it needs to mean something," she said. "And conversely, I can say to an intimacy coordinator, 'You know, it feels like I'm watching two people peck each other on the cheek, and there's zero heat here."'
This is where the choreography piece of Ms. Steinrock's job comes in: She can offer ways to use breath or adjust positions to make a scene more evocative.
In just five years, intimacy coordinators have become a vital part of the entertainment industry. HBO has required them on all of their productions since 2019 (Ms. Rodis oversees their program). At this point, Ms. Kusama said, it's hard for her to imagine signing on to a project with intimate scenes without one.
The discipline's explosive growth has meant that coordinators have had to create standards in real time -- like building the tracks of a roller coaster as it shoots into the air. "We have to first define this role and agree on what it is," Ms. Steinrock said. "That's Step 1 of building a new profession. And then we have to define what being qualified for that role looks like."
In 2020, Ms. Steinrock, Ms. Rodis and another intimacy director, Marie Percy, formed Intimacy Directors and Coordinators, with Ms. Steinrock at the helm. She had never been a chief executive before, but she taught herself on the job, quickly growing I.D.C. into the leading training and accreditation organization in the field. Its four-level program includes a mix of virtual and in-person classes. It is the only organization to offer certification for both intimacy coordination and direction, and it also runs workshops for other artistic professionals, such as actors or directors, who want to bring these practices into their work.
"Jessica has created the accountability structures so that we can say: 'This is what our certification means. Here's all the education behind it. Here are the equitable practices we have, and here's the accountability we have to these artists,"' Ms. Rodis said.
Ms. Steinrock sees advocacy for these standards as a key part of I.D.C.'s mission. She was part of a working group organized by the Screen Actors Guild to establish new safety standards for intimacy, which were published in 2020; in 2022, the union launched a registry of vetted intimacy coordinators and announced that it would create a pathway to union membership for these professionals.
"Intimacy coordinators are not a panacea for an industry that has historically abused its actors -- and, frankly, historically abused most of the people in it," Ms. Steinrock said. But integrating them into productions is a clear step that institutions can take, as part of a broader commitment to safety and equity.
For Ms. Steinrock's part, that commitment also includes working to diversify intimacy coordination. While it is a rare female-led discipline in an industry dominated by men, it is still predominantly white and straight -- one of the pitfalls of a young profession that has largely relied on word of mouth to grow.
Ultimately, the hope is that intimacy coordination becomes standard across the entertainment industry, and "that it helps us see each other and the role of sex in our lives differently, as something richer and more filled with possibility," Ms. Kusama said. Ms. Robinson has been excited to see her former student bring these issues out into the open. "She's enhancing our vocabularies and giving us pathways beyond the industry to address these topics that people find so difficult," she said. And while much of that awareness has happened via TikTok, Ms. Robinson also noted that Ms. Steinrock's dissertation had been downloaded more than 700 times -- another sign of just how much interest there is in this area.
Inviting people to re-examine how sex works in the media they consume, Ms. Steinrock said, could improve the way they approach sex in general.
"Media is so many people's first experience with intimacy," she said. "And when we care about how things are made, it starts conversations about how things are operating in other spaces, and I think that can have a huge impact as to what people expect in their day-to-day lives."

Harry and Meghan Are Told to Move Out Of Frogmore Cottage: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Queen Elizabeth II offered Frogmore Cottage to the couple at the time of their wedding, and it was the couple's home base on infrequent visits to Britain.
Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, have been asked to move out of Frogmore Cottage, their five-bedroom Georgian house on the grounds of Windsor Castle, the couple's press secretary said, in a further sign of the bitter rupture between them and the British royal family since they withdrew from royal duties and left Britain.
Queen Elizabeth II offered the house to the couple, known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, at the time of their wedding in 2018. It has served as their home base on infrequent visits to Britain since they relocated to Montecito, Calif.
"We can confirm the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage," said the press secretary, Ashley Hansen, who is head of communications for the couple's foundation, Archewell.
Ms. Hansen did not provide further details about the reasons for or timing of the eviction, which was first reported on Wednesday by The Sun, a British tabloid. The Sun said that King Charles III had made the decision shortly after the publication of Harry's memoir, "Spare," which is replete with scorching accounts of Harry's dysfunctional relationship with Charles, his father; and with his brother, Prince William.
Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on the report, as it did on the claims made in Harry's book. Discussions about the cottage were a "private family matter," according to a person with ties to the palace who was not authorized to speak with the news media and commented on condition of anonymity.
The royal real estate shuffle took on added piquancy with The Sun's report that the king had offered Frogmore Cottage to Prince Andrew, his disgraced younger brother. That would give Andrew a home after he downsizes from his much larger house, Royal Lodge, which is also in a sprawling park near Windsor Castle.
Andrew can no longer afford the upkeep on the residence, The Sun and other newspapers in Britain have reported, after the king planned to cut back his allowance. Prodded by Charles, Queen Elizabeth stripped Andrew of his honorary titles and sent him into a kind of internal exile after he settled a sexual assault lawsuit stemming from his association with the convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.
Losing Frogmore Cottage will be a bitter pill for Harry and Meghan, and it raises doubts that the couple will attend the king's coronation in May. They poured 2.4 million pounds, or about $ 2.9 million, into refurbishments of the charming but ramshackle house, which had been divided into apartments for Windsor Castle employees.
The renovation, which was paid for with taxpayer funds, caused an outcry, and when Harry and Meghan negotiated their withdrawal from royal duties in 2020, they paid back the money. The couple has supported themselves through deals with Netflix, which recently aired a documentary about their split with the royal family, as well as with Penguin Random House, which published Harry's memoir.
In the opaque finances of the royal family, the king does not privately own Frogmore Cottage. It is a part of the Crown Estate, which belongs to the monarch and is run by him. But any rental revenues would flow to the British Treasury.
Charles could face other real estate decisions in the wake of his mother's death last September. Although he works in Buckingham Palace, the king still lives mostly in Clarence House, his nearby London residence, and at Highgrove House, his weekend retreat in Gloucestershire. That leaves the queen's two main residences, Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, largely empty.
Located on the gated grounds of Windsor Castle, Frogmore Cottage offered a refuge and security to Harry and his family, which the couple said have become important issues for them when they visit Britain, as they no longer have state-funded police protection. They pay for private security in the United States.
In the opening of "Spare," Harry recalled a tense meeting with his father and brother in Frogmore Gardens, not far from the cottage, to hash out their differences, hours after the funeral of Prince Philip in April 2021.
"How beautiful it all is, I thought. And also how sad," Harry wrote. "Once upon a time, this was going to be my forever home. Instead it had proved to be just another brief stop."

Full text: Emily Colucci, a freelance art writer, "constantly, mindlessly" browses the online job listings hosted by the nonprofit New York Foundation for the Arts -- and recently she found a doozy.
The ad, seeking a full-time "Executive/Personal Assistant" with "a high level of discretion," had been posted by an anonymous but high-profile "Art World Family." It was that phrase that first caught Colucci's eye: "I thought it might have been a child-care service," she explained. But the ad itself combined a tone so blithe with a detailed list of tasks so unreasonable that Colucci quickly posted it to the blog she co-founded, Filthy Dreams, under the title "I Found It: The Worst Art Job Listing Ever Created."
And what made the blog post immediately catch fire across the internet was that it was only slightly crazier than the sorts of jobs many young people -- the overeducated assistants, the underemployed M.F.A.s, all the well-dressed hordes of the exploited -- already put up with to get a toehold in what looks like the glamour of the art world.
For starters, the lucky candidate would expect to work "in a dynamic, unstructured environment and possess flexibility to change course at a moment's notice."
Among many other domestic chores, the aspiring subordinate would "serve as the central point of communication to household staff (includes chef, nannies, landscapers, dog walkers, housekeeper, contractors, and building managers)," but also be left alone with the couple's 4-year-old. Clothes would need to be picked up from "high end" stores, and one could expect to "coordinate all cleaning, repairs, and guest stays." Do you have a green thumb? You'll need one: The post requires "apartment rooftop garden maintenance."
He or she would make restaurant reservations, R.S.V.P. to events, and "create detailed travel itineraries for family to follow" for domestic or international excursions -- passports to hotels to airport escorts. (Oh, and manage travel bookings for members of the artist's studio, too.)
But the point that really stayed with Colucci was the ad's one-sentence synopsis of the job requirements: "The ideal candidate must be dedicated to a simple goal: make life easier for the couple in every way possible."
"It's just a total lack of self-awareness," she said. "So of course I saw it and I laughed, 'cause it's hilarious."
The listing itself was quickly taken down, but Colucci had uploaded the pdf. As it pinged from one reader to another, people argued about which aspect of the job, which offered to pay " $ 65,000 to $ 95,000," was funniest or most insulting. The most frequently singled out absurdity was the phrase "Manage dog systems," which included "potty breaks, food, day care, dog walkers, vet appts," and helping the studio assistant with in-house cats.
Melanie Martin, director of sales and communications for the N.Y.F.A., said that employees vet listings daily as they are submitted. "We check that job listings adhere to relevant labor laws, including, but not limited to, the inclusion of a salary range," she said, adding that this specific listing was never flagged. The organization did not respond when asked to identify the poster.
"Many people thought it was an art world parody," said Noah Becker, an artist and the publisher of Whitehot Magazine. He said it brought to mind a gory satire of the art world he had seen on Netflix, "a Zoolander version of the art world -- 'Velvet Buzzsaw."'
But if it had been posted "as a goof," said Melissa Stern, an artist and journalist, it was by someone "who knows this world quite intimately."
Emily Mae Smith, a painter who sometimes uses as many as three assistants in her own studio, said she found the ad "completely bonkers."
She was especially struck by the amount of detail. "'We want you to be a personal assistant, we want you to be an executive assistant, but we also want you to do all kinds of liaising with our staff,' which sounds to me like three jobs. Oh, and babysitting?"
But plenty of people found it all too plausible.
Emmy Thelander, an artist and adjunct professor at City University of New York, said it wasn't the job's requirements but their obsessive enumeration that was hardest to swallow. "What's ridiculous," she said, "is that they felt the need to spell out all the belittling things that role implies."
Rebecca Greene, a film producer who once was a personal assistant to a Hollywood A-lister, said, "The tasks aren't that uncommon for what someone of a high-caliber financial situation would want. It's just not typically written out that way, which is sort of intense."
Like many others, Greene also found the salary range low for a job that, by her reckoning, should pay at least $ 150,000 in New York.
Soren Stockman, a poet and performer who works as an executive assistant, found it unlikely that any applicants would collect a full year's salary, anyway. "That's a job where, if you're hired, it's a countdown to being fired," he said. "This person wants to never be affected by anything irritating. There's no way to fill that need for someone."
Colucci said, "It's a microcosm of what goes on in the art world and in a lot of cultural industries. People with a lot of power, and a lot of money, that are basically able to hire a lot of underlings, underpaid, probably young. It's very clear you're going to be abused in this role in some shape or form."
Of course, it's exactly that kind of abuse that leads to successful books and films like "The Nanny Diaries" and "The Devil Wears Prada" -- which may be something that the "Art Family" had in mind when they added that "a nondisclosure agreement must be signed upon hire."

More Big Awards for 'Everything Everywhere': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The film took the top prize, as well as lead actress and two supporting trophies. "Abbott Elementary" and "The White Lotus" were named the top TV shows.
The Screen Actors Guild handed its top award for outstanding cast on Sunday night to "Everything Everywhere All at Once," the hit sci-fi comedy that recently dominated the Directors and Producers Guild Awards and now appears to be a strong best picture front-runner at the Oscars. Three of the four individual acting trophies went to "Everything Everywhere" cast members, too.
But will they also prevail with Oscar?
The safest bet to repeat is "Everything Everywhere" comeback kid Ke Huy Quan, who won the supporting-actor trophy from SAG and has been collecting statuettes in that category all season. During Sunday's show, which aired live on YouTube and will stream exclusively on Netflix next year, the 51-year-old Quan delivered his most touching speech yet.
After rising to fame as a child actor in popular films like "The Goonies" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," Quan found few roles available for Asian actors and moved behind the camera, working in stunt choreography. Still, he paid his SAG dues every year, hoping and biding his time for the resurgence he's finally experiencing.
"To all those at home who are watching, who are struggling and waiting to be seen," Quan said, "please keep on going because the spotlight will one day find you."
In an upset victory, Quan's co-star Jamie Lee Curtis won the supporting-actress statuette over Golden Globe winner Angela Bassett ("Black Panther: Wakanda Forever") and BAFTA winner Kerry Condon ("The Banshees of Inisherin"), suggesting that this may be the season's most fluid acting race.
"I know you look at me and think nepo baby, and I totally get it," said a thrilled Curtis. "But the truth of the matter is I'm 64 years old and this is just amazing!"
Later in the night, "Everything Everywhere" leading lady Michelle Yeoh won a crucial best-actress prize over "Tár" star Cate Blanchett, whom she acknowledged as a titan from the stage.
"Thank you for giving me a seat at the table because so many of us need this," Yeoh told the crowd. "We want to be seen and we want to be heard, and tonight you have shown us that it is possible."
Though the SAGs have honored Asian performers from TV shows, Yeoh was the first Asian woman to win best actress in a movie category, and Quan was the first Asian male actor to win for movies as well.
The only film actor to win who didn't hail from "Everything Everywhere" was Brendan Fraser, who mounted a best-actor comeback with his transformational performance in "The Whale." Though "Elvis" star Austin Butler earned best-actor prizes at BAFTA and the Golden Globes, Fraser wasn't expected to win at the latter show, since he had publicly accused the former Globes head Philip Berk of groping him in 2003 and had said he wouldn't attend the ceremony. (Berk denied the accusation.)
Like many of the night's winners, Fraser spoke about the ups and downs of a Hollywood career: "I've rode that wave lately, and it's been powerful and good," he said, "and I've also had that wave smash me right down to the ocean floor."
SAG's track record with the Oscars is suggestive but spotty. Last year, all four SAG winners triumphed at the Oscars and Jessica Chastain's SAG win for "The Eyes of Tammy Faye" helped her vault to the front of a wide-open best-actress category. But the year before that, only two of the four SAG winners repeated at the Oscars.
But the strongest takeaway from this year's SAG ceremony is that "Everything Everywhere," which cost only $ 14.3 million and took in more than $ 100 million worldwide, is almost certainly headed for a best-picture victory: Of the films that earned top honors at the DGAs, the PGAs and the SAGs -- that is, all three major guilds -- only Ron Howard's "Apollo 13" (1995) failed to go the distance with Oscar.
When the season began, the "Everything Everywhere" directors Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan were surprised that their quirky film was generating awards chatter. But with two weeks left until Hollywood's biggest night, the real surprise would be if anything but "Everything Everywhere" becomes the Oscars' ultimate victor.

Worry Less About Your Wagyu and More About the Person Serving It to You: [Op-Ed]

Author: Tse, Robyn

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I've seen a rise in diners' questions about food -- whether ingredients are local, seasonal, organic, grass-fed, free-range or regeneratively farmed. At a restaurant where I used to work, a guest once asked me how many grams of sugar the cow that became her Wagyu beef dish was fed per day. Diners don't hesitate to ask about the welfare conditions of the pig that became their pork chop.
But what about the welfare of the people sourcing, cooking and serving that pork chop? Guests generally don't ask if the staff members get paid time off, sick leave or pay that's above minimum wage. (Often they get none of the above.) Diners certainly aren't asking about the number of people who cried in the walk-in fridge last week.
Perhaps people are afraid of broaching impolite topics while dining out. Or maybe they just don't know how -- or what -- to ask.
The abuse that runs rampant in high-end professional kitchens was long accepted as the price of excellence. What had been relegated to industry gossip broke through the front pages in 2017, when the #MeToo movement led to sexual harassment and assault allegations and eventual settlements involving influential restaurateurs like Ken Friedman and Mario Batali. Well-known institutions, including Eleven Madison Park and the Willows Inn, were highlighted for being culinarily progressive but culturally regressive. Yet public attention fades quickly -- and with little impetus for sustained change, the industry carries on with its tried and true recipes for success. Several of the implicated chefs, whom I used to look up to as role models, are already involved in new projects.
As part of my indoctrination into this industry, I trained as a young, unpaid intern at Noma, the fine-dining temple in Copenhagen. When I worked there in 2015, I dodged a few comments about my figure and a lecture on how having more women in the kitchen lowered the quality of the food. (A Noma representative said my experience "is not something we recognize, and we are deeply sorry to hear if this has been the experience for any of our team.")
But after hearing worse tales from colleagues at other restaurants -- including one who saw a head chef throw a duck breast at another chef -- I considered myself lucky to have emerged physically unscathed. Until this past fall, Noma continued to employ unpaid interns while charging diners $ 500 per head. After earning the No. 1 spot on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list five times, Noma recently announced that it was closing, amid rising criticism of its labor practices.
In a prior life, I worked for a shiny management consulting firm that announced its ranking on Glassdoor as proudly as some of my other culinary employers have touted their rankings on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list. In one world, I received quarterly performance reviews in the form of thoughtfully written evaluations with tactical feedback. In the other world, my performance was mostly evaluated in the form of verbal abuse. I can confirm that one method is far more effective at inspiring excellence than the other.
Fortunately, the public is beginning to shed its blinders. "Chef's Table," the Netflix show with its stunningly romantic homages to the pursuit of self-actualization through culinary craft, has given way to recent hits like Hulu's "The Bear," which depicts the physically and mentally brutal realities of working in a restaurant, and the horror film "The Menu," which satirizes the elite's fanatical obsession with dishes that have been foraged, surgically tweezered and cooked to precision by miserably abused underlings. Even for those of us who don't treat hunting restaurant reservations as a sport, we must stomach the truth that we are supporting a certain type of work environment every time we decide where to dine.
Restaurant workers deserve a restaurant certification program that evaluates the quality of the workplace as critically as the quality of the ingredients -- a more vigorous version of the restaurant sanitation letter grades established in many states. There should be a symbol for restaurants to display on their windows as proudly as they display their stars and reviews, a symbol that says: We care about our people, too.
A restaurant certification needs to mandate living wages as a bare minimum; the national subminimum hourly wage for tipped workers has been $ 2.13 since 1991. In the age of Covid, sick days should be nonnegotiable. The United States is the only developed country without guaranteed paid parental leave; employers must step in here, too. Since a majority of restaurant workers are women and many are people of color, sexual harassment and racial equity training with zero-tolerance policies are table stakes.
There's also a business case to be made for better culture, of course. Hospitality is facing its most severe staffing crisis ever, worse than many other industries recovering from the pandemic. While some restaurants have turned to pizza-making and salad-tossing robots, the vast majority have been struggling to hire actual humans. A resilient few have adapted, tentatively recognizing that higher wages and more benefits lead to higher retention rates and lower training costs.
Amanda Cohen now offers all employees at Dirt Candy in New York a starting wage of $ 25 per hour, and the Knead Hospitality + Design group, based in Washington, D.C., started testing a four-day workweek model. Starr Restaurants group even began offering signing bonuses to new hires. Audrey, a Nashville restaurant, offers mental health benefits to its employees, and Pujol in Mexico City and Cosme in New York, run by the Casamata group, provide leadership coaching for their general managers.
Such restaurants deserve our enthusiastic support and recognition -- glowing reviews, generous tips, monthly reservations! You can also look for signs that indicate how much a restaurant values its team. Does the menu credit the chefs who developed the dish? Do its social media accounts highlight the individual contributions of team members? If you're about to splurge on a special meal or book a private event, don't hesitate to ask how long the team members have been working there or if they receive health insurance. If you leave a review online or rave to your friends about a meal, don't focus on just the food; also focus on how happy the servers seemed.
For far too long, we have been paying lower menu prices subsidized by labor abuse. Restaurants that instead charge more to reflect the true price of eating out should be embraced. But without a transparent certification program that accounts for compensation, health benefits, turnover rates, rigorous H.R. training and employee surveys, we cannot easily discern which restaurants are putting in the valuable work behind the scenes to build better cultures.
Whether as a diner, an employee or even an investor, we should feel confident when we walk up to a restaurant that high-quality work culture is a key ingredient. I promise the results will be delicious.

The African Soldiers France Tried to Forget: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The success of "Tirailleurs," set in the mire and mayhem of World War I, has helped resurface the often neglected story of colonial soldiers forced to take up somebody else's fight.
With more than one million viewers in its first month in theaters, a movie called "Tirailleurs," or "Riflemen," has touched a nerve in France by bringing attention to a neglected aspect of the nation's history: the decisive role played in two World Wars by African soldiers, many forcibly conscripted in French colonies.
Heated debate and public soul searching has surrounded the movie. Much of the action unfolds during World War I in the cold, muddy trenches of northern and eastern France, a climate and a culture utterly foreign to the disoriented African conscripts who take orders from white officers. (In the United States, the movie's title is "Father and Soldier.")
In scenes of mist, mire and mayhem, countless lives are lost for the gain of a few hundred yards or a single hill. The grotesqueness of the sacrifice seems compounded for the Africans dragooned into fighting somebody else's war. From 1914 to 1918, more than 30,000 of the "tirailleurs," as they were known, were killed.
Released last month, the movie, directed by Mathieu Vadepied, stars Omar Sy, a French actor propelled to international fame through his leading role in "Lupin," a Netflix thriller series.
Sy plays a Senegalese village farmer who enrolls voluntarily in the French forces to watch over a son, played by Alassane Diong, who is snatched from his sunlit rural home by France's colonial army and made to fight in the war.
Rising from French trenches, father and son charge into no-man's lands of shells and bullets -- a form of attritional combat that Europe appeared to have banished before war returned to the continent a century later in the killing fields of eastern Ukraine.
For more than a century, from 1857 to 1960, soldiers from Senegal, as well as from Algeria, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Tunisia and elsewhere in Africa, fought for France in colonial wars in Africa, in the trenches of World War I, in the World War II campaign to defeat the Nazis and in wars in Indochina and Algeria.
That history was long repressed. Official disinterest, obfuscation, dismissiveness and stereotyping, tinged with apparent racism, accompanied the story of France's Black soldiers to the point that it was only on the day of the release of the movie that the French authorities acted to remove a last small humiliation inflicted on the tirailleurs.
The government announced that 37 survivors, men mostly in their 90s who had fought in French wars in Indochina and Algeria, would no longer be obliged to spend six months a year in France -- usually in rudimentary hostels -- to receive their pensions. They could be with their families in Africa as much as they wished.
Asked on French TV about the timing of this concession, Sy, who is of Senegalese-Mauritanian origin and grew up in France, deadpanned: "You know, coincidences do exist."
As a Black man now living in the United States, Sy is a natural target for the extreme nationalist right in France. Last month, as the movie was released, he was widely vilified for having the temerity to suggest that Europeans were more sensitive to wars in Europe than in Africa.
"The showbiz starlet Omar Sy tries to lecture us when he has never been interested in the wars in Africa," Julien Odoul, a lawmaker from Marine Le Pen's National Rally party, said. "We wish he would either be a little more coherent or just simply shut up."
The movie, as Sy made clear at the Cannes Film Festival last year, is one of particular importance to him. "We don't have the same memory, but we share the same history," he said.
By telling the story through a fictionalized filial relationship, and locating the initial part of the movie in Senegal, Vadepied, the director, contrives to personalize the war's horror for the African conscripts. Their flailing attempts to adjust to the unimaginable are palpable and poignant.
"The film is very important because it has already contributed enormously to awareness of this history," said Julien Fargettas, a French Army veteran and historian.
"Consciously or unconsciously, we repressed this colonial past," he added. "But the fact is, if these African riflemen had not been there in World War II, France would not have been liberated. That cannot be denied."
Soon after the liberation of France began in June 1944 with the Normandy landings, another landing took place in the south of the country that has earned little of the renown or recognition accorded the heroes of D-Day, even though it would prove critical to the Allied victory.
On Aug. 15, 1944, and in the following days, some 370,000 Allied troops stormed ashore in Provence, near the town of Saint-Raphaël, many of them Africans, most of them conscripted in French colonies -- as had happened during World War I.
These were the troops who, alongside American, British and Canadian forces, as well as French fighters from the Resistance, liberated southern cities such as Marseille and Toulon before moving northward. Yet their contribution has scarcely been celebrated.
One of the leading campaigners to align history, which is based on facts, and memory, which is selective, has been Aïssata Seck, 39, granddaughter of one of the tirailleurs. An elected official in the hardscrabble Seine-Saint-Denis area north of Paris, she said that she had been moved by encounters with the neglected veterans, often living in appalling conditions, to embark on a decade-long campaign to restore their dignity.
"There has been a form of racism and denial and ignorance that I could not accept," she said in an interview. "The movie constitutes a decisive step in spreading awareness because more than a million people have already seen it. Teachers will be able to use it."
Seck prodded François Hollande, then the president, to naturalize 28 of the African riflemen in 2017. A presidential statement at the time said that it was time for "recognition of the courage" of the tirailleurs who had fought for France.
But recognition hardly flowed. It was Seck again in 2019, on the 75th anniversary of the Normandy landings, who pushed for some equivalent recognition of the Provence landing.
"I called the Élysée several times," she said, referring to the official residence of the French president. "I discovered that nothing was planned. Nothing." She added that she had been forced to "publicly exhort" President Emmanuel Macron to hold a commemoration.
Seck was behind a collective letter from historians, journalists and others that was published in the newspaper Le Monde on July 5, 2019, saying that the Provence landing had long been "whitened."
It was time, the letter's authors wrote, to face history and overcome forgetfulness. As the letter noted, of the 235,000 members of the French Army who participated in the Provence landing, some 90 percent were "colonial troops."
Mr. Macron duly made a major speech at Saint-Raphaël on Aug. 15, 2019, noting that the landing on that date 75 years earlier had been "the second act of our liberation" and that "the very great majority" of the army that liberated France "came from Africa."
He asked: "Who among you remembers their names or their faces?"
A presidential initiative to name or rename French streets and squares after some of the African fighters has made only faltering progress.
Those men were long nameless. Gaspard Mbaye, a Senegalese immigrant who arrived in France in 1988 and 20 years later founded an association dedicated to the memory of the tirailleurs, said that he had been appalled to discover that in the Trabuquet Cemetery in Menton, southern France, about half of the more than 1,100 graves of Africans killed in World War I bore no name. He has worked to rectify that.
"The movie has had some effect, which is good, but we are still far from full recognition of these men," Mr. Mbaye said in an interview. "These men have children and grandchildren who should be able to move freely between their countries and France."
Mr. Fargettas, the historian, said that among the worst forms of mistreatment of African soldiers came in 1944 in what he called "the whitening" of the army as it moved north from the Provence landing.
"The tirailleurs were forced to give their uniform to young resistance fighters," he said. "Some were even obliged to wear German uniforms." So was the myth consolidated that France's army of liberation was all white.
In Dakar, the capital of Senegal, a massacre followed on Dec. 1, 1944, as Senegalese troops demanded of the French colonial authorities that they be paid in full, including a demobilization bonus.
Alleging a "mutiny," French forces opened fire at Thiaroye, a town in the suburbs of Dakar. "There may well have been 300 dead, but France only officially acknowledges about 35," Mr. Fargettas said.
"Tirailleurs" may never achieve full redress for the lack of acknowledgment of the crucial African contribution to France's wars in Europe, but it has already made a significant difference.
"After this battle, you will no longer be Indigenous, you will be French!" one officer promises his African riflemen in the movie as they prepare to rise out of the trenches. "Indigenous forces" was a term used by the French Army for its African conscripts. But that pledge, like so many made to the Black men who fought for France, proved empty.
For Sy, as he wrote in The New York Times last year, stories in movies can create "a collective movement that can shift lines."
The hard lines of French history may be shifting. De Gaulle liberated France. So did the African dead in Menton and Thiaroye. The French Army was not white. It was whitened.

Vice's C.E.O. To Leave Job After 5 Years: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Nancy Dubuc is leaving the media company, which is exploring a sale of some or all of the business, after nearly five years there.
When Vice Media named Nancy Dubuc as its new chief executive in 2018, her contract hinted at one of her missions. Sell the company -- at the time a darling of the media industry -- and she could cash in on a big stock grant, according to a copy of the contract obtained by The New York Times.
So far, that hasn't come to pass. On Friday, Ms. Dubuc said she was leaving Vice, which investors expect is worth far less than before she took over.
Just a month ago, Ms. Dubuc announced publicly that the company was for sale. No deal has materialized yet.
Her unexpected departure -- her last day is Friday -- and Vice's struggles in recent years, highlight the fallen fortunes of a group of digital media companies that not long ago was talked about as the future of the industry.
Vice, which was hailed as a new-media colossus at the height of its eye-popping valuation of $ 5.7 billion, has been written down by some of its initial backers, including Disney. The company has debts piling up, and it is now expected to sell for far less than that sky-high valuation.
A person with knowledge of the sales process said that bids to acquire Vice were due soon, and that the company would likely sell within the next 60 days.
Other top digital media companies, such as BuzzFeed and Vox Media, have had similar setbacks. Investor enthusiasm has waned as those companies have struggled to live up to some of their lofty ambitions, digital advertising shifted increasingly to tech giants like Alphabet and Meta, and legacy media companies began focusing on catching up to streaming giants like Netflix.
"The market has corrected back to the basics," said Keith Hernandez, a former BuzzFeed executive who is a co-founder of the digital consultancy Launch Angle. "Potential and promise have gave way to profit margin and efficiency. Sexy just doesn't sell."
In a note to the staff on Friday, Ms. Dubuc said that although Vice faced business headwinds, the company had become less reliant on advertising during her tenure and had made strides to become more financially independent.
She also nodded to other improvements under her leadership, including creating a more inclusive workplace environment. Ms. Dubuc joined Vice shortly after investigations into the company's culture, including by The Times, revealed incidents of sexual harassment against women who worked for the company.
"I know you are among the most resilient, creative and determined talent in the business, and your futures are bright and hopeful," Ms. Dubuc wrote in her email. "Remember what I try to remind you, and that is to appreciate how far you've come."
Reached by phone on Friday, she declined to comment further.
In a statement, Vice's board said Ms. Dubuc had joined the company during a critical period and "positioned the company for long-term success," adding that Vice would soon announce new leadership for the company.
Vice declined to comment on its boardroom deliberations.
Ms. Dubuc replaced Shane Smith, a founder of Vice, who had struck a series of deals that drove the company's valuation ever higher but left it with onerous financial obligations to its increasingly anxious investors, who were antsy for an exit.
There was a major point of tension at the beginning of Ms. Dubuc's appointment.
In March 2018, Vice's board of directors gathered over teleconference in a special session to select its new chief executive, according to a copy of the minutes of the meeting obtained by The Times and two people with knowledge of the board's deliberations. Mr. Smith, a board member, told other directors that leaks to the press were forcing the company to speed up some of its decision-making.
In addition, Kevin Mayer, a board member who was then a high-ranking executive at Disney, expressed frustration that he did not know about Ms. Dubuc's potential hiring until it had reached the final stages. Disney had an ownership stake in Vice and A&E Networks, where Ms. Dubuc was chief executive.
Still, the board approved Ms. Dubuc's hire, expressing optimism that an experienced executive with her track record could address the cultural issues at Vice and improve its financial performance ahead of a potential sale. Mr. Mayer, who was irate, abstained from the vote.
As part of her contract, Ms. Dubuc was granted tens of thousands of shares in Vice, according to the copy of her contract. Because the company is private, selling shares can be a cumbersome process. The shares would be easier to cash in if the company sold or went public. Stock grants are a common incentive offered to employees at start-ups. Ms. Dubuc was also given an annual salary of more than $ 1.5 million and a hefty sign-on bonus, according to the copy of her contract.
In the years since Ms. Dubuc joined the company, it has struggled to reach sustained profitability. Last year, the company missed its revenue target of roughly $ 700 million by about $ 100 million. Many of Vice's biggest backers, which included Disney and A&E Networks, are no longer expecting to turn a profit on the investments they made in the company.
In an interview last month about plans to sell some or all of the company, Ms. Dubuc said Vice would break even in 2023.
At the time, she said the company had been facing serious problems when she arrived, noting that it was "unclear whether the company could survive."

Insular Poland Opens to Wave Of Newcomers: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The country, once one of the world's most ethnically and culturally homogeneous, has accommodated far more refugees from neighboring Ukraine than any other nation.
A year ago, Russia's military onslaught on Ukraine sent millions of refugees fleeing west, often to countries wary of taking in foreigners, raising fears of a repeat of the political convulsions set off by a migration crisis in 2015 that involved far fewer people.
But the paradox of foreigner-leery governments taking in huge numbers of Ukrainians has been especially stark in Poland, long one of the world's most ethnically homogeneous countries with a deep-seated mistrust of outsiders and a tangled, often painful history with Ukraine.
Since Feb. 24 last year, when Russia invaded Ukraine, Poland has recorded nearly 10 million crossings across its frontier with Ukraine into Polish territory. President Biden, on a visit to Poland on Tuesday, paid tribute to its open-armed response in a speech in Warsaw. "God bless you," he said.
To understand this approach in a country that just before the war started was beating back asylum seekers trying to sneak in from neighboring Belarus, consider the change of heart Ryszard Marcinkowski, 74, a retired Polish railway worker, experienced.
He grew up with horror stories about the brutality of Ukrainian nationalists told by his parents and aunt, all refugees from formerly Polish lands in what, since World War II, has been western Ukraine.
Yet when millions of Ukrainians started arriving in Poland last February, Mr. Marcinkowski drove to the border to deliver food and other supplies.
"I had a very bad image of Ukrainians from my family but realized that I had to help them," Mr. Marcinkowski said. "For Poland," he added, "Russia has always been the bigger evil."
Since the war began, the Polish authorities have recorded 9.8 million crossings into Poland from Ukraine. That includes multiple crossings back and forth by some people and others who left quickly for other countries. But Poland, according to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, is now sheltering around two million Ukrainians, down from more than five million last year but still more than the population of Warsaw, the Polish capital.
Some far-right politicians, Mr. Morawiecki said in an interview on Tuesday, "are trying to create noise and animosity between Poles and Ukrainians" but "they failed." Instead of being a burden or a threat, he said, the influx "will strengthen Poland demographically" and "enrich our culture."
"I wish Ukraine well, but if people who came here would like to stay, they will after some time have permanent documents and will be able to stay and will make us stronger from many different angles," the prime minister said.
Rebuilt from ruins after 1945 amid seething hostility to Germans, Russians and Ukrainians, Poland has accommodated far more refugees from neighboring Ukraine than any other country. Germany is next with about a million.
Poland's response to the refugee situation in Ukraine has won plaudits from the European Union and has given its right-wing government more clout, offsetting its previous reputation as a troublemaker because of what the bloc's executive arm in Brussels views as moves to undermine the independence of the Polish judiciary and discriminate against L.G.B.T. people. But long-running disputes with Brussels still rumble on.
In the early days of the war, those fleeing the war in Ukraine, mostly women and children, surged into eastern Polish towns across the border. But as hopes of a swift end to the fighting faded, nearly all moved farther west, eager to find a place to live and work.
Refugees, largely dependent on the charity of strangers for food and shelter, are now often residents fending for themselves. Few have permanent residency status but many have jobs with Polish companies and children in Polish schools. All have access to Polish health care and other services.
The scale of change in Poland is particularly evident in the western city of Wroclaw (pronounced VROTZ-waf), the formerly German city of Breslau. Ethnically cleansed of Germans after 1945 and repopulated with ethnic Poles, many of them refugees from lost territory in Ukraine, the city long boasted that "every stone in Wroclaw speaks Polish."
Now, local officials say, more than a quarter of Wroclaw's population speaks Ukrainian and or Russian, and around 20 percent of school students are from Ukraine. It has more than a half-dozen grocery stores and two supermarkets run by Ukrainians that sell mostly Ukrainian food, like Kyiv cake and patriotic boxes of candy called "Everything Will be Ukraine."
The presence of what officials put at around 250,000 Ukrainians in a city that before the war had a population of 640,000 has not gone down well with everyone.
At a soccer game in the Wroclaw stadium in October, a group of fans hoisted a big banner reading: "Stop the Ukrainization of Poland."
But this, said Radoslaw Michalski, the official coordinating Wroclaw's refugee response, reflected only a "marginal fringe." He said the public had mainly rallied to support Ukrainians, an outpouring of generosity he compared to the grass-roots mobilization during catastrophic floods that engulfed the city in 1997, a calamity featured in the Netflix series "High Water."
"As happened during the flood, people mobilized spontaneously not to fight someone but to help their city," he said. In the early days of the war, more than 4,000 Wroclaw residents volunteered to help Ukrainians arriving by rail.
"Nobody coordinated things in the beginning," Mr. Michalski said. "It was spontaneous."
New arrivals by train in Wroclaw from Ukraine, which peaked at 12,000 on a single day last March, have slowed to a trickle of around 20 people a day, said Yurii Matnenko, who oversees a reception center at a station run by Fundacja Ukraina, a charity that has shifted from focusing on finding Ukrainians shelter to helping them find work and navigate Polish bureaucracy.
"Everyone thought the war would end in a month or two but now sees this did not happen, so they need to get jobs," he said.
Most Ukrainians say they eventually want to go home, a desire encouraged by the government in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, which offers online learning for refugee children so they can keep up with the Ukrainian curriculum.
Veronika Goncharuk, who arrived in Wroclaw in April from Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine with her husband and three children, is keeping her options open, enrolling her two sons and her daughter in a Polish state school and also in online Ukrainian classes.
But she said it probably made more sense "for the sake of my children" to settle in Poland because "with a neighbor like Russia, Ukraine will never be at peace." Her husband has found a job as an electrician.
For the moment, the family lives for free in a single room at a former college dormitory.
The children have learned Polish, though Anastasia, 10, lamented that her only friend at school was a fellow Ukrainian girl, Katya, who got sick recently and left her friendless in class. Polish classmates, she said, do not pick on her for being Ukrainian but "leave me sitting alone. I really miss Katya."
Igor Czerwinski, a Polish language teacher at a Wroclaw school that has taken in 150 Ukrainian students in addition to 250 Polish pupils, said he had heard grumbling from fellow staff members about the strain brought on by the influx of foreigners.
An ethnic Pole born in Kazakhstan, he speaks Russian as well as Polish, attends an Orthodox church in Wroclaw filled with Ukrainian worshipers and celebrates the "positive energy" brought to the city by so many refugees hungry to succeed. Ukrainians, he said, are among his best students.
As the war grinds on, Ukrainians in Wroclaw are no longer fleeing for their lives but, often helped by Polish-speaking compatriots who emigrated before the war, trying to settle down. At the city's civil affairs office last week, two Ukrainians from Odesa got married in a ceremony presided over by a Polish clerk assisted by a Ukrainian translator. Both the bride and the groom found work at a battery factory and, according to the bride, Elena Poperechna, "have decided we want to live in Poland."
Grzegorz Hryciuk, a history professor at the University of Wroclaw, said the influx of Ukrainians mirrored the arrival in Wroclaw more than eight decades ago of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Poles from lost Polish territories in western Ukraine, formerly eastern Poland.
Many of these Polish refugees, he said, harbored a deep hatred of Ukrainians, whom they blamed for massacres before and during the war, as well as hope of returning swiftly to their former homes in and around formerly Polish cities like Lviv. Slowly though, "they adjusted to reality," the professor said, and made new lives in exile.
That pattern is now starting to repeat, only with ethnic Ukrainians instead of ethnic Poles, raising questions about whether and how long cities like Wroclaw and the Polish state can handle a drastic demographic and ethnic shift. Poland, which has long resisted taking in people from the Middle East and Africa, has mostly welcomed Ukrainians, who, said Professor Hryciuk, benefit from the fact that "in their appearance and customs they are not that different from Poles. They are not an other."
There is still some concern that the influx could create an opening for extremist nationalist groups to the right of Poland's governing Law and Justice party, itself a deeply conservative political force that campaigned in the past on promises to keep out foreigners.
But Przemyslaw Witkowski, an expert on far-right extremism from Wroclaw who teaches at Collegium Civitas, a private university in Warsaw, said Poland's extreme nationalist fringe was currently split over the war and refugees from Ukraine.
Ultrareligious groups like one called Confederation, he said, look to Russia as a bulwark against secular Western values and denounce the "Ukrainization" of Poland, while groups with neo-Nazi, pagan leanings support Ukrainians "because they are white, they are Slavs and they are against Russia."
Neither, he added, has gained much traction with the general public, in part because "it is hard to create serious tension when people have jobs." The unemployment rate in Wroclaw is under 2 percent.
Lukasz Kaminski, the director of the National Ossolinski Institute, an institution promoting Polish culture that moved from Lviv to Wroclaw in 1945, said the nationalist ideal of an entirely Polish Poland was now finished.
"Everything has changed because of the war," he said, describing the influx of Ukrainians as a return to Wroclaw's roots in the Middle Ages as a "mixed land" of Germans, Poles, Jews and other ethnic groups. "Single nation Poland was always artificial -- against our history and against our past experience," he said.

Ultrareligious groups like one called Confederation, he said, look to Russia as a bulwark against secular Western values and denounce the “Ukrainization” of Poland, while groups with neo-Nazi, pagan leanings support Ukrainians “because they are white, they are Slavs and they are against Russia.”
Neither, he added, has gained much traction with the general public, in part because “it is hard to create serious tension when people have jobs.” The unemployment rate in Wroclaw is under 2%.
Lukasz Kaminski, the director of the National Ossolinski Institute, an institution promoting Polish culture that moved from Lviv to Wroclaw in 1945, said the nationalist ideal of an entirely Polish Poland was now finished.
“Everything has changed because of the war,” he said, describing the influx of Ukrainians as a return to Wroclaw’s roots in the Middle Ages as a “mixed land” of Germans, Poles, Jews and other ethnic groups. “Single-nation Poland was always artificial — against our history and against our past experience,” he said.

'All Quiet on the Western Front' Wins Big at the BAFTAs: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The German-language antiwar movie won best film, best director and five other awards at Britain's equivalent of the Academy Awards.
In a shock to this year's awards season, "All Quiet on the Western Front," a German-language movie set in the trenches of World War I, was the big winner at the EE British Academy Film and Television Arts Awards in London on Sunday night.
The Netflix movie was named best picture at the awards, commonly known as the BAFTAs. The antiwar film beat four higher-profile titles, including "Everything Everywhere All at Once," the sci-fi adventure starring Michelle Yeoh, and "The Banshees of Inisherin," Martin McDonagh's dark comedy about the ending of a friendship on a small island.
"All Quiet" also beat Baz Luhrmann's "Elvis" biopic and "Tár," Todd Field's drama about a conductor accused of sexual harassment.
Based on Erich Maria Remarque's 1929 novel of the same title, "All Quiet on the Western Front" won six other awards, including best director for Edward Berger, best adapted screenplay and best film not in the English language.
During the ceremony, Berger seemed overcome by the wins. While accepting the award for best adapted screenplay, he mentioned the movie's antiwar message and Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
"There are no heroes in any war," he said.
"All Quiet" was expected to do well at the awards, Britain's equivalent of the Oscars. When the BAFTA nominations were announced last month, it secured 14 nods and tied with Ang Lee's 2000 action film "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" for the highest number of nominations for a movie not in the English language.
British critics raved about the movie upon its release. Danny Leigh wrote in The Financial Times that Berger "expertly handled" the challenge facing any antiwar film: how to stop war from looking glamorous. "Here, dawn quagmires lit by dots of orange flame and troops mad-eyed with animal fear register both as fine cinema and potent fury," Leigh said.
Peter Bradshaw said in The Guardian that "All Quiet" was "a powerful, eloquent, conscientiously impassioned film."
American critics were less effusive. Ben Kenigsberg, writing in The New York Times, said the film "aims to pummel you with ceaseless brutality."
The BAFTAs have long been seen as a bellwether for the Oscars, scheduled for March 12, because of an overlap between their voting bodies. "All Quiet" is nominated for nine categories at those awards, including for best film.
Steven Spielberg's award favorite "The Fabelmans" wasn't nominated for best movie or best director at the BAFTAs; it received one nomination, for best original screenplay.
Before "All Quiet" swept the main prizes, this year's BAFTAs, held at the Royal Festival Hall in London, had a variety of winners, with the major acting awards shared by three films.
Cate Blanchett won best actress for playing a conductor in crisis in "Tár." She beat nominees that included Viola Davis for her performance in "The Woman King," Danielle Deadwyler for her role as Emmett Till's mother in "Till," and Yeoh for "Everything Everywhere All at Once."
Accepting the prize, a tearful Blanchett thanked her fellow nominees for "breaking the myth that women's experience is monolithic."
Austin Butler won the best actor award for his title role in "Elvis." Butler last month took the same prize at the Golden Globes and was nominated for best actor at the Oscars.
"The Banshees of Inisherin," one of this award season's most highly touted movies, did not leave the BAFTAs empty-handed, taking four awards, including best original screenplay, best supporting actor for Barry Keoghan and best supporting actress for Kerry Condon.
The ceremony, hosted by Richard E. Grant, was short on drama, though Carey Mulligan, nominated for "She Said," was accidentally announced as the best supporting actress instead of Condon.
The incident occurred when Troy Kotsur, the deaf star of "CODA," was announcing the category's winner with an interpreter. The mistake was edited out of the show's television broadcast in Britain.

Books by Dahl Are Rewritten, Spurring Outcry: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New editions of the best-selling author's children's classics, including "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," have been altered to eliminate words deemed inappropriate. A backlash ensued.
LONDON -- New editions of the works of Roald Dahl -- the best-selling British novelist whose children's classics include "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," "Matilda" and "James and the Giant Peach" -- have been rewritten in an effort to make them less offensive and more inclusive, according to a representative from the author's estate.
The changes have prompted widespread criticism from prominent literary figures and others, including Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of Britain. The books' publisher, Puffin Books, and the author's estate did not immediately respond to questions about the nature of the changes. However, The Telegraph, a British newspaper, earlier reported that hundreds of words, including descriptions of characters' appearances, races and genders, had been changed or removed in at least 10 of the author's 19 children's books.
Dahl died in 1990. A review of the author's works began in 2020, before Netflix acquired the Roald Dahl Story Company, which manages the author's copyrights and trademarks, Rick Behari, a company spokesman, said in a statement on Monday.
"When publishing new print runs of books written years ago, it's not unusual to review the language used alongside updating other details including a book's cover and page layout," Mr. Behari said, adding that the efforts were led together with Puffin. "Our guiding principle throughout has been to maintain the story lines, characters, and the irreverence and sharp-edged spirit of the original text."
Changes reported by The Telegraph include characters who are no longer described as "fat" and references to "mothers" and "fathers" that have been updated to "parents" or "family."
Mr. Behari said that the estate had partnered with Inclusive Minds, an organization that champions diversity and accessibility in children's literature. In a statement on Monday, the group declined to discuss the Dahl project specifically. While noting that it did not "write, edit or rewrite texts," the group said that it had helped "provide valuable input when it comes to reviewing language that can be damaging and perpetuate harmful stereotypes."
Dahl, who was overtly anti-Semitic, was no stranger to criticism, as his works were called antisocial, brutish and anti-feminist. But they remain widely read and are regularly reimagined for the silver screen. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" has twice been turned into films, in 1971 and 2005, and another adaptation, starring Timothée Chalamet, is set to be released this year.
Criticism of the changes was swift.
"There are millions, probably, of his books in secondhand editions in school libraries and classrooms," Philip Pullman, author of the "His Dark Materials" trilogy, told the BBC on Monday. "What are you going to do about them? All those words are still there. You going to round up all the books and cross them out with a big black pen?"
A spokesman for Mr. Sunak, referencing a work by Dahl, told the BBC, "When it comes to our rich and varied literary heritage, the prime minister agrees with the BFG that we shouldn't gobblefunk around with words."
And Salman Rushdie, the prizewinning author of "Midnight's Children" and "The Satanic Verses," called the changes "absurd censorship."
Suzanne Nossel, chief executive of Pen America, an organization that supports freedom of expression, said on Twitter that the organization was "alarmed" by the changes and that selective editing could "represent a dangerous new weapon."
"Those who might cheer specific edits to Dahl's work should consider how the power to rewrite books might be used in the hands of those who do not share their values and sensibilities," she said.
Matthew Dennison, who wrote a biography of Dahl, said by email on Monday that the author was known to have fractious relationships with his editors and disliked anyone tampering with his work.
Dahl often focused on individual words or particular expressions when editing, Mr. Dennison said, and "continued to use elements of the interwar slang of his childhood, and aspects of his vocabulary up to his death."
Dahl always resisted unnecessary sanitizing, Mr. Dennison said, noting that the author would recognize that alterations to his novels, brought on by the political climate, reflected adult sensibilities rather than children's misgivings.
"I never get any protests from children," Mr. Dahl once said. "All you get are giggles of mirth and squirms of delight. I know what children like."

Psychedelics Show Promise, With Caveats: [Science Desk]

Full text: While drugs like ketamine and psilocybin are largely considered safe, here's what to know about who should be cautious.
When Dr. Charles Nemeroff first met his patient, the 32-year-old woman had already been to see several psychiatrists. Initially, the woman, whose identity has been concealed to protect her privacy, had experienced paranoid and racing thoughts, insisting there were listening devices in her phone and that people were watching her; she even sold her home in an attempt to get away from them. After being given antipsychotic drugs, her mania and psychosis abated, but they were replaced by debilitating depression.
"By the time she came to me, she said, 'I have no feelings whatsoever. I have no mood variation. I am completely empty,"' said Dr. Nemeroff, who is chair of the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School.
While the woman had been treated for mild depression for over 10 years, she'd previously maintained a rich social life and fulfilling career. This -- the psychosis followed by the deep depression -- was something completely different. And it was triggered by her use of psychedelics.
Eight months earlier, the woman had tried hallucinogenic mushrooms for the first time with friends and had such a great time that she took them again the next day. The second time, though, something went terribly wrong.
"She had a full blown psychotic episode for the first time in her life," said Dr. Nemeroff, who published the woman's story as a case report in The American Journal of Psychiatry in December. Her friends, who took the same drugs she did both days, had no lasting ill effects.
Psychedelics have surged in popularity in recent years: 1.4 million Americans tried hallucinogens for the first time in 2020, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This enthusiasm is partly attributed to clinical trials showing that the drugs, most notably psilocybin and ketamine, hold real promise in treating some mental health disorders, particularly depression.
There has also been a shift in how the drugs are presented in popular culture and the media, like in Michael Pollan's best-selling book and Netflix series, "How to Change Your Mind." Two states, Oregon and Colorado, have now legalized psilocybin for therapeutic use, and more are expected to follow suit.
As these drugs gain mainstream acceptance, more and more people will likely consider taking them, both therapeutically and recreationally. Experts who study these substances strongly urge that people only use them in supervised therapeutic settings, such as in a clinical trial or at an established ketamine clinic, partly because of safety concerns and partly because they are illegal outside of these confines. Realistically, though, many people will use them elsewhere.
Psychedelics have an extremely low chance of lethal overdose and there is little likelihood of addiction. As a result, they have been classified by experts as some of the least harmful recreational drugs. But that doesn't mean they are entirely without risk. Because of this, psilocybin trials and ketamine clinics have strict exclusion criteria to try to protect people who have physical or psychological vulnerabilities.
If you're considering using these drugs, here's what to know about when they could potentially be dangerous.
Serious psychiatric disorders
When it comes to significant side effects, experts' primary worry about ketamine, psilocybin and other hallucinogens, like LSD or ayahuasca, is that they can trigger a psychotic or manic episode. Because these drugs (with the exception of ketamine) are not approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, the safety data on them is scarce. Instead, most of the basis for this concern stems from anecdotal evidence.
What little data does exist suggests that the chances of psychosis developing in the general population is low. One survey of over 1,000 self-reporting recreational psychedelic users did not find a link between drug use and schizophrenia-like symptoms. Another study similarly showed no connection between past psychedelic use and current psychosis or other psychiatric disorders.
However, experts say the risk of psychedelics triggering a psychotic or manic episode is likely elevated for people who have a personal or family history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Consequently, people with these histories are excluded from psilocybin clinical trials and treatment at ketamine clinics.
"I had many patients that would give me the story that they were more or less fine, they took LSD, and they've had schizophrenia since," said Dr. Bryan Roth, a pharmacology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "My guess is they had some underlying predisposition to schizophrenia and it sort of tipped them over the edge."
Dr. Nemeroff agreed: "I think the issue with these very powerful medications is that there are probably people who are genetically vulnerable to a major psychiatric illness, but they haven't reached the threshold yet. And then what these medications might do is unleash it."
Backing up these concerns, one of the few studies looking at psychedelic use in people with bipolar disorder found that one-third reported that their symptoms worsened after taking psilocybin recreationally, and 3 percent had to seek emergency medical care.
As a result, Dr. Roth said, "Anybody with a serious psychiatric disorder -- like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder -- should not take psychedelics."
Cardiovascular concerns
Psychedelics' emerging legal status also means there is very little research about their physical safety. Experts do know that psilocybin and ketamine raise blood pressure and heart rate, so out of an abundance of caution, people with heart conditions, such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, heart disease and arrhythmias, are advised not to take them.
During carefully monitored clinical trials, where dosage is supervised and patients are screened, the drugs "appear to be safe from a cardiac standpoint," said Dr. Jeremy Ruskin, a professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital who specializes in cardiology. Whether they are as safe for people who are at high risk in uncontrolled settings is unknown.
One reason that psychedelics appear to be safer than many other drugs is because the majority of users take them infrequently, meaning there's little concern that potential damage could accumulate over time. However, experts say there is a second, hypothetical cardiovascular risk if the drugs are taken every day or every week.
Most hallucinogens are thought to produce their psychedelic effects by activating a specific serotonin receptor called 5-HT2A (except ketamine, which primarily works via the glutamate system). The drugs also act on a sibling serotonin receptor, 5-HT2B, which has been linked to valvular heart disease. Research has shown that medications that activate this receptor -- which include some used to treat Parkinson's disease and migraines, as well as the infamous diet drug fen-phen -- cause valvular damage in roughly 25 percent of people who take them. Two small studies of frequent, heavy users of MDMA (another psychedelic-related drug that activates 5-HT2B) showed the same signs of heart disease.
Dr. Roth said that the risk of developing valvular problems from doing psychedelics a few times "is almost probably zero." But he is worried about people who microdose -- taking tiny amounts of the drugs -- several times a week.
Other safety concerns
There are a few other notable risks pertaining to medications or medical history that potential users of psychedelics should be aware of.
First, the drugs substantially alter brain activity, so it's possible they could trigger a seizure in someone with epilepsy.
In addition, Dr. Celia Morgan, a professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Exeter in England, said that people who've had a traumatic brain injury should consult with their doctor before using ketamine, because the drug can increase intracranial pressure.
"If you've got anything in your brain that's raising the pressure, then you raise the pressure further, you could end up with a horrible hemorrhage," she explained.
In terms of medication interactions, people on antidepressant drugs that affect serotonin levels should be careful about taking psilocybin because too much of the neurochemical can cause a potentially fatal reaction known as serotonin syndrome. Dr. Roth said the risk is greatest for people taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (M.A.O.I.s); it's less clear for the more commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (S.S.R.I.s, like Prozac). Just in case, psilocybin clinical trials typically require participants to go off their antidepressants first.
For ketamine, the biggest risk is taking it while you're also on drugs that depress the central nervous system, like opiates, muscle relaxants or benzodiazepines, because those medications could enhance or prolong ketamine's sedative effect.
Finally, although the general risk for dependence on psychedelics is extremely low, for ketamine it is not nonexistent. Dr. Morgan said that using the drug multiple times a week and wanting more after it wears off would be red flags for addiction.
"I think it's got enormous value," she said. "But we're going to miss that if we're not mindful of the risks."

A Freshman Guard at Stanford Is on a Mission for India: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ryan Agarwal, a Cardinal shooting guard who was born in Texas, is hoping to increase Indian representation in the N.C.A.A. and beyond.
STANFORD, Calif. -- The arena in Frisco, Texas, is only a 30-minute drive from Ryan Agarwal's hometown near Dallas. But for a middle-school-age Agarwal, stepping inside was like entering another world.
In 2015, Agarwal was a sixth grader obsessed with basketball. So that year, when the Dallas Mavericks made the 7-foot-2 Satnam Singh the first Indian-born player selected in an N.B.A. draft, Agarwal knew he had to go see him compete. On a trip two years later with his cousin and father to watch Singh in an N.B.A. G League game, Ryan Agarwal realized he wanted to play like Singh himself.
Agarwal's parents had emigrated from India, and he was born in a Dallas suburb. He said he had never seen someone who looked like him playing basketball and had therefore never considered taking the game seriously. It was watching Singh, he said, that made him believe he could play at a high level.
"It was just excitement for him to connect with someone he can see is like himself," Ashok Agarwal, Ryan's father, said.
Six years later, Ryan Agarwal is much farther from home -- 1,700 miles away at Stanford University, where he is a freshman shooting guard trying to bolster the Cardinal's faltering offense. He's still chasing Singh, hoping to pick up where Singh left off in representing India in the American basketball landscape while playing the sport in college.
"I just have to keep in mind the fact that I help represent such a big community, and only so little people have the ability to do what I'm trying to do," Agarwal said recently on the sideline of a Stanford practice.
Agarwal said he didn't shy away from a certain amount of pressure that comes with people judging an entire culture based on his play. The high school talent evaluator Rivals.com rated him as a four-star recruit, among the best 150 players in his class. When the time came for Agarwal to announce where he would play in college, he chose to share the spotlight not just with the coaches and relatives who helped him get there, but with India. In a video with dramatic music set to a montage of him walking along train tracks, Agarwal voiced his intention "to set an example for a whole heritage and prove that we can do it, too."
"The commitment video that he did was his thought process, his message that he wanted to say," his mother, Ranjini Agarwalla, said. "It was not anything that we even talked about. So we were shocked when he brought that up and said, 'This is what I want to do."'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
That Agarwal was even recruited out of high school was notable. Only 2 percent of Division I student-athletes identified as Asian in the 2021-22 school year, according to N.C.A.A. statistics. Agarwal's parents said that as he was growing up, it wasn't always clear how they should proceed through the rigorous world of recruiting and elite sports.
"For us, everything was a learning experience," Ashok Agarwal said.
Now, families reach out to them to ask for advice, Ranjini Agarwalla said, partly on how to encourage their children in sports and get them noticed by college coaches.
"I'm blessed with the parents I have, because they put me in every sport possible to just try to see what I love, which honestly, not a lot of Indian parents do," Ryan Agarwal said. "I think that's the biggest thing for me. If it wasn't for the support from my parents, who knows where I would be."
So far this season, Agarwal has come off the bench for Stanford in nearly two-thirds of its games, averaging roughly 8 minutes when he plays. Rivals.com once ranked Agarwal as a top-20 shooting guard, but Stanford Coach Jerod Haase said he considered Agarwal a more complete player because of his size at 6-foot-6 and his passing ability.
"He's going to be really good," Haase said.
Just how good remains to be seen. For now, Agarwal's efforts are focused on helping Stanford (11-16) find its footing in a competitive Pac-12 Conference.
The only player of Indian descent to have logged N.B.A. minutes is the Canadian-born Sim Bhullar, who wasn't drafted but played in three games for the Sacramento Kings during the 2014-15 season. Bhullar now plays in Taiwan.
Singh, billed as a "one in a billion" player in a Netflix documentary, was unable to make it in the N.B.A. He failed to gain traction in the G League, playing only two seasons with the Texas Legends, and never appeared in an N.B.A. game. He is now a performer for All Elite Wrestling.
Since the N.B.A. opened an academy in India in 2017, 20 graduates have earned scholarships to Division I programs, prep schools and junior colleges in the United States, or signed professional contracts, according to a spokesman for the league.
Zach Reynolds, a spokesman for Stanford, said that when he was trying to figure out how many players of Indian descent played Division I men's basketball, he and other sports information directors around the country were able to come up with three: Agarwal, center Amaan Sandhu of Monmouth and the Penn State walk-on player Ishaan Jagiasi.
At Stanford's first home game of the season, 1,500 students from Palo Alto, Calif., elementary and middle schools filed into the stands at Maples Pavilion. Haase said Agarwal took pride in setting an example for kids who were just starting to imagine their futures, like Agarwal was when he watched Singh in Frisco in 2017.
"There's probably a lot of those kids who didn't realize these goals are achievable," Haase said. "Even if it's just coming to a game and seeing someone like Ryan, I think he takes great pride in being that beacon of, 'Hey, work hard, have fun while you're doing it, and there's some great things that can happen."'

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a pairing that seems almost predestined, the actresses are sharing a stage in "The Seagull/Woodstock, NY," a contemporary riff on Chekhov.
In a show-business world full of square pegs and round holes, Parker Posey and Hari Nef are 12-sided dice.
Posey, 54, has forged an unclassifiable career since her days as the "it" girl of 1990s independent cinema -- mirrored in her oddball 2018 book, "You're on an Airplane: A Self-Mythologizing Memoir." She has created a series of indelible characters in Christopher Guest comedies, including "Best in Show," but has also memorably brought her off-kilter rhythms to high-profile gigs like the flamboyant assistant district attorney Freda Black in the HBO Max mini-series "The Staircase" and the scheming Dr. Smith on the Netflix reboot of "Lost in Space."
As for Nef, 30, she landed the recurring role of Gittel in the Amazon series "Transparent" days after graduating from Columbia University, in 2015. The first openly transgender woman to receive a worldwide modeling contract, Nef also writes for various magazines, appeared in the Off Broadway play "Des Moines" in December, and has a couple of big projects arriving later this year: Greta Gerwig's "Barbie" movie and the HBO series "The Idol" in which she'll appear alongside the Weeknd and Lily-Rose Depp.
In a meeting that seems almost predestined, the pair are now sharing a stage in Thomas Bradshaw's "The Seagull/Woodstock, NY," a New Group production in previews at the Pershing Square Signature Center. (It is scheduled to open Feb. 28 and run through March 26.) A contemporary riff on Chekhov set in the Catskills, the play renames the charismatic, brittle actress Irina Arkadina as Irene (Posey), while the moody, romantic Masha has become Sasha (Nef).
"They're iconic in who they are and what they bring to their work," the play's director, Scott Elliott, said of Nef and Posey during a phone call. "They're able to bring themselves to the parts so there's very little separation between the actor and the role. Their humanity peeks through."
This quality helps explain why both New York-based actresses have a similar ability to connect with a character's pathos, while also deploying unerring comic timing: Posey's turns in those Guest films are pitch-perfect, while Nef was praised by Ben Brantley, in his review of Jeremy O. Harris's play "'Daddy,"' for delivering "the production's sharpest satirical performance."
Naturally, there are generational differences. In a chat following a rehearsal, in January, Nef mused about taking Posey to a rave while Posey reminisced about visiting classic ballroom dance halls in Berlin. And yet they connect. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
What did you know of each other before "The Seagull/Woodstock, NY"?
PARKER POSEY Hari Nef -- oh, she was in "Transparent." I remembered exactly what a performance that was and how much she lit up a scene. She changed the temperature of the room. I don't keep up with a lot of things. I don't have a lot of social media -- I forgot my Instagram password a while ago and I tried to sign on a few times with the password I thought I remembered. But of course it was the wrong password.
HARI NEF I knew so much about your work. "Party Girl" is a favorite, but I'd also seen you on "Search Party," the whole gamut. A friend of mine said that you in "The House of Yes" is probably one of the greatest screen performances he's ever seen. And he doesn't play.
POSEY When we met for the first read-through, Thomas said, "I've just got to tell you, 'The House of Yes' was a big inspiration for me and my writing." That [script] was Wendy MacLeod's Yale thesis. I didn't know that playwriting can be so subversive.
NEF I was always so attracted to you and your work because you were glamorous and you were dramatic and you were cool and you were distinctive and uncompromising, but not in a way that was obvious or traditional. You are beautiful and talented, that is obvious and traditional, but you always did things your way. I knew that if I was going to make a career as an actor, much less as an actress, I would have to do things non-traditionally. I didn't have anyone quite exactly like me to look to so I looked at your work and I looked at Tilda [Swinton] and Chloë [Sevigny].
POSEY I got lucky because at a time in the culture, you could do Off Broadway and afford your $ 700 a month apartment. And you could do independent movies: "It's only 22 days, yeah, I'll do that one." It was kind of punk rock or like being in a band. Everyone was hanging out together and it was very organic. It was a little pocket of time that didn't last that long.
NEF I've been able to spend my entire fall and winter doing Off Broadway shows because I did Fashion Week before this and that visibility brings other opportunities. You can get paid three, four, five times what I'm going to make for both these plays combined by going to one dinner and being photographed there in an outfit. I post images of the films I like on Instagram not just because I find them inspiring and beautiful -- I do -- but it's me going, "I want to be in movies like this."
POSEY You're having the best of both worlds because to be online and have a social media presence is kind of to be your own magazine. I need to learn. But that time is a different time; it is your generation's time right now.
NEF You're literally from the last moment where it was possible to be cool. Looking at that capital-C definition of cool all the way back to Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground, there's talent, there's glamour, there's drive, there's darkness. But there's also a mystery and a specificity, and you lose that mystery and specificity by existing online. Because of the money thing and the rent thing, it has become essentially untenable to be cool, to be mysterious, to have that allure being an indie legend.
Do you think it's one thing to be perceived as cool and another to be taken seriously as an actor?
NEF So much of my entry into this industry and this practice was around "Transparent." I was riding on this flotilla of discourse about things that had nothing to do with what I could do as an actor. I thought I had to sing for my supper just for a seat at the table. Maybe I was right, to a certain extent, but it became like, "Do I really want people to know me by what I say or what I am or what my private medical history is?" No, I want to be known for what I do as an actor.
POSEY Cool is when there's something original or unexpected, or seems to have some kind of luck around it. Which your appearing on that show was: the unexpected, something new, something fresh. And that is not orchestrated -- that's luck. I see that now. I look at life and the path of an actor as having that luck. And I think that's very enviable.
NEF I've been very lucky. I remain lucky. The play I did before "Daddy" was my senior thesis in college: I played Arkadina in "The Seagull." I had gone through what I had gone through in college and I never thought that I would get to go onstage to do Chekhov, much less play her. I knew that I probably wouldn't be able to play a role like that again for many, many years -- not because of age but because of the size and the heft of the role. I haven't played a role like Arkadina since then, but I'm back doing "The Seagull" and that is more than was promised to me at that moment in history.
Parker, what drew you to Arkadina/Irene?
POSEY What attracted me the most to this part was the narcissistic mother, and the power that a mother has over her son. And she's a showbiz mom, someone with a lot of heart and theatricality and all that. I'm so lucky as a middle-aged woman to be playing this part. It's interesting to observe how quick people are to villainize strong women, how fun it is to see the worst. People love to call someone a bitch. I mean, the misogyny is on fire, still.
NEF I play a lot of bitches.
Why do you think that is?
NEF Well, I'm no ingénue. I write, and a lot of the bitches I've played are also writers, thinkers. Smart. "Bitch" is often a fill-in for intelligent, for articulate, for opinionated, queer, not conventionally feminine or not conventionally beautiful. I think the "Barbie" stuff happened because I didn't play bitchy and I didn't play dumb and I didn't play plastic in the audition.
POSEY Having been cast as a female Dr. Smith, that was such a coup, I was so grateful for that gig. If you can live in Hollywood, it's a lot easier to get cast and be a part of that world. But I wanted to walk around and see other people.
NEF What is your relationship to the word "scene-stealer"? It's the word that really follows me. It's not a bad thing: It means I'm doing good work in small roles.
POSEY That is a character actor making strong choices. When you have a small role in something big, you have to fill it in a certain way, and that's its own thing.
NEF If you're a bold flavor -- which I know I am -- it's more intuitive for people to see you as seasoning to the steak. I'd like to be the steak someday, but I know I have to earn it. So many of your iconic roles have been supporting and I'm wondering if you ever felt minimized by it.
POSEY [long pause] Your 20s are really intense and then the culture changes and you're, like, "Where am I going to fit in? I'm going to be in 'Blade: Trinity' playing a vampire? Never thought I'd see the day but yeah, I want to work and that'll be interesting." And then it's the 40s. It's heartbreaking when you become aware of just how intensely male-dominated our stories are, especially when you mature as a person and as a woman.
NEF The shifts in the culture are by and large cosmetic when it comes to power and who gets the green light and who gets the sign-off for studio things. I can't control the way I'm cast or how people see me.
POSEY But you can see and acknowledge where you are. You're in the mix. We're so lucky to do what we love to do. A lot of people don't.
NEF That's the bottom line of gratitude right now. This sounds corny but every day I'm so grateful to be here with you, to be here with everyone, to work through this winter onstage. It's not guaranteed for anyone, much less someone like me or you.

Margaret Heagarty, 88, Champion For Children's Health in Harlem: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The first white woman to head the pediatrics unit at Harlem Hospital, she was challenged by the epidemics of crack cocaine and H.I.V.
Dr. Margaret Heagarty was familiar enough with poverty and disease when she went to work in Harlem in 1978. She had grown up in the hardscrabble coal fields of West Virginia, where her father was a physician to miners and their families. She had also been separated from her parents, like many children in Harlem, and placed in an orphanage.
But for all the similarities, the contrasts were striking: She was the first white doctor and the first woman appointed director of pediatrics at Harlem Hospital Center.
Dr. Heagarty, who died on Dec. 23 at her home in the Bronx at 88, won Harlem over. Her death was confirmed by William Burgan, her brother-in-law.
In her 22 years at Harlem Hospital, a public institution run by New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation and affiliated with Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, Dr. Heagarty made a name for herself as an eloquent and effective champion for children's health. She fought for causes like reducing teenage pregnancies and playground injuries.
Thanks in part to her efforts and other community programs, the infant mortality rate in Central Harlem dropped dramatically during her tenure. From 1990 to 2008, the number of babies born there who died before their first birthday plunged from about 28 a year to fewer than seven.
She also enlisted Diana, Princess of Wales; Barbara Bush, the first lady; and Dr. C. Everett Koop, the surgeon general, to rally public support nationally for combating two of the newest scourges her department faced: cocaine-exposed babies abandoned by drug-addicted parents, and H.I.V.-infected infants and young people.
"She was a mountain of an Irishwoman, a mother superior in disguise," said Dr. Stephen W. Nicholas, who succeeded Dr. Heagarty as the director of pediatrics at Harlem Hospital and who is now president of the Children's Global Health Fund. "In her no-nonsense way, she captured the imagination of many, including a princess, a first lady and a surgeon general, to address the plight of children in Harlem during the ravages of AIDS and crack during the 1980s."
Hundreds of miles divided West Virginia from Harlem. But Dr. Heagarty discovered that the common cause of helping the next generation survive trumped any disparities in distance, race or gender.
Margaret Caroline Heagarty was born on Sept. 8, 1934, in Charleston, W.Va., the oldest of three children of Dr. John Patrick Heagarty, who practiced in Ward, a tiny company-owned coal town, and Margaret Caroline (Walsh) Heagarty, a nurse. The household was racked by alcohol abuse and addiction, Mr. Burgan said, and she and her sister were placed in an orphanage when they were teenagers.
After earning a bachelor's degree from Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pa. (formerly a Roman Catholic women's college and now Seton Hill University), she became one of two women attending West Virginia University's two-year School of Medicine. She earned her medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1961.
Dr. Heagarty completed a pediatric residency at Temple University with St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in Philadelphia in 1964. She then accepted a fellowship in child health at Harvard University and served as director of pediatric ambulatory care services of what is now NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital before joining Harlem Hospital.
There, Dr. Heagarty inherited a department with an infant mortality rate more than three times the national average, a demoralized faculty, decrepit facilities and new challenges posed by the epidemics of crack cocaine and AIDS.
"It's one thing to preach from the ivory tower what's good for the poor," said Dr. Janet Stewart Claman, associate professor emerita of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who met Dr. Heagarty when they were both residents. "It's another to go into one of the poorest hospitals in America in one of the most afflicted neighborhoods and try to accomplish something."
"Maggie was a doer," Dr. Claman said by email. "She believed it was better to err by commission than omission. She was often underestimated; she could play the role of a country girl from West Virginia to the hilt, and she physically reminded one of a maiden aunt. But Maggie had a mind like a steel trap, and she always knew her facts."
Not long after Dr. Heagarty arrived, as many as 15 percent of the babies born at Harlem Hospital were testing positive for cocaine, ingested by their mothers, and as many as 4 percent of the pregnant women were infected with H.I.V. Babies languished for months because foster parents feared contagion, stigma and behavioral issues related to addiction. In her early years at the hospital, Dr. Nicholas said, admissions for gunshots and stabbings quadrupled.
"There are times when my wards look more like a battlefield than a pediatric unit," Dr. Heagarty once wrote.
But if caring for Harlem's children was a battle, she was an unrelenting fighter.
She helped reduce the hospital's infant mortality rate to the New York City norm. To care for children with AIDS, she, along with Msgr. Tom Leonard, Sister Una McCormack and the real estate developer and philanthropist Jack Rudin, founded Incarnation Children's Center. She also established a network of five neighborhood satellite health clinics in Harlem and a group home for H.I.V.-infected children.
In 1989, she escorted Princess Diana on a tour of the hospital's pediatric AIDS unit, an event depicted in the Netflix series "The Crown." The princess was quoted as asking, "When you have a problem with the drugs, how on earth do you deal with AIDS as well?"
Her response, Dr. Nicholas recalled, was: "It is bad enough to have a fatal disease, but with poverty and drugs, you have a very bad problem indeed. It is easy to say that these mothers are irresponsible, but still, I have seen them grieving over their dying children. These mothers love their children the same as you love your little princes."
In 1993, Dr. Heagarty, who was also a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University, received a Ronald McDonald House Charities award of $ 100,000. She donated it to the Harlem Hospital pediatrics unit.
Dr. Heagarty never married. In addition to Mr. Burgan, her survivors include several nieces and nephews.
Dr. Heagarty's strategy could be unorthodox, her manner blunt. Dr. Nicholas recalled that when Dr. Heagarty was president of the hospital's medical board from 1992 to 1995, she strongly disagreed with a new department director, who was Black.
The director turned to a Columbia dean, Dr. Nicholas recalled, and asked, "Is Dr. Heagarty racist?"
"Oh, no," the dean replied. "Dr. Heagarty's not racist. She treats everyone that way."
Dr. Heagarty, left, enlisted Princess Diana, second from left, who visited the hospital in 1989, to help bring attention to the struggles it faced. She also established five health clinics in Harlem.

Full text: In the mix this month are hour sets from a maturing Marc Maron, a very funny Nathan Macintosh and a pandering Roseanne Barr.
Marc Maron, 'From Bleak to Dark'
HBO Max
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In his new hour, Marc Maron says he refuses to outgrow blaming his parents for his problems. "They did it," he grumbles, concisely. His graying hair bouncing off a dark leather jacket, Maron, 59, has remained a vital comic voice by staying in touch with his inner brooding teen. And yet, don't be fooled: Maron is maturing. His comedy has become more intricate, varied in timing and tone, and politically astute. After decades of leaning over stools, his years of touring theaters -- and perhaps film work -- have turned him into more of a showman, with a repertoire of small scenes, satires (his spoof of the TED Talk is pitch perfect) and act-outs.
The emotional centerpiece of his new special is the 2020 death of his partner, the director Lynn Shelton. Here is where he really shows his evolution, because he handles this passage with a light touch, humbly and without the melodramatic negativity of his title. What stands out is his lack of philosophizing or waxing poetic. There's a lot of art, including comedy, that exploits the gravity of death. And why not? Our greatest play, "Hamlet," is about a neurotic, grief-struck young man who can't stop obsessing over the death of a loved one. But Maron brings an older man's perspective. He tells us he's not the victim. Shelton is. He calls his loss ordinary, common. Can art help? People send him "The Year of Magical Thinking," and it does nothing for him except make him compare himself unfavorably to Joan Didion.
What does help, he says, is "the Jewish thing." Maron has long been fascinated by religion and spirituality, but this hour is his most Jewish by far, featuring the most jokes on the religion, including punch lines about the Holocaust and antisemitism. He says he finds solace in the Jewish epithet "May her memory be a blessing." This phrase, dating at least to the Talmud, contrasts with the Jewish stereotypes of neurosis and kvetching. Maron pokes fun at the idea of him doing an emotional Jewish one-man show about the death of his girlfriend, but in a way, he has done it -- or at least, his version. Looking to the wisdom of religion is perhaps the most hack move possible, but one of the things you learn as you get older is that clichés exist for a reason.
Nathan Macintosh, 'Money Never Wakes'
YouTube
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
When it comes to stand-up specials, it's a "best of times, worst of times" situation. There have never been more being made, released and available to a global audience than right now. According to Sean McCarthy's newsletter Piffany, there have already been 55 released this year -- more than one a day. While most hours are terrible, rote or entirely mediocre, there are gems that would have remained entirely obscure in previous eras.
Take Nathan Macintosh, an inauspicious-looking blond guy dressed in khaki pants, a white T-shirt and a button down. His new hour did not get picked up by any major platform, but you can watch it free on YouTube and, if you're like me, convulse with laughter. His jokes won't translate well to the page because his delivery is so eccentrically goofy while still managing a momentum that keeps building and building. His main mode is end-of-your-rope exasperation, with eyes popping, voice squeaking and a jittery physicality. He can be funny on mute.
The panic in his voice is a perfect match for his preoccupation: The confusing way money works and the infuriating inequities of class. That makes him sound didactic, but his jokes stay close to the ground and unexpected, sympathizing with much-mocked figures like landlords or subway drivers. There's a novelistic detail in his description of his own apartment, with rats scurrying above the ceiling. ("Have you ever heard rats above you having a better life?") His self-loathing bit on losing money on crypto is a wonderful time capsule of our moment.
But his funniest jokes are about the pampered rich, whom he portrays as aliens speaking to one another and oblivious of everyone else. In dark comic set pieces, they are forced into contact with ordinary people, who must treat them with extreme deference. He acts out one scene in which a rich person complains about his chicken being cold at a fancy restaurant. The manager says with practiced professionalism, "Look, we'll have the waiter murdered in front of his family."
Roseanne Barr, 'Cancel This!'
Fox Nation
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In the oral history "We Killed: The Rise of Women in Comedy," Roseanne Barr explained how she adjusted her stand-up act in the 1980s to fit in with comedy clubs. "I had to make it less political and more mainstream," she said. This clearly worked. Barr became one of the most successful comics in history, turning her fed-up housewife persona into one of the best sitcoms of the era. But now, several years after an offensive tweet led to her being fired from a reboot of that show, Barr has adjusted again by becoming more political, aggressively courting right-wing audiences as a conspiracy-minded victim of cancel culture.
Her new special, which arrives on the Fox Nation streaming service, feels like a mix of rally and fan convention, with some stand-up sprinkled on top. Barr, who alternates between long pauses and flashes of anger, gets an applause break from saying "Baby blood drinking Democrat community" and a big laugh from "I don't want to talk to no Hillary donors." It's a balky production, with abrupt edits and occasional tangents that belong more to the green room than the stage, like an extended gripe about doing promos for her sitcom.
It's the culture war material, though, that gets her crowd fired up. She berates #MeToo victims, suggests that taking the vaccine will prevent you from getting pregnant, and in bemoaning the decline of men, orders the ones in her audience to tell their wives and girlfriends to sit down, shut up and make them a sandwich. Barr says she plans to offend, but this has become another pander, since obviously her crowd loves the grievances, the resentments. She even clarifies that she likes doing promos for Fox.
Watch Barr's early sets and you will find not only a quick comic mind, but also tightly written jokes. Neither appear here. Of course, it's not just Barr who has changed. Comedy has, too. The scene is more political, polarized, desperate for outrage. Jim Jeffries prefaces the trans jokes in his new Netflix special by saying he's doing them because he wants the press that Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais received. I'm sure he'd say it's a joke, but I believe it. When Barr trots out a stale gag about gender, riffing on the question "What is a woman?" she gets a predictable roar. It's a reminder that Barr once ran for president, and how much comedy and politics have blurred. Cheap nostalgia can be powerful in both arenas. At one point, Barr jokes, "The world has changed a lot since I was alive."

Full text: The fantasy card game has surpassed the sales of the 100-year-old company's other brands, including Transformers and G.I. Joe, but some are worried about the downsides of rapid growth.
Richard Neal has been playing Magic: The Gathering, a fantasy card game, for nearly two decades. Two or three nights a week, he heads to Mox Boarding House, a game store in Bellevue, Wash., wielding a deck he has painstakingly built over the years.
"I go there probably more than my fiancé would like," said Mr. Neal, a 31-year-old software engineer for Apple. His devotion, and that of millions of other fans, has helped Hasbro steadily build the game into a global behemoth.
On Thursday, the company announced that Magic had become its first billion-dollar brand in terms of annual sales, surpassing other toy lines in its stable, like Transformers and G.I. Joe.
That milestone was achieved after 30 years of nurturing the game for longtime fans while finding ways to coax new players to pick it up. It was a "winning playbook," as Chris Cocks, the chief executive of Hasbro, put it in an interview.
Since it was introduced in the mid-1990s, more than 50 million people -- including the rapper Post Malone and the actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt -- have played Magic in hobby shops and around kitchen tables around the world. The game casts players as wizards who derive their powers by picking cards from the decks they have built, drawing from an ever-expanding universe of cards that are bought, sold and traded in a thriving secondary market. Magic's popularity has spawned a cottage industry of video games, comic books, a Caribbean cruise and an animated series in development for Netflix.
On Friday, Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro unit that publishes the game, will kick off MagicCon in Philadelphia.
After the initial buzz when it first appeared, Magic flew under the radar for many years, said Gerrick Johnson, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets who covers the toy industry. "Now you get to see how big it is," he added. "I don't think there is any toy brand that is even half that size."
But Hasbro faces challenges making Magic even bigger, particularly player fatigue brought on by the release of 39 new card sets last year, up from 15 in 2019, according to an analysis by Bank of America. New sets can start around $ 50.
With consumers squeezed by inflation and economic growth slowing down, Hasbro's reliance on Magic for growth has taken on a new urgency. On Thursday, the toymaker reported a loss of nearly $ 130 million in the fourth quarter, versus a profit of more than $ 80 million in the same period a year before, as consumers spent less on toys during the crucial holiday shopping season. Last month, the company said it would lay off 15 percent of its workers as it sought to cut up to $ 300 million in costs.
Magic generated nearly $ 1.1 billion in revenue in 2022, up 7 percent from the year before. The game accounted for 18 percent of Hasbro's overall revenue last year, higher than its 16 percent share in 2021.
Magic, which was created in 1993 by a mathematician, Richard Garfield, was the first modern trading card game, combining "the excitement of cards with the thrill of trading and collecting," according to Guinness World Records. Its success helped inspire other games, notably Pokémon.
Themed sets and booster packs for Magic are sold at 6,500 mom-and-pop game stores like Mox Boarding House that are part of Hasbro's Wizards Play Network, as well as in mass retailers like Amazon, Target and Walmart.
"Magic is a complicated game, and we try to demystify that," said Mary Holocher, the operations manager at Mox Boarding House, which has three stores in the Seattle area and is planning to open another in Chandler, Ariz.
In 2019, Wizards of the Coast released Magic: The Gathering Arena, a digital version of the game, which attracted players when pandemic restrictions kept them at home. "It's been our most valuable tool for engaging new players," Mr. Cocks said.
Mr. Neal tries not to miss Mox's Friday Night Magic event, a tournament for amateur players that is organized by the Wizards Play Network. He is aiming for a spot on Hasbro's pro tour, but that requires a strong deck, which can take time and money to build.
He estimated that he spent $ 20,000 on Magic last year. "I buy a lot of cards," he said.
As Magic expands, it is drawing new audiences to venues like Mox, which embraces inclusion and diversity. "I am a nonbinary person, and traditionally the scene is male dominated," said Katelyn Hassan, 34, a stay-at-home parent who went to Mox last Friday to play Magic competitively for the first time. "If I go anywhere to do this, I'm going to go there."
As players seek the strongest cards to bolster their decks, they often turn to the secondary market, buying and selling cards at stores like Mox and on websites like TCGplayer.com.
"Last year, I sold a couple of cards that I had in my collection for a long time," said Chris Crilley, a 34-year-old Target employee in Wantagh, N.Y. "They were just sitting there, and I realized one was a $ 500 card."
Some cards can fetch far more: The most valuable card is the Black Lotus, which was sold at auction in 2021 for more than $ 500,000. But some players say they have become concerned that an oversupply of card sets is diluting the value of their collections.
In November, a Bank of America report took Hasbro to task for what it saw as an overly busy release schedule, saying it lowered the value of Magic cards and weakened the franchise. Hasbro's shares fell 10 percent the day the report was released, underscoring how important the card game has become to the 100-year-old company.
Mr. Johnson, the BMO analyst, agreed that flooding the market could hurt a collectible brand like Magic. "If you have a weak secondary market, that weakens the primary market, too," he said. "Collectors get disillusioned; that's the worst thing that could happen."
Hasbro's stock has fallen 40 percent over the past year, lagging rival toymaker Mattel as well as the broader stock market.
Hasbro has defended its strategy, saying it is necessary to attract new players. That includes a series called Universes Beyond, which incorporates other franchises into Magic like Final Fantasy, Lord of the Rings and Doctor Who. The release of a Warhammer 40,000 crossover set last year was seen as a major success. "We couldn't keep it in stock," said Ms. Holocher of Mox.
"That's a nice area of growth for us," Mr. Cocks said of the brand extensions. But he added that Hasbro took Bank of America's warning about overproduction seriously. "I don't think you can be a winning team unless you can be open to self-reflection," he said.
But Mr. Cocks said he was confident in the staying power of Magic. "When you look at the long sweep of 30 years -- same-store sales, the value of the product, the size of the business -- in general, everything is going in the right direction," he said.

Margaret Heagarty, Champion for Children’s Health in Harlem, Dies at 88

Dr. Margaret Heagarty was familiar enough with poverty and disease when she went to work in New York City in 1978. She had grown up in the hardscrabble coal fields of West Virginia, where her father was a physician to miners and their families. She had also been separated from her parents, like many children in Harlem, and placed in an orphanage.
But for all the similarities, the contrasts were striking: She was the first white doctor and the first woman appointed director of pediatrics at Harlem Hospital Center.
Heagarty, who died Dec. 23 at her home in the Bronx at 88, won Harlem over. Her death was confirmed by William Burgan, her brother-in-law,
In her 22 years at Harlem Hospital, a public institution run by New York City’s Health and Hospitals Corp. and affiliated with Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons, Heagarty made a name for herself as an eloquent and effective champion for children’s health. She fought for causes like reducing teenage pregnancies and playground injuries.
Thanks in part to her efforts and other community programs, the infant mortality rate in Central Harlem dropped dramatically during her tenure. From 1990 to 2008, the number of babies born there who died before their first birthday plunged from about 28 a year to fewer than seven.
She also enlisted Diana, Princess of Wales; Barbara Bush, the first lady; and Dr. C. Everett Koop, the surgeon general, to rally public support nationally for combating two of the newest scourges her department faced: cocaine-exposed babies abandoned by drug-addicted parents, and HIV-infected infants and young people.
“She was a mountain of an Irishwoman, a mother superior in disguise,” said Dr. Stephen W. Nicholas, who succeeded Heagarty as the director of pediatrics at Harlem Hospital and is now president of the Children’s Global Health Fund. “In her no-nonsense way, she captured the imagination of many, including a princess, a first lady and a surgeon general, to address the plight of children in Harlem during the ravages of AIDS and crack during the 1980s.”
Hundreds of miles divided West Virginia from Harlem. But Heagarty discovered that the common cause of helping the next generation survive trumped any disparities in distance, race or gender.
Margaret Caroline Heagarty was born Sept. 8, 1934, in Charleston, West Virginia, the oldest of three children of Dr. John Patrick Heagarty, who practiced in Ward, a tiny company-owned coal town, and Margaret Caroline (Walsh) Heagarty, a nurse. The household was racked by alcohol abuse and addiction, Burgan said, and she and her sister were placed in an orphanage when they were teenagers.
After earning a bachelor’s degree from Seton Hill College in Greensburg, Pennsylvania (formerly a Roman Catholic women’s college and now Seton Hill University), she became one of two women attending West Virginia University’s two-year School of Medicine and then earned her medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1961.
She completed a pediatric residency at Temple University with St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia in 1964. She then accepted a fellowship in child health at Harvard University and served as director of pediatric ambulatory care services of what is now NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital before joining Harlem Hospital.
Heagarty inherited a department with an infant mortality rate more than three times the national average, a demoralized faculty, decrepit facilities and new challenges posed by the epidemics of crack cocaine and AIDS.
“It’s one thing to preach from the ivory tower what’s good for the poor,” said Dr. Janet Stewart Claman, associate professor emerita of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who met Heagarty when they were both residents. “It’s another to go into one of the poorest hospitals in America in one of the most afflicted neighborhoods and try to accomplish something.”
“Maggie was a doer,” Claman said by email. “She believed it was better to err by commission than omission. She was often underestimated; she could play the role of a country girl from West Virginia to the hilt, and she physically reminded one of a maiden aunt. But Maggie had a mind like a steel trap, and she always knew her facts.”
Not long after Heagarty arrived, as many as 15% of the babies born at Harlem Hospital were testing positive for cocaine, ingested by their mothers, and as many as 4% of the pregnant women were infected with HIV. Babies languished for months because foster parents feared contagion, stigma and behavioral issues related to addiction. In her early years at the hospital, Nicholas said, admissions for gunshots and stabbings quadrupled.
“There are times when my wards look more like a battlefield than a pediatric unit,” Heagarty once wrote.
But if caring for Harlem’s children was a battle, she was an unrelenting fighter.
She helped reduce the hospital’s infant mortality rate to the New York City norm. To care for children with AIDS, she, along with Monsignor Tom Leonard, Sister Una McCormack, and real estate developer and philanthropist Jack Rudin, founded Incarnation Children’s Center. She also established a network of five neighborhood satellite health clinics in Harlem and a group home for HIV-infected children.
In 1989, she escorted Princess Diana on a tour of the hospital’s pediatric AIDS unit, an event depicted in the Netflix series “The Crown.” The princess was quoted as asking, “When you have a problem with the drugs, how on earth do you deal with AIDS as well?”
Her response, Nicholas recalled, was: “It is bad enough to have a fatal disease, but with poverty and drugs, you have a very bad problem indeed. It is easy to say that these mothers are irresponsible, but still, I have seen them grieving over their dying children. These mothers love their children the same as you love your little princes.”
In 1993, Heagarty, who was also a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University, received a Ronald McDonald House Charities award of $100,000. She donated it to the Harlem Hospital pediatrics unit.
Heagarty never married. In addition to Burgan, her survivors include several nieces and nephews.
Heagarty’s strategy could be unorthodox, her manner blunt. Nicholas recalled that when Heagarty was president of the hospital’s medical board from 1992-95, she strongly disagreed with a new department director, who was Black.
The director turned to a Columbia dean, Nicholas recalled, and asked, “Is Dr. Heagarty racist?”
“Oh, no,” the dean replied. “Dr. Heagarty’s not racist. She treats everyone that way.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Hari Nef and Parker Posey: Two ‘It’ Girls Whose ‘Humanity Peeks Through’

Abstract: None available.

NEW YORK — In a show-business world full of square pegs and round holes, Parker Posey and Hari Nef are 12-sided dice.
Posey, 54, has forged an unclassifiable career since her days as the “it” girl of 1990s independent cinema — mirrored in her oddball 2018 book, “You’re on an Airplane: A Self-Mythologizing Memoir.” She has created a series of indelible characters in Christopher Guest comedies, including “Best in Show,” but has also memorably brought her off-kilter rhythms to high-profile gigs like the flamboyant assistant district attorney Freda Black in the HBO Max miniseries “The Staircase” and the scheming Dr. Smith on the Netflix reboot of “Lost in Space.”
As for Nef, 30, she landed the recurring role of Gittel in the Amazon series “Transparent” days after graduating from Columbia University, in 2015. The first openly transgender woman to receive a worldwide modeling contract, Nef also writes for various magazines, appeared in the off-Broadway play “Des Moines” in December, and has a couple of big projects arriving later this year: Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” movie and the HBO series “The Idol” in which she’ll appear alongside the Weeknd and Lily-Rose Depp.
In a meeting that seems almost predestined, the pair are now sharing a stage in Thomas Bradshaw’s “The Seagull/Woodstock, NY,” a New Group production in previews at the Pershing Square Signature Center. (It is scheduled to open Feb. 28 and run through March 26.) A contemporary riff on Chekhov set in the Catskills, the play renames the charismatic, brittle actress Irina Arkadina as Irene (Posey), while the moody, romantic Masha has become Sasha (Nef).
“They’re iconic in who they are and what they bring to their work,” the play’s director, Scott Elliott, said of Nef and Posey during a phone call. “They’re able to bring themselves to the parts so there’s very little separation between the actor and the role. Their humanity peeks through.”
This quality helps explain why both New York-based actresses have a similar ability to connect with a character’s pathos, while also deploying unerring comic timing: Posey’s turns in those Guest films are pitch-perfect, while Nef was praised by Ben Brantley, in his review of Jeremy O. Harris’ play “‘Daddy,’” for delivering “the production’s sharpest satirical performance.”
Naturally, there are generational differences. In a chat following a rehearsal, in January, Nef mused about taking Posey to a rave while Posey reminisced about visiting classic ballroom dance halls in Berlin. And yet they connect. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: What did you know of each other before “The Seagull/Woodstock, NY”?
PARKER POSEY: Hari Nef — oh, she was in “Transparent.” I remembered exactly what a performance that was and how much she lit up a scene. She changed the temperature of the room. I don’t keep up with a lot of things. I don’t have a lot of social media — I forgot my Instagram password a while ago and I tried to sign on a few times with the password I thought I remembered. But of course it was the wrong password.
HARI NEF: I knew so much about your work. “Party Girl” is a favorite, but I’d also seen you on “Search Party,” the whole gamut. A friend of mine said that you in “The House of Yes” is probably one of the greatest screen performances he’s ever seen. And he doesn’t play.
POSEY: When we met for the first read-through, Thomas said, “I’ve just got to tell you, ‘The House of Yes’ was a big inspiration for me and my writing.” That [script] was Wendy MacLeod’s Yale thesis. I didn’t know that playwriting can be so subversive.
NEF: I was always so attracted to you and your work because you were glamorous and you were dramatic and you were cool and you were distinctive and uncompromising, but not in a way that was obvious or traditional. You are beautiful and talented, that is obvious and traditional, but you always did things your way. I knew that if I was going to make a career as an actor, much less as an actress, I would have to do things non-traditionally. I didn’t have anyone quite exactly like me to look to so I looked at your work and I looked at Tilda [Swinton] and Chloë [Sevigny].
POSEY: I got lucky because at a time in the culture, you could do off-Broadway and afford your $700 a month apartment. And you could do independent movies: “It’s only 22 days, yeah, I’ll do that one.” It was kind of punk rock or like being in a band. Everyone was hanging out together and it was very organic. It was a little pocket of time that didn’t last that long.
NEF: I’ve been able to spend my entire fall and winter doing off-Broadway shows because I did Fashion Week before this and that visibility brings other opportunities. You can get paid three, four, five times what I’m going to make for both these plays combined by going to one dinner and being photographed there in an outfit. I post images of the films I like on Instagram not just because I find them inspiring and beautiful — I do — but it’s me going, “I want to be in movies like this.”
POSEY: You’re having the best of both worlds because to be online and have a social media presence is kind of to be your own magazine. I need to learn. But that time is a different time; it is your generation’s time right now.
NEF: You’re literally from the last moment where it was possible to be cool. Looking at that capital-C definition of cool all the way back to Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground, there’s talent, there’s glamour, there’s drive, there’s darkness. But there’s also a mystery and a specificity, and you lose that mystery and specificity by existing online. Because of the money thing and the rent thing, it has become essentially untenable to be cool, to be mysterious, to have that allure being an indie legend.
Q: Do you think it’s one thing to be perceived as cool and another to be taken seriously as an actor?
NEF: So much of my entry into this industry and this practice was around “Transparent.” I was riding on this flotilla of discourse about things that had nothing to do with what I could do as an actor. I thought I had to sing for my supper just for a seat at the table. Maybe I was right, to a certain extent, but it became like, “Do I really want people to know me by what I say or what I am or what my private medical history is?” No, I want to be known for what I do as an actor.
POSEY: Cool is when there’s something original or unexpected, or seems to have some kind of luck around it. Which your appearing on that show was: the unexpected, something new, something fresh. And that is not orchestrated — that’s luck. I see that now. I look at life and the path of an actor as having that luck. And I think that’s very enviable.
NEF: I’ve been very lucky. I remain lucky. The play I did before “Daddy” was my senior thesis in college: I played Arkadina in “The Seagull.” I had gone through what I had gone through in college and I never thought that I would get to go onstage to do Chekhov, much less play her. I knew that I probably wouldn’t be able to play a role like that again for many, many years — not because of age but because of the size and the heft of the role. I haven’t played a role like Arkadina since then, but I’m back doing “The Seagull” and that is more than was promised to me at that moment in history.
Q: Parker, what drew you to Arkadina/Irene?
POSEY: What attracted me the most to this part was the narcissistic mother, and the power that a mother has over her son. And she’s a showbiz mom, someone with a lot of heart and theatricality and all that. I’m so lucky as a middle-aged woman to be playing this part. It’s interesting to observe how quick people are to villainize strong women, how fun it is to see the worst. People love to call someone a bitch. I mean, the misogyny is on fire, still.
NEF: I play a lot of bitches.
Q: Why do you think that is?
NEF: Well, I’m no ingénue. I write, and a lot of the bitches I’ve played are also writers, thinkers. Smart. “Bitch” is often a fill-in for intelligent, for articulate, for opinionated, queer, not conventionally feminine or not conventionally beautiful. I think the “Barbie” stuff happened because I didn’t play bitchy and I didn’t play dumb and I didn’t play plastic in the audition.
POSEY: Having been cast as a female Dr. Smith, that was such a coup, I was so grateful for that gig. If you can live in Hollywood, it’s a lot easier to get cast and be a part of that world. But I wanted to walk around and see other people.
NEF: What is your relationship to the word “scene-stealer”? It’s the word that really follows me. It’s not a bad thing: It means I’m doing good work in small roles.
POSEY: That is a character actor making strong choices. When you have a small role in something big, you have to fill it in a certain way, and that’s its own thing.
NEF: If you’re a bold flavor — which I know I am — it’s more intuitive for people to see you as seasoning to the steak. I’d like to be the steak someday, but I know I have to earn it. So many of your iconic roles have been supporting and I’m wondering if you ever felt minimized by it.
POSEY: [long pause] Your 20s are really intense and then the culture changes and you’re, like, “Where am I going to fit in? I’m going to be in ‘Blade: Trinity’ playing a vampire? Never thought I’d see the day but yeah, I want to work and that’ll be interesting.” And then it’s the 40s. It’s heartbreaking when you become aware of just how intensely male-dominated our stories are, especially when you mature as a person and as a woman.
NEF: The shifts in the culture are by and large cosmetic when it comes to power and who gets the green light and who gets the sign-off for studio things. I can’t control the way I’m cast or how people see me.
POSEY: But you can see and acknowledge where you are. You’re in the mix. We’re so lucky to do what we love to do. A lot of people don’t.
NEF: That’s the bottom line of gratitude right now. This sounds corny but every day I’m so grateful to be here with you, to be here with everyone, to work through this winter onstage. It’s not guaranteed for anyone, much less someone like me or you. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Black Chefs Aim to Restore New Orleans's Hidden History: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: NEW ORLEANS -- The first dish served at Dakar NOLA is called Last Meal. It's a soup of black-eyed peas, crispy rice and Louisiana blue crab, with robust spicing that recalls this city's famous gumbos.
Chances are you'll still be thinking about it days later. Last Meal is that delicious -- and even more unsettling.
It is inspired by ndambe, a dish that Dakar NOLA's chef, Serigne Mbaye, ate while growing up in Senegal. But a version of that dish was also fed to enslaved West Africans just before they boarded ships to the United States.
Last Meal, like the peas fed to those in bondage, contains palm oil, which is high in saturated fat. Kidnapped Africans needed to be "fattened up" before being loaded onto ships, so slaveholders could "protect their investment," Mr. Mbaye explained to about 30 guests in January. He shares this story at the start of every meal at Dakar NOLA, which opened in November.
"I've seen people cry plenty of times when talking to me about the black-eyed pea soup," he said during one of several interviews. "We need to let people know where the food came from. The story isn't always going to be pleasant."
It's a particularly resonant story in a city whose image as a haven of merriment and great food, and as a living portal to history, has been cultivated for well over a century. New Orleans is also a majority Black city that was once the site of the largest slave market in the United States, where by one estimate more than 135,000 people were bought and sold.
Startling racial inequality is not just a fact of the past in New Orleans. Today, the median income of Black households here is 36 percent that of white households, and about half of all Black children live below the poverty line, according to the Data Center, a Louisiana-focused research firm. These disparities are similarly reflected in the amount of acclaim and fortune that flows disproportionately to the city's white chefs and restaurateurs.
Mr. Mbaye created Dakar NOLA expressly to help diners understand the crucial role that enslaved laborers played in creating New Orleans's famous cuisine, and connect that history to the city today.
Mr. Mbaye, 29, is part of a generation of Black chefs and scholars who say they want to dismantle the "whitewashed" stories on which the tourist economy of New Orleans rests -- deeply abridged versions of the past that are at odds with the experiences of Black residents.
Their emphasis on the influence of Europeans, especially the French, is belied by the legacy of Black chefs in New Orleans kitchens, said Lolis Eric Elie, a New Orleans-born writer and food authority who has become a mentor to Mr. Mbaye.
"What does it do to your notions of white superiority, to know this thing that we thought was all French is not all French?" Mr. Elie said. "To know that the creators of this great culinary tradition were people of African descent?"
That legacy extends back to the era of slavery, said Zella Palmer, a food scholar and the director of the Ray Charles Program in African American Material Culture at Dillard University. She pointed out that most of the enslaved people first brought to Louisiana in the early 18th century came from West Africa, including Senegambia, and that Africans sold into slavery were commonly targeted by human traffickers for their specific skills.
"To think they didn't have an influence on this culture is false," Ms. Palmer said. "They had centuries of cultural memory."
Afua Richardson, 42, put her dentistry career on hold to become Mr. Mbaye's business partner at Dakar NOLA. Raised in California by Ghanaian parents, she saw New Orleans cuisine as inherently African from the start.
Ms. Richardson, known as Effie, remembers eating gumbo for the first time on a trip to New Orleans as a teenager. "I said, 'This is okra stew,"' she recalled. "Then I had jambalaya and said, 'This is jollof rice."'
Dakar NOLA is part of a wave of Black-owned African and Caribbean restaurants opening at a time of growing awareness that much of New Orleans culture can be traced to West African and Caribbean antecedents, from its music and architecture to its Carnival traditions and signature dishes like gumbo, jambalaya and étouffée. They include Queen Trini Lisa, whose chef-owner, Lisa Nelson, is a native of Trinidad and Tobago; the Haitian restaurant Fritai, owned by chef Charly Pierre; and the Honduran restaurant Las Delicias de Honduras.
These restaurants are partaking in "a new and expanded telling" of the history of New Orleans cuisine, said Jessica B. Harris, whose books have been instrumental in tracing the food's African roots. (Mr. Mbaye will appear in the next season of "High on the Hog," the Netflix series based on Dr. Harris's book of the same name.)
"This is a widening of the lens," Dr. Harris said.
Filling the local void of African restaurants is why Prince Lobo's family opened Addis NOLA in 2019. Last year, the Ethiopian restaurant moved to a new location in the Seventh Ward, along a stretch of Black-owned businesses that Mr. Lobo calls "a new Black Wall Street." (Robert Manos, in the group picture at top, is a manager at the restaurant, in charge of customer experience.)
"All of the history that was left out over the last hundreds of years, we're having to fill that in now with our storytelling," said Mr. Lobo, 25.
Since opening Compère Lapin in 2015, Nina Compton, who is from St. Lucia, has won national acclaim for food that brings together New Orleans and Caribbean cuisine. Her cooking traces historical connections forged by proximity, trade and the arrival of Haitians who doubled the city's population in the early 19th century.
Ms. Compton, 44, helped usher in a new era for Black leaders in the New Orleans food community. Since George Floyd was murdered in 2020, she has noticed an uptick in customers responding to more than just her food.
"There was this wave of Black pride," she said, "of people coming in saying, 'I want to support you because you're Black, and I want to see you thrive."'
Ms. Compton, Mr. Mbaye and others follow a path paved most prominently by Leah Chase. Mrs. Chase, who died in 2019, made her family's Creole restaurant, Dooky Chase's, into a monument of Black excellence during segregation. Throughout her career, she served as a reminder of the years Black chefs prepared the food in white-owned restaurants where they were prohibited from dining.
Mrs. Chase filled a vacuum in a city historically resistant to shine a light on dark aspects of its past. (Unlike Montgomery and Birmingham, Ala., and Jackson, Miss., New Orleans has no civil rights museum, though the National World War II Museum brought in over $ 62 million in revenue in 2020.) That her family owned Dooky Chase's allowed her to take credit for her accomplishments.
Her grandson, Edgar Chase IV, is the restaurant's executive chef and recently opened a new restaurant, Chapter IV; Zoe Chase, her great-granddaughter, is training to take over as the chef and face of Dooky Chase's.
Mrs. Chase cooked for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and charmed U.S. presidents. But Milton Prudence's experiences are more representative of Black chefs in New Orleans.
Mr. Prudence, 75, began his career at Galatoire's, a white-owned counterpart to Dooky Chase's. The restaurant, opened by the Frenchman Jean Galatoire in 1905, is central to the city's culinary reputation. Mr. Prudence worked there for 34 years, 14 as its head chef, churning out emblematic versions of signature dishes like trout amandine, shrimp rémoulade and turtle soup. He is not credited in either of the two Galatoire's cookbooks.
Mr. Prudence recalled his job interview at Galatoire's in 1968, when he was disturbed to find the words "white" and "colored" still visible on the bathroom stalls. He told the owner, who agreed to have the signs removed.
"That was one of the reasons I decided to work there," he said.
Mr. Prudence said he isn't bothered that he is not better known as a master of French-Creole cuisine. "I was in a situation where I had to raise five girls," he said. "Owning my own restaurant was one of the things that I had to sacrifice."
Mr. Mbaye came to New Orleans to work at another renowned pillar of New Orleans cuisine: Commander's Palace, where Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse got their start. It's the restaurant most responsible for moving New Orleans fine dining past the tradition-bound cooking of Galatoire's. But Mr. Mbaye's path is different from that of chefs who came before him.
Born in Harlem and raised in Senegal, Mr. Mbaye first learned to cook from his Senegalese mother, Khady Kante, before graduating at the top of his class from culinary school in Vermont.
At Commander's and its sister restaurant, Café Adelaide, he rose quickly through the ranks, while also proving himself an eager student outside the kitchen.
An early break came in 2017, when Howard Conyers, the local pitmaster, writer and NASA scientist, let Mr. Mbaye cook at an event with Pierre Thiam, the Senegalese chef and cookbook author. The dinner proved that diners would show up for Senegalese cuisine.
Mr. Mbaye went on to cook at the Michelin-starred Atelier Crenn in San Francisco and L'Atelier de Joël Robouchon in New York, but a prolonged overseas tour in 2019, with stops in Europe and Africa, really focused his cooking and education.
On a visit to the island of Gorée, a former slave market off the coast of Senegal, Mr. Mbaye learned about the dish that would become Last Meal.
"I connected with how my ancestors used to live, and connected it to New Orleans," he said.
Because he and Ms. Richardson are first-time restaurateurs and not from New Orleans originally, they have been intentional about building community.
"We need to know the history of the Black people in the food spaces here and what their experience has been," Ms. Richardson said. "This is their city."
Martha Wiggins, the chief culinary officer at Café Reconcile, a nonprofit restaurant that helps teenagers and young adults develop job skills, said Mr. Mbaye "has a talent for befriending people who are like-minded." Meeting him, she said, helped her realize "I needed to find community with other Black and brown folks in this business."
Meals at Dakar NOLA begin with ataya tea and the tableside washing of hands, as they did in the chef's home growing up. The story about the slaves is presented not as a provocation, but as a somber fact among many other, less grave ones -- about the local shrimp draped in tamarind sauce, or how jollof rice is a precursor to jambalaya.
By framing his cooking in historical, often memoiristic terms, Mr. Mbaye joins a cadre of Black chefs across the country -- among them Mashama Bailey in Savannah, Ga., Gregory Gourdet, in Portland, Ore., and Kwame Onwuachi, in New York -- rethinking popular narratives about the origins of American cuisine.
"I just want people to recognize our food the same way they do other food," Mr. Mbaye said. "I want people to leave feeling inspired."
Zella Palmer, the food scholar, has little doubt that many of Dakar's diners are shedding tears of joy.
"Serigne is 29 years-old, and he just opened up this amazing Senegalese restaurant on Magazine Street," she said. "The ancestors are dancing."

Born in Harlem in New York City and raised in Senegal, Mbaye first learned to cook from his Senegalese mother, Khady Kante, before graduating at the top of his class from culinary school in Vermont.
At Commander’s and its sister restaurant, Café Adelaide, he rose quickly through the ranks, while also proving himself an eager student outside the kitchen.
An early break came in 2017, when Howard Conyers, the local pitmaster, writer and NASA scientist, let Mbaye cook at an event with Pierre Thiam, the Senegalese chef and cookbook author. The dinner proved that diners would show up for Senegalese cuisine.
Mbaye went on to cook at the Michelin-starred Atelier Crenn in San Francisco and L’Atelier de Joël Robouchon in New York, but a prolonged overseas tour in 2019, with stops in Europe and Africa, really focused his cooking and education.
On a visit to the island of Gorée, a former slave market off the coast of Senegal, Mbaye learned about the dish that would become Last Meal.
“I connected with how my ancestors used to live, and connected it to New Orleans,” he said.
Because he and Richardson are first-time restaurateurs and not from New Orleans originally, they have been intentional about building community.
“We need to know the history of the Black people in the food spaces here and what their experience has been,” Richardson said. “This is their city.”
Martha Wiggins, the chief culinary officer at Café Reconcile, a nonprofit restaurant that helps teenagers and young adults develop job skills, said Mbaye “has a talent for befriending people who are like-minded.” Meeting him, she said, helped her realize “I needed to find community with other Black and brown folks in this business.”
Meals at Dakar NOLA begin with ataya tea and the tableside washing of hands, as they did in the chef’s home growing up. The story about the slaves is presented not as a provocation, but as a somber fact among many other, less grave ones — about the local shrimp draped in tamarind sauce, or how jollof rice is a precursor to jambalaya.
By framing his cooking in historical, often memoiristic terms, Mbaye joins a cadre of Black chefs across the country — among them Mashama Bailey in Savannah, Georgia, Gregory Gourdet, in Portland, Oregon, and Kwame Onwuachi, in New York — rethinking popular narratives about the origins of American cuisine.
“I just want people to recognize our food the same way they do other food,” Mbaye said. “I want people to leave feeling inspired.”
Zella Palmer, the food scholar, has little doubt that many of Dakar’s diners are shedding tears of joy.
“Serigne is 29 years old, and he just opened up this amazing Senegalese restaurant on Magazine Street,” she said. “The ancestors are dancing.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — They called the party “Homecoming,” and for a certain kind of guest — most at home in VIP areas at fizzy nightspots — it was exactly that.
On the Friday night of Super Bowl LVII weekend, The h.wood Group, a Los Angeles hospitality company popular with celebrities, transformed a hangar at a private airport in Scottsdale into an elite Hollywood club.
It had all of the touches — an invite-only guest list, six-figure tables, famous people in the bathroom line, tasteful “brand activations” and the masses who weren’t on the list pleading for hours to get in — that would make veterans of the Hollywood party circuit feel right at home as they touched down into Arizona for the game.
The weekend is about football, kind of, and the halftime show and the ads, of course. But it has also become one of those tentpole festivals of vodka, contractual obligations and directed schmoozing, where the professional partyers of America do their job, which is to party.
And in the age of Instagram tags and co-brandings, an event such as this one is not just profitable on its own terms but is effectively a Super Bowl ad in its own right.
Other events of this class for the weekend included a Michelob Ultra and Netflix party, co-hosted by, among others, Serena Williams and Brian Cox. (Asked what his “Succession” character, Logan Roy, would say about such a branding exercise, Cox smiled and said, gnomically, “It does what does you good.”) There were also the long-running, no-media, invite-only party hosted by sportswear retailer Fanatics, with a guest list that included Jay-Z and Tiffany Haddish, and the mostly whispered about Commissioners Party, largely reserved for the league’s power elite.
At Homecoming, the crowd overflowed with the kind of celebrities who don’t exactly mind being seen.
Cher and producer Alexander Edwards, whom she is reportedly dating, took a seat near the stage. Alex Rodriguez and Jaleel White (yes, that’s Steve Urkel) hung out in an upstairs VIP area. Rapper Machine Gun Kelly and actress Megan Fox retreated to a booth, as did rapper Meek Mill. Keegan-Michael Key (one half of Key and Peele) obliged fan after fan with a selfie. Brittany Mahomes, wife of Kansas City’s starting quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, danced nearby. NFL stars — Derrick Henry, whose forearms are the size of steel bollards — and former ones — Johnny Manziel, once the sport-conquering “Mr. Football” but famous now mostly for his partying — stood shoulder-to-shoulder with excited engineers from Cash App, the payments company co-sponsoring the event.
Although the collection of the rich and famous at Homecoming was impressive, it could not claim the biggest name of the evening, Apple CEO Tim Cook, who showed up at a party thrown by GQ and Gucci on the other side of town.
“We wanted a big box to create our own world,” said John Terzian, co-founder of The h.wood Group, who counts Drake, Katy Perry and music executive Scooter Braun as friends. (Drake, who was the headlining musical act for the evening, shouted out one of Terzian’s restaurants, Delilah, in a 2019 song.)
Homecoming was a world filled with private tables, bars, more bars and neon. Guests could wander from the hanger out into several courtyards — one with Skee-Ball and Pop-A-Shot, and another with massage chairs and poker tables, giving the sense of a bar mitzvah for the 45-year-old who has everything.
Terzian’s original idea for the party had been for The h.wood Group clients (a term of art reserved for people who spend a lot of money at The h.wood Group clubs and restaurants) to fly their private jets — many of them from LA, of course — directly into the hanger, disembark and then party. That idea turned out to be logistically complicated, Terzian said. Still, he has come a long way since the early 2000s when he was a walk-on for USC’s football team, honing his skills throwing massive frat parties.
The room had its share of well-preserved white men with pushed-back white hair and Italian blazers. But the crowd was dominated by under-40s, who wore skintight dresses or hoodies by Aimé Leon Dore, Jacquemus and Rhude.
There were exceptions. Jeff Hamilton, founder of Guess Jeans and designer of sports-championship jackets for the likes of Michael Jordan and Shaquille O’Neal, wore a glossy leather bomber and a black turtleneck and flashed a set of blinding white teeth. He was there with Hughie Johnston, a former boxing champion who is now a conservative influencer and representative, he said, of British boxing champion Tyson Fury. Johnston and Hamilton were busy comparing Johnston’s business card, made up to look like an American Express Black card, to Hamilton’s actual black card.
“It’s very good,” Hamilton acknowledged. He was excited to see Drake, who wore one of Hamilton’s jackets at a recent show at the Apollo Theater in New York City.
A Brooklyn businessman, James Morrissey, posed with his wife, Aideen, in front of a neon-lit cactus. They had flown to the party because Morrissey owed some of his good luck in business — he launches liquors with celebrity partnerships — to The h.wood Group. Shortly before the 2019 Grammys, Morrissey was dining at the Nice Guy, The h.wood Group’s “Goodfellas”-themed restaurant in West Hollywood, when he was introduced to rapper Post Malone.
“Six days later, we were in a winery in France,” Morrissey said. And so, Malone’s rosé, Maison No. 9, was born.
There was a thin cloud trailing many of the guests, no matter how much Grey Goose they drank: work. It was perhaps most obvious among the influencers, who are technically always at work, and especially when they are out having fun.
In what was branded the Taco Bell Live Más area of the party, Tabitha Swatosh, a star on TikTok, was trying to figure out which photo of herself at Homecoming she should post to Instagram with a shoutout to Cash App, per the terms of her agreement with the payments company.
“It’s fun. No stress,” she said. “All my childhood dreams are coming true.”
Around 12:30 a.m., emissaries from Taco Bell spread out throughout the hanger, distributing the restaurant’s new “Big A** Mexican Pizza,” boxes of which flipped open to reveal damp discs of cheese and tomato.
“This is aggressive for a party where people are trying to look cute,” one guest said.
Soon the lights began to flicker, and the bass rose to flesh-quivering levels: signs that a Canadian Jewish rap superstar was soon to appear.
A few minutes after 1 a.m., Drake bounded up to the ring-shaped stage like a prizefighter, launching into an energetic medley of old hits, including “Started from the Bottom,” “Best I Ever Had” and “HYFR.”
As seemingly all of the 1,500 people inside the hangar raised their iPhones to tape the most famous man in the room, a three-deep crowd of hopefuls outside the front gate, spurred on by the music, redoubled their efforts to enter — mostly to no avail.
Earlier that evening, in the same place, a 23-year-old ticket reseller who called himself “Elo” prowled the crowd of hopefuls. He said he had scored four passes to the event by pretending to be comedian Chris Tucker’s agent. But now he was off to the next event — the Travis Scott show thrown by Rolling Stone at another venue in Scottsdale.
Finn McCarthy, 22, a college student who was in town to watch the Phoenix Open golf tournament, had heard about the party from a friend of a friend and had waited for two hours, “doing my thing,” before a bouncer gave him the bad news.
“Shut me down,” said McCarthy, who added that he was going home to get a few hours sleep before getting his partying started in earnest at the Phoenix Open the next day. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Redstone Family Drama: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On Sunday, May 13, 2018, Leslie Moonves, the chairman and chief executive of CBS, faced a difficult decision, perhaps the most agonizing of his long and celebrated media career: whether to pull the trigger on a coup against the Redstone family, which controlled CBS.
"This is NUCLEAR," Mr. Moonves wrote that afternoon to Bruce S. Gordon, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P. and a close confidant on the network's board.
The philandering and increasingly infirm 94-year-old Sumner Redstone, the patriarch who assembled CBS, the Paramount film studio and a bevy of cable networks under the Viacom umbrella into a multibillion-dollar media and entertainment empire, had let Mr. Moonves run CBS as he saw fit.
But now Shari Redstone, Mr. Redstone's daughter, was solidifying her hold. She had managed to separate her father from the growing influence of his two live-in companions, one purportedly his fiancée, with a nine-carat diamond to prove it. Ms. Redstone had recently stocked the Viacom board with her allies, who had then replaced the company's long-serving chief executive with her choice for the job -- something that Mr. Moonves feared would soon happen at CBS.
After Mr. Redstone divided his empire into two publicly traded but Redstone-controlled companies -- CBS and Viacom -- in 2006, Mr. Moonves had led CBS out of last place in the ratings and made it the most consistently watched broadcast network. But now Ms. Redstone wanted to merge the much healthier CBS with a floundering Viacom, and was consulting with Mr. Moonves -- meddling, in his view -- on a regular basis.
As Mr. Moonves had implored one board director: "Help me here. Shari is driving me crazy."
He showed no sign of this to Ms. Redstone, with whom he continued to discuss the merger. But while she thought he was open to her ideas, Mr. Moonves and his supporters on the CBS board had secretly plotted a board vote to strip the Redstones of their voting control and block the merger. Then CBS would immediately sue in Delaware to prevent Ms. Redstone, her father and the family trust that controlled their assets from replacing CBS board members or otherwise nullifying the board's action. This was the "nuclear" option -- a legal gambit with profound implications for every public company with a controlling shareholder, which includes many of the biggest media and tech companies.
"After filing there can't be a deal," Mr. Moonves continued in his message to Mr. Gordon. Referring to Ms. Redstone: "She won't be manageable."
"She's not manageable now," Mr. Gordon responded.
Today Shari Redstone ranks among the most powerful executives in Hollywood. As nonexecutive chair she oversees Paramount Global, the company that emerged from the combination of CBS and Viacom, home to such hits as last summer's "Top Gun: Maverick" and the current streaming series "Yellowstone."
Mr. Moonves, by contrast, was fired from CBS after more than a dozen women, including his own doctor, accused him of sexual misconduct; was denied $ 120 million in severance payments; and retreated in disgrace to his homes in Beverly Hills and Malibu, Calif. Initially a reluctant participant in her father's business empire, intimidated by the big names attending the annual media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, Ms. Redstone not only survived the "nuclear" option but emerged on top.
A trove of documents and testimony helps explain how she did it -- in part through her own "mettle," as her father might have put it, and in part thanks to some startling revelations that Mr. Moonves did his best to conceal from a board of directors who showed little interest in thoroughly investigating his past.
This account is drawn from our forthcoming book, "Unscripted: The Epic Battle for a Media Empire and the Redstone Family Legacy," and based on scores of interviews with participants conducted over three years. Many were on a not-for-attribution basis because of litigation and nondisclosure agreements. We reviewed numerous texts and emails exchanged among Mr. Moonves, CBS executives and board members, including those quoted above.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Moonves declined to comment. Ms. Redstone responded to questions either directly or through a spokesperson, and participated in fact-checking.
'Does not have the requisite business judgment'
That Ms. Redstone would ever be in a position to challenge Mr. Moonves -- or any of her father's other handpicked male executives -- once seemed unfathomable to anyone who knew the family's dynamic. The irascible Mr. Redstone had belittled and marginalized his daughter (and had driven his son, Brent, to abandon the business and family entirely and retreat to a Colorado ranch).
Mr. Redstone had long disparaged his daughter to Viacom executives, board members -- practically anyone who would listen. He pelted her with profanity-laced emails and faxes, according to several former Viacom executives who were copied on the missives. When his longtime lawyer and confidant, George Abrams, among those who saw the messages, begged Mr. Redstone not to use such hurtful language, he erupted, insisting he'd call his daughter whatever he pleased.
By 2007, father and daughter were barely speaking, communicating through faxes and lawyers. Fissures within the family were so widely known within CBS that employees would joke that the Redstones gave each other subpoenas for Christmas.
In a letter to trustees of his family trust that year, Mr. Redstone stated bluntly that "Ms. Redstone does not have the requisite business judgment and abilities to serve as chairman."
He took his disparaging views public in a letter to Forbes that July: "While my daughter talks of good governance, she apparently ignores the cardinal rule of good governance that the boards of the two public companies, Viacom and CBS, should select my successor."
'If there are any stories out there, we need to know'
When he was healthy, Mr. Redstone seemed certain that his daughter should not succeed him. That all appeared to change as his health, ability to speak and mental capacity deteriorated, especially after he ejected his romantic companions from his Beverly Hills mansion.
Over time, he increasingly depended on his daughter for his care and to interpret his wishes. Ms. Redstone emerged as his heir apparent, a powerful executive in her own right and the de facto chairman of her father's companies. This was the situation deemed intolerable by Mr. Moonves and his allies.
As the CBS board contemplated the "nuclear" option in early 2018, Mr. Moonves was well aware that far more was at stake than just the Redstone family's corporate control.
After articles in The New York Times and The New Yorker about Harvey Weinstein's serial abuse of women ushered in the #MeToo era, which encouraged sexual assault victims to speak publicly, rumors began circulating that Mr. Moonves would soon be another major media executive to be felled by accusations of misconduct. Ms. Redstone heard those rumors, too.
"There is a lot of noise here at CES," she emailed another board member, referring to the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2018.
According to another widespread rumor, Ronan Farrow, who had written the Weinstein exposé for The New Yorker, was at work on an article about Mr. Moonves.
Not all CBS directors were eager to get to the bottom of the rumors, but after Ms. Redstone's prodding, they hired Michael Aiello, a partner at Weil Gotshal & Manges, to interview Mr. Moonves about any potential accusations that could become public. Little did Ms. Redstone realize that her own future would turn on revelations about Mr. Moonves's past sexual misconduct.
"If there are any stories out there, we need to know," Mr. Aiello began a call with Mr. Moonves on Jan. 16, 2018, according to a lawyer's notes of the interview that were reviewed by The Times.
Mr. Moonves said there were two instances of possible concern, both decades in the past, long before his employment by CBS.
In the first, a young actress had come in for a meeting when he was at Warner Bros. He didn't know her. He said that he had exposed himself and that she "ran out of room," according to the notes.
"Let me take a step back," Mr. Aiello said. "What does 'exposed' mean?"
This time, Mr. Moonves said they had engaged in consensual oral sex. Afterward, he heard from her manager that the actress was "upset." The manager said that he had gotten calls from The Times, and that there was "buzz" about what had happened.
The second incident, Mr. Moonves said, involved a female television executive who had recently filed a police complaint against him for sexual assault. But the incident dated to the 1980s, and the statute of limitations had expired long ago, which would prevent any charges. In any event, he said, the sex was consensual.
That was pretty much the end of the investigation. No one asked Mr. Moonves the names of the women, let alone tried to hear their accounts.
Mr. Aiello assured the board that while there had been times when Mr. Moonves might have been "clumsy" and made "unwanted advances," there was nothing to worry about. Asked by one director for details about any incidents, Mr. Aiello seemed squeamish. He said that the board "didn't want to know" and that he "didn't want to go there."
Mr. Aiello declined comment for the book and didn't respond to requests for comment on this article.
Later that month, Ms. Redstone had lunch alone with Mr. Moonves at his office in Los Angeles. She laid out her long-term plans -- CBS and Viacom would merge and then be in a stronger position to compete or be acquired by another company. As she had said before, she didn't want to be a media mogul -- she was looking forward to focusing on her family and her other ventures. Was Mr. Moonves on board?
He said he was.
Mr. Moonves, she said, was essential to the plan. There was also the delicate issue of the #MeToo rumors. Ms. Redstone asked Mr. Moonves if there was any truth to them.
He told her to look him in the eyes. He assured her there was nothing to be concerned about.
'A public war for 6 months'
In May, as the "nuclear" option loomed, Mr. Moonves was clearly worried about Ms. Redstone's concerns. Even if he thought he had done nothing wrong, sexual abuse accusations alone -- should they ever become public -- were potentially ruinous to him and fatal to any lawsuit against the Redstones.
Mr. Moonves anguished over the decision, even trying to back out of the carefully orchestrated attack. In a series of texts produced in the Delaware litigation, he wrote to CBS's head of communications, his close ally Gil Schwartz, on May 13:
"I can't do this. I do not want to file. It will be a public war for 6 months. I am not emotionally prepared for this. I would rather leave. Sorry."
It fell to Bruce Gordon, the board confidant, to coax Mr. Moonves back. Mr. Gordon wasn't entirely surprised that Mr. Moonves was wavering. But he was convinced that a merger was not in the interest of CBS shareholders and had to be stopped.
The CBS board convened by phone that day to consider the attack on the Redstone family. With the meeting in progress, Mr. Gordon texted with Mr. Moonves, alternately sympathizing and cajoling: "I really don't think you want to do this. You are destroying your credibility."
"I am not ready for the fight," Mr. Moonves replied. "I can't do it. 6 months of attacks. No."
Mr. Moonves agonized that if he supported the board vote to dilute the Redstones' voting power and to file the ensuing lawsuit, Ms. Redstone would attack him with all the ammunition she could muster. If he didn't, he'd lose the support of the board members still loyal to him.
"I am sick either way," Mr. Moonves added. "I have never felt worse." He continued, "A public spectacle." Ms. Redstone "wants to run it. Let's let her."
Minutes later, Mr. Gordon texted Mr. Moonves that it was time for him to join the board call.
"I think we will add you on momentarily. You ready?"
Somehow Mr. Gordon had talked him back from the brink. Mr. Moonves had done another about-face and was ready to go ahead.
"Less is more," Mr. Gordon advised him. "Leave us the flexibility to work details this week."
Mr. Moonves joined the board call in progress just after 3 p.m. In minutes of the meeting reviewed by The Times, he said the board members had his full support in its decision to block the merger and sue the Redstones.
The board members on the call essentially had to choose between Ms. Redstone and Mr. Moonves and believed Mr. Moonves to be essential to the health of the enterprise. It voted unanimously that a merger with Viacom was not in the interest of CBS shareholders except for the Redstones.
The board members voted unanimously to go ahead with the plan.
After the vote, Mr. Gordon checked in with Mr. Moonves.
"You ok?" he texted.
"Yes," Mr. Moonves answered. It was only about 5:40 p.m., but he was already drinking. "On my third vodka and second egg roll. Go time."
As the evening went on, Mr. Moonves was still worrying about Ms. Redstone in texts to Joseph Ianniello, CBS's chief operating officer and a close ally. "She will come after me big time. I know you have my back!!! She threw us under the bus when not under pressure. Now??? Wow ... She will be enraged."
An hour and a half later, Mr. Moonves threw down the gauntlet.
"Mattresses tomorrow am," he texted Mr. Ianniello, in a reference to "The Godfather." "And take the gun. We need it."
The next morning, May 14, Ms. Redstone was at her apartment high in the tower of the Pierre Hotel in New York. Central Park sprawled outside her windows, its landscape a vivid green with spring foliage.
At 9:30 a.m. she received an email saying there would be a special CBS board meeting that Thursday. That was the first that Ms. Redstone had heard about any special board meeting.
She called one of her lawyers, Christopher Austin at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton in New York.
"What's this about a board meeting?"
"I'm afraid it's worse than that," Mr. Austin replied. "You've been sued. In Delaware."
"What?"
Mr. Austin outlined the claims: Ms. Redstone was plotting to replace the CBS directors. She had violated her duty to shareholders. Her fellow board members wanted to strip her, her father and her family of their control. As she saw it, they wanted to steal the company her father had built.
Ms. Redstone wandered through the apartment in a daze. She had just decided to drop the merger idea if Mr. Moonves didn't support it. For all their difficulties, she believed she and Mr. Moonves were friends.
At least that's what she had thought.
In Los Angeles it was just after 6:30 a.m., so Ms. Redstone texted Rob Klieger, her lawyer and fellow CBS director.
"I've been sued in Delaware. Call me. They've declared war."
'I am frankly ashamed'
CBS won Round 1 of the court battle, gaining a temporary restraining order preventing the Redstones from rewriting the bylaws or replacing the board members. But a new factor in the continued tenure of Mr. Moonves was looming outside the courtroom.
The rumor that Ronan Farrow was working on a Moonves article for The New Yorker turned out to be true. On July 27, the magazine published an exposé featuring the accounts of six women: "Les Moonves and CBS face allegations of sexual misconduct."
After reading the article, Ms. Redstone could barely contain her anger and frustration. All of it had come as a shock, notwithstanding the months of rumors.
She and Mr. Klieger were astonished that no one from the board or CBS had called them after the article came out. Yet the independent directors, those not aligned with Ms. Redstone and for the most part staunch supporters of Mr. Moonves, had gone ahead without consulting them and issued a public statement saying Mr. Moonves had the board's "full support."
Ms. Redstone fired off a letter to her fellow directors.
"I am frankly ashamed to sit on a board with independent directors who have demonstrated such blind allegiance to senior management and repeatedly failed to act in the best interests of the company, its employees and its shareholders," the letter began. (The letter was reviewed by The Times.)
She was especially critical of the board's previous investigation of the rumors about Mr. Moonves. Mr. Aiello's interview had seemed, to her, perfunctory at best. How could the board have expressed its support for Mr. Moonves when it had done almost nothing to investigate?
"While rumors and allegations are not fact, they do require board action, particularly given the intensity with which they were circulating," she wrote. "The board does not discharge its obligations by asking the C.E.O. if he engaged in any misconduct and taking his word for it when he says he did not."
She added that she had nothing to do with the New Yorker's investigation: "I have never spoken to Ronan Farrow, nor have I spoken with any of the women who have leveled accusations against Les."
'We all did that'
The board convened by phone on Monday morning, July 30, in executive session, which meant Mr. Moonves was excluded. Mr. Klieger and Ms. Redstone participated from offices at Cleary Gottlieb.
By then, sexual misconduct allegations had led to the firing of media celebrities like Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose. CBS itself, like many companies, had issued public statements that such conduct wouldn't be tolerated. Despite this, a cadre of CBS directors had no interest in discussion and had already made up their minds to support Mr. Moonves, according to the accounts of several directors who were at the meeting.
Arnold Kopelson, who won a best-picture Academy Award for producing "Platoon," was especially ardent in his support for Mr. Moonves, dismissing the New Yorker incidents as ancient history. He kept repeating that it was pilot season, when CBS most needed Mr. Moonves's golden touch.
At another point, according to those in the room, he insisted, "We all did that," referring to the allegations against Mr. Moonves. Mr. Kopelson subsequently emailed all his fellow directors: "I don't care if a hundred women come forward. Les is our leader and we have to stand behind him." (Other directors confirmed these remarks; Mr. Kopelson died not long after these events. The Times reviewed a copy of his email to the directors.)
There was also considerable talk about the likely negative reaction on Wall Street if Mr. Moonves was suspended, given that he was closely linked with CBS's success.
The directors didn't have to stay until midnight to resolve their differences. They seemed only too happy to embrace a suggestion from Mr. Klieger, the Redstone lawyer and board member, to wait until they heard from the outside lawyers hired for an independent investigation -- anything to delay removing Mr. Moonves. The meeting adjourned in less than an hour.
Amid intense speculation about Mr. Moonves's fate, CBS issued a statement saying that the board was "in the process of selecting outside counsel to conduct an independent investigation" and that "no other action was taken on this matter at today's board meeting."
Few were satisfied, either on Wall Street or beyond.
But unlike Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer or Charlie Rose, Mr. Moonves had survived.
'Naïveté about what he needs to disclose'
In the wake of the New Yorker article, CBS directors had finally agreed that the company needed an independent investigation. But even then, the warring factions couldn't agree on a firm. So they compromised by hiring lawyers from two different firms -- Mary Jo White, a former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, and Nancy Kestenbaum, a former federal prosecutor and a partner at Covington & Burling.
Their investigation focused less on the instances uncovered by The New Yorker and more on the two that Mr. Moonves disclosed when Mr. Aiello interviewed him the previous year: the actress, Bobbie Phillips, and the television executive, Phyllis Golden-Gottlieb.
Only now did the lawyers learn that more than 20 years after the alleged incident, the actress's manager, Marv Dauer, had been pressuring Mr. Moonves for months to cast Ms. Phillips, and that Mr. Moonves had approached CBS's casting head about the matter. Ms. Phillips had even been offered a part without having to audition or submit a tape.
This revelation came as a bombshell to the lawyers. A 30-year-old allegation of a sexual assault was one thing. But the casting conversation had just happened. It suggested that Mr. Moonves had wanted to cover up the incident, using company resources to silence a potential threat. And he hadn't told them about it.
Ms. White and Ms. Kestenbaum briefed members of the board. They gave an account of an interview they had with Mr. Moonves the previous day, touching on the police report, the actress and the incidents reported in The New Yorker, according to notes of the meeting reviewed by The Times. Ms. Kestenbaum summed up Mr. Moonves's response: "There were times when he would feel an attraction, think it was mutual, make an overture, and if he got rebuffed, he would leave it alone."
Ms. White continued, "Our sense is that whatever occurred, you don't see that after he gets married. Appears to have a 14-year period without this activity. We asked him what else might be out there. He said there was a time when I was dating, there could be something there, but all consensual. He mentioned an encounter with a female doctor, which was rebuffed. Wouldn't give the name or any details."
Then Ms. Kestenbaum mentioned the revelations about the actress and her manager. Mr. Moonves's lawyer "described this scenario as a shakedown," Ms. White said, according to the notes.
"In our view, this raises serious concerns both with respect to candor and forthrightness and the fact that Les took steps with human resources of CBS," Ms. Kestenbaum added.
Ms. White said the "other risk is what I would call naïveté about what he needs to disclose and what is risk," adding, "No one heard about the actress and getting her a job."
She seemed especially concerned that while Mr. Moonves recognized the personal risk -- "his stomach is churning" -- he didn't recognize the larger risk to the company that needed to be disclosed.
Ms. Kestenbaum continued: "In light of recent events, with the casting director, we are recommending that there be a change in status. We now think there is something new. Troubling."
"This is a deal breaker," she concluded.
'And now the end is here'
This was effectively the end of Mr. Moonves's career at CBS. He was fired on Sept. 9, 2018. With him gone, the "nuclear option" lawsuit collapsed just days later, when both sides agreed to dismiss the case. CBS and Viacom merged in 2019, and were renamed Paramount Global.
Ms. Redstone had finally prevailed. But the empire she now controlled was beset by new competitive threats and upheavals in the media landscape.
There's no question that combining CBS and Viacom allowed the company to gain greater scale. But Wall Street analysts were skeptical. And by the measure that Sumner Redstone cared most about -- the stock price -- the merger has failed to stem the company's decline. The combined market capitalization of Viacom and CBS was $ 30 billion when the merger was announced in 2019. Paramount Global's valuation is about half that. It was up against competitors that were many times larger: Amazon (market capitalization of over $ 1 trillion), Netflix (about $ 160 billion) and Walt Disney (about $ 200 billion).
While its competitors seized the opportunities presented by the digital revolution, Viacom and CBS lost precious years to their internal struggles. It's safe to say the intracompany warfare before 2018 delivered the worst possible outcome -- neither a merger of CBS and Viacom nor a sale to someone else.
It's not clear to what extent Mr. Redstone understood or was able to savor his daughter's win. Peter Bart, who was a longtime editor of Variety and close to Mr. Redstone, was granted a rare visit in 2019.
"His withered hand signaled a greeting, or the semblance of one," Mr. Bart reported in a column for Deadline Hollywood. "His eyes flickered weakly, but his effort at conversation was reduced to a grunt, mixed with an occasional scream of rage and frustration over his limitations." Mr. Redstone was bedridden, being fed intravenously, and "a team of nurses and conservators stand by for needed assistance," Mr. Bart observed.
On the morning of Aug. 11, 2020, Mr. Redstone's nurse called Ms. Redstone to tell her she thought the end was near.
Ms. Redstone told the nurse to put warmers on her father's hands and to hold him. She kept the phone line open so her father could hear her talk.
Over the next several hours, she reviewed his life's accomplishments. She promised to take care of the family and to nurture the business empire he had created. "It will be here forever," she assured him. "I love you," she said over and over.
Finally the nurse told her that Mr. Redstone had quietly stopped breathing.
He was 97. National Amusements, the family's holding company, announced his death, describing him as "the self-made businessman, philanthropist and World War II veteran who built one of the largest collections of media assets in the world."
Despite the father and daughter's late-in-life reconciliation, Ms. Redstone could never be certain she had gained her father's love or approval given his impaired faculties.
Just after Mr. Redstone died, Ms. Redstone reached out to Tad Jankowski, her father's friend and longtime business colleague, for reassurance. Had she done the right thing? she wondered, citing the changes on the Viacom board and the firing of Mr. Moonves. Would her father have approved? Had he really loved her?
What could he say? Mr. Jankowski emphasized that Mr. Redstone had loved a fight and loved to win. Ms. Redstone had never given up. He would be proud of her.
Mr. Redstone's remains were flown to his hometown, Boston. Ms. Redstone and two of her children accompanied the hearse to the family plot at Sharon Memorial Park. Because of the pandemic, no one else was present except for Ms. Redstone's ex-husband, a rabbi, who conducted the burial ceremony.
The gathering was so intimate that Ms. Redstone felt no need to restrain her emotions. She knelt so close to the grave her children worried she might fall in. Between bouts of crying, she told her father everything she had ever wanted to say to him.
Finally she stopped. "Is there anything else?" she asked.
Her daughter reminded her that Mr. Redstone had asked that Frank Sinatra's recording of "My Way" be played at his funeral. Ms. Redstone had always cringed on the many occasions her father insisted on listening to it. But now she asked her daughter to pull up the lyrics on her phone. Ms. Redstone began singing:
And now the end is here
And so I face that final curtain
She struggled through the five verses, each ending with the refrain:
"I did it my way."

Disney Cuts $5.5 Billion In Reshuffle: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the company's first earnings report since Bob Iger returned as C.E.O., it exceeded Wall Street's expectations. But about 7,000 jobs are expected to be cut.
Robert A. Iger gave Disney's corporate critics the equivalent of a punch in the mouth on Wednesday.
In his first earnings report since he came out of retirement to retake the reins of a troubled Disney, Mr. Iger unveiled a new operating structure for the company -- one designed to galvanize its film and television studios while drastically cutting costs. As part of the restructuring, Disney expects to cut costs by $ 5.5 billion and eliminate roughly 7,000 jobs, or about 4 percent of its global total.
"We must return creativity to the center of the company, increase accountability, improve results and ensure the quality of our content and experiences," Mr. Iger said on an earnings-related conference call with analysts.
Content production and distribution, including streaming, will be housed in a single division (instead of two, which were sometimes at odds), with the exception of sports. To that end, ESPN and its streaming offshoot will become a stand-alone unit for the first time, a move that was instantly interpreted as making the sports behemoth easier to spin off or sell, should Disney decide to pursue such action.
"We did not do it for that purpose," Mr. Iger said. "ESPN continues to create real value for us. We just have to figure out how to monetize it in a disrupting world."
The organizational changes, which will go into effect immediately, were designed with astonishing speed; Mr. Iger returned to the company only in late November.
Mr. Iger also disclosed quarterly profit and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Losses in Disney's streaming division abated by $ 400 million compared with the previous quarter; investors had been braced for half as much. Despite a weakening economy, Disney's domestic theme parks delivered a fat $ 2.1 billion in operating profit, an increase of 36 percent from a year earlier.
In late November, the Disney board fired Bob Chapek as chief executive and reinstated Mr. Iger, who ran the company from late 2005 to early 2020. The leadership change was made, in part, in response to threats from activist investors like Nelson Peltz, who is fighting for a board seat for himself or his son. Mr. Peltz has attacked Disney as "a company in crisis," with challenges that are "primarily self-inflicted."
Mr. Peltz has said he needs a board seat to help Disney revamp its streaming business, refocus on profit growth, cut costs, reinstate its dividend (suspended during the early part of the coronavirus pandemic, when much of Disney was closed) and do a much better job at succession planning. Mr. Peltz's Trian Partners has amassed roughly $ 1 billion in Disney stock.
Mr. Iger said on Wednesday that Disney's board was on track to restore the dividend by the end of the year.
"We are pleased that Disney is listening," a representative for Mr. Peltz said in a statement.
Disney shares rose 5 percent in after-hours trading. After a sharp decline in 2022, the price has increased 26 percent this year.
Underscoring the importance of streaming to Disney's future, operating profit from traditional television (the ABC broadcast network and 15 cable channels, led by ESPN) totaled $ 1.3 billion in the quarter, a 16 percent decrease from a year earlier. Revenue fell 5 percent, to $ 7.3 billion. Disney attributed the declines to lower advertising revenue, reflecting a drop-off in viewership, especially overseas.
Disney's cable portfolio has held up better than those owned by some rival companies, but people have been cutting the cable cord at an alarming pace. Total hookups in the United States declined by a record 6.2 percent from October to December.
A decade ago, ESPN had more than 90 million subscribers. The number is now closer to 75 million. Disney has been able to maintain ESPN's profitability by raising prices. For every subscriber, ESPN collects a monthly fee of more than $ 8 from cable providers, by far the highest for any channel. But that era is ending: Analysts say revenue from subscriber fees will decline in 2023 for the first time.
Mr. Iger said ESPN hoped to renew its expiring contract with the National Basketball Association, but added that the channel would have to pare back on other sports rights to maintain profitability. "We're simply going to have to get more selective," he said.
After a period when they pushed companies like Disney to chase streaming subscribers at any cost, investors have shifted to a new mind-set: Show us the profits. Disney has repeatedly said its flagship Disney+ service will be profitable by October 2024 -- and did so again on Wednesday -- but Wall Street has been skeptical. Losses in Disney's streaming division totaled $ 1.1 billion in the quarter that ended in late December.
Disney had 234.7 million subscriptions across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ in the quarter, down from 235.7 million in early October. (Netflix has roughly 231 million subscribers worldwide after adding 7.7 million in the fourth quarter, well beyond its forecast of about 4.5 million.)
Disney+ lost about 2.4 million subscribers worldwide, for a new total of 161.8 million. All the decline came from a low-priced version of Disney+ in India. (Last year, Disney lost a bid to renew the expensive rights to Indian Premier League cricket matches.) Hulu, which does not operate overseas, recorded a 2 percent increase in subscribers. ESPN+ also added to its count by 2 percent.
"It's obvious to us that we can't get to profitability and turn this into a growth business without growing subs," Mr. Iger said of Disney+. But the company "might have gotten a bit too aggressive" in marketing the service around the world, he added.
Disney will also focus more intently on family and children's entertainment and pull back on generic general-audience programming. Mr. Iger said new "Toy Story," "Zootopia" and "Frozen" sequels were in the pipeline, for instance.
Disney's streaming division generated $ 5.3 billion in revenue, a 13 percent increase from a year earlier. On Dec. 8, Disney began charging $ 11 for a monthly subscription to the ad-free version of Disney+, up from $ 8, a 38 percent increase. The company also introduced an ad-supported option at $ 8.
In the restructuring, Mr. Iger gave oversight of streaming to a pair of lieutenants: Alan Bergman, previously Disney's top movie executive, and Dana Walden, the company's entertainment and news television chief. They will run a division called Disney Entertainment. Each will now be viewed outside the company as a potential successor to Mr. Iger, whose contract expires in December 2024.
Operating profit at Disney Parks, Experiences and Products totaled $ 3 billion, a 25 percent increase from a year earlier. Revenue in the parks and consumer products division climbed 21 percent, to $ 8.7 billion. The jump in profitability reflected growth in guest spending at Walt Disney World, in particular for line-shortening passes; better results at Disney Cruise Line; and higher returns from parks in France and Japan.
In total, Disney generated $ 23.5 billion in revenue in the quarter, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier. Analysts had expected slightly less. Excluding items affecting comparisons, per-share profit for the most recent quarter was 99 cents, a 7 percent decrease from a year earlier. Analysts had expected 79 cents.

For Best Actress, The Best Brouhaha: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: You've got questions about the surprise best-actress nominee, and our awards columnist has the answers (and a few more questions).
The seismic Will Smith slap? The jaw-dropping "La La Land"-"Moonlight" mix-up? You can have 'em. I like my Oscar controversies like I like my "Curb Your Enthusiasm" plot lines: small, petty and a little bit deranged.
That's why I've been gripped by all the new developments surrounding Andrea Riseborough, who managed a surprise best-actress nomination last month that quickly turned from boon to boondoggle. It's the story everyone in Hollywood is talking about, though you'd be forgiven for wondering what exactly has gone down or why any of it matters. With that in mind, let's see if I can find the answers to your questions:
Who is Andrea Riseborough?
The 41-year-old Brit is a real actor's actor, the sort of committed thespian who is well-respected by her peers but has mostly flown under the pop-cultural radar. Without even clocking that it was the same actress, you might have seen Riseborough playing Nicolas Cage's wife in the hallucinogenic "Mandy"; seducing Emma Stone in "Battle of the Sexes"; covering up an accidental death in an episode of "Black Mirror"; or exploring a ruined Earth with Tom Cruise in "Oblivion."
Because Riseborough has played such a wide variety of roles without developing a tangible star persona, she is often described as a "chameleon" or even "unrecognizable," which is Hollywood-speak for an actress who doesn't wear eye makeup. Still, the woman is damn castable: She appeared in four movies last year alone, including "To Leslie," the tiny indie at the heart of this Oscar controversy.
What is "To Leslie"?
Directed by Michael Morris, "To Leslie" stars Riseborough as the title character, a hard-drinking West Texan who won the lottery years ago but has blown through her money and torpedoed her relationships in the time since. As her frustrated family and friends wonder what to do with the belligerent Leslie, big questions are bandied about: Is it better to let an addict hit rock bottom or to extend a helping hand? Does there ever come a time when severing family ties should be done for your own good? And hey, is that Stephen Root, the stapler nerd from "Office Space," playing a leather-daddy biker? (Alongside a glowering Allison Janney, no less!)
The film debuted at South by Southwest last March alongside a much more high-profile Oscar contender, "Everything Everywhere All at Once," and though "To Leslie" received mostly positive reviews, it earned less than $ 30,000 during its October release. In a year when many specialty films struggled to find an audience in theaters, that box office total was still so low that Riseborough's co-star, the podcaster Marc Maron, accused the "To Leslie" distributor, Momentum Pictures, of "gross incompetence" on Twitter, then blasted the studio for failing to submit the film for awards consideration by most industry guilds. That sort of negligence might make people want to take matters into their own hands ... but we'll get to that.
How is Riseborough's performance?
Though Leslie is a scrappy slip of a person, Riseborough makes a lot of big choices while playing her. It's a pugnacious, eccentric performance, and though I'm an on-the-record fan of maximalist acting, I should let you know that if this were measured on a scale of 1 (utter naturalism) to 10 (Kristen Wiig as Liza Minnelli trying to turn off a lamp), Riseborough would be pulling an awfully high number.
In other words, it's the sort of big, actressy transformation that awards voters flock to like catnip, and if someone like Charlize Theron or Michelle Williams had de-glammed to play Leslie, there likely would have been Oscar buzz from the beginning. But without box office success or a big name, Riseborough appeared to be a non-starter.
What was unusual about her Oscar campaign?
A typical Oscar race plays out like a couture-clad season of "Squid Game," where a large number of hopefuls are winnowed down to a surviving few. To stay in the conversation until the very end, it helps to win critics awards and earn nominations at televised awards shows, and Riseborough lagged on both counts: She hadn't mustered much more than an Independent Spirit Award nomination and had no deep-pocketed distributor ready to buy For Your Consideration ads on her behalf. By most pundits' estimation, she was not a serious contender, nor even an on-the-bubble dark horse.
But during the second week of January, just days before voting for the Oscar nominations began, a cadre of movie stars suddenly took to social media on Riseborough's behalf. Edward Norton was the first big booster, telling his two million Twitter followers that Riseborough gave "the most fully committed, emotionally deep ... physically harrowing performance I've seen in a while." The next day, Gwyneth Paltrow announced on Instagram that "Andrea should win every award there is and all the ones that haven't been invented yet."
As the week wore on, at least two dozen more celebrities climbed aboard the Riseborough Railroad -- from A-listers like Amy Adams, Kate Winslet and Jennifer Aniston to random stowaways like Jenny McCarthy and Tan France -- and award watchers started to wonder what the hell was going on. The answer that emerged is that a late-breaking campaign had been waged by Riseborough's manager, Jason Weinberg, and the actress Mary McCormack, who is married to Morris, the "To Leslie" director, to get the film in front of as many of their famous industry friends as possible.
"The movie cannot afford any FYC ads, so this letter and invitation will have to do instead!" McCormack wrote in one of her mass emails, which were published by Vanity Fair. In a later missive, she said movies like "To Leslie" were an endangered species in need of support, writing, "I worry that unless we all support small independent filmmaking, it'll just get eaten up by Marvel movies and go away forever."
With those entreaties, McCormack, Weinberg and Riseborough assembled a starry battalion of boosters that eventually included even her best actress competitor Cate Blanchett, who gave Riseborough a shout-out during her televised acceptance speech at the Critics Choice Awards. (This begs the question: Would Lydia Tár have been Team Riseborough? I don't think the fictional conductor could ever bring herself to endorse a movie about West Texas -- they eat too much barbecue there -- though I could imagine a scene where she receives McCormack's mass email, grimaces and then orders an underling to delete it.)
Why were people so upset?
This was hardly the first time that a contender had taken Oscar promotion into her own hands: Who can forget Melissa Leo's iconic "Consider" ad campaign, in which the eventual Oscar winner donned furs and posed among pillars like a Blackglama model prowling Hearst Castle? But Riseborough's team bypassed the FYC-ad industrial complex entirely, opting to wage a weeklong war powered mostly by word of mouth instead of an expensive, multi-month campaign that would have involved round tables, parties, red-carpet appearances, film-festival tributes and endless press hits.
It was an unprecedented awards-season gambit, and it worked: When the presenter Riz Ahmed read Riseborough's name out loud during the Jan. 24 announcement of the Oscar nominations, the journalists in attendance gasped, giggled and oohed like a scandalized sitcom audience. They knew that Riseborough had just pulled off something crazy, and it didn't take long before rival awards strategists began working the phones, suggesting that her grass-roots campaign may have run afoul of Oscar rules.
And as the Riseborough surge sunk in, her surprise nomination was weighed against the snubs of the "Woman King" star Viola Davis and the "Till" lead Danielle Deadwyler: If those two Black actresses had been nominated alongside the "Everything Everywhere All at Once" star Michelle Yeoh, as many pundits were expecting, it would have been the first time in Oscar history that the best actress race featured a majority of women of color.
In an essay for The Hollywood Reporter published Tuesday, the "Woman King" director, Gina Prince-Bythewood, did not mention Riseborough by name but alluded to the "social capital" that had helped propel her to a nomination. "Black women in this industry, we don't have that power," Prince-Bythewood wrote. "There is no groundswell from privileged people with enormous social capital to get behind Black women. There never has been."
Did the campaign break any rules?
In a statement released on Jan. 27, the academy announced it would review the campaign procedures of the year's nominees to make sure none of its guidelines were violated. Though Riseborough and "To Leslie" weren't mentioned specifically, a reference to grass-roots campaigns in the statement all but confirmed that her nomination was the subject of investigation.
Which aspects of the campaign might have earned scrutiny? Online sleuths noticed that a slew of copy-paste phrases -- including the description of "To Leslie" as "a small film with a giant heart" -- had appeared in social-media posts from the unlikely likes of Mia Farrow, Meredith Vieira and Joe Mantegna. And there was an eyebrow-raising Instagram post from the actress Frances Fisher, soon to be seen tightening Kate Winslet's corset in the "Titanic" rerelease, who encouraged voters to select Riseborough because "Viola, Michelle, Danielle & Cate are a lock," though it's generally forbidden to mention specific competitors in that way.
As the controversy began to heat up, wild rumors flew that Riseborough's nomination could be rescinded. Puck News even wondered, "Was the Andrea Riseborough Oscar Campaign Illegal?" -- a headline so breathless that you'd half-expect someone like Paltrow to be hauled before The Hague as an accomplice. (Hey, if you can't lock someone up for selling jade vagina eggs, maybe they could be arrested for the lesser charge of Oscar meddling. Isn't that how they got Al Capone?)
Have Oscar nominations ever been rescinded before?
Rarely, but the last two times it happened, the cause was improper campaigning. In 2014, the academy rescinded Bruce Broughton's extremely "huh?" original-song nomination from the obscure faith-based film "Alone Yet Not Alone" because he'd leaned on his influence as a former academy governor when soliciting consideration. And in 2017, the academy yanked the nomination for the "13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi" sound mixer Greg P. Russell because he had engaged in "telephone lobbying."
It was tempting, then, to wonder if a Riseborough rebuke might change the entire makeup of the best actress race: After all, the Emmys rescinded Peter MacNicol's 2016 nomination for guest actor in a comedy after learning he had appeared in too many "Veep" episodes to qualify, and then his replacement, the "Girls" guest star Peter Scolari, actually went on to win in the category. But even if the academy had seen fit to give Riseborough the hook, there would be no one to take her place. According to the academy's bylaws, the race would simply be reduced to the remaining four nominees.
So what happens now?
On the last day of January, the academy's chief executive, Bill Kramer, released another statement about the investigation, and though this statement did mention the "To Leslie" awards campaign by name, it concluded that Riseborough's nomination would not be rescinded. "However, we did discover social media and outreach campaigning tactics that caused concern," Kramer wrote. "These tactics are being addressed with the responsible parties directly."
It's unclear who those parties are: The academy didn't name names, Riseborough hasn't given an interview since the morning of the nominations, and Fisher's Instagram post was still up last time I checked. But even if the terms of the scolding are unclear, the far-reaching effects of Riseborough's curveball campaign have the potential to change the way we think of awards season.
For one, a new spotlight has been put on the academy's vaunted diversity efforts: Is it enough to simply recruit more members of color when so many of the voters remain obstinate, older white people who, for example, told Prince-Bythewood that they'd had no interest in seeing her movie? Of the four acting categories, the best-actress race has proved most hostile to recognizing people of color, and that won't change until voters recognize the biases they hold when determining whose stories matter.
But it also means that next season, just when we think the amount of viable Oscar contenders has shrunk to almost five, a surprise could come from nowhere that completely changes the race. Riseborough pioneered a risky new tactic that other would-be contenders could use to slingshot themselves back into viability. All they'll need is patience -- well, and an improbably starry Rolodex that hopefully has little overlap with Riseborough's. After all, if Winslet has already called Riseborough "the greatest female performance onscreen I have ever seen in my life," will we believe her when she says the same thing next year about M3gan?

BOSTON — With audiences showing a continued preference to stream movies in the comfort of home, away from crowds and overpriced snacks, the box office take for many films has suffered. But the new comedy “80 for Brady” tested the trend and succeeded. It brought in a higher-than-expected take of $12.5 million and nabbed the number two spot at the box office in its opening weekend, grossing just about $2 million less than the horror film “Knock at the Cabin.”
The movie, set in 2017, follows the misadventures of a group of older women who are such superfans of the New England Patriots, and its star quarterback at the time, Tom Brady, that they decide to take a road trip to see the team play in the Super Bowl in Houston. The stars — Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Rita Moreno and Sally Field — have an average age of 84, making the film a rare template: a road-tripping women’s empowerment movie for the senior set.
Based on the kernel of a true story about a group of female friends who watched Patriots games together weekly, it diverges from reality in nearly every way. The actual coterie never experienced the road trip, or the scams, flirtations, high-stakes poker game, choreographed dance maneuvers, wigs, spicy chicken wing-eating contests, consumption of high-potency weed edibles, and they never met Billy Porter, Guy Fieri, Retta and Patton Oswalt as our protagonists do in the film.
The fact that this AMC 19 theater was in central Boston, where Brady led the Patriots to a half-dozen Super Bowl wins, on the day after he announced his retirement from professional football, acted as encouragement, and the film being named after, featured and produced by Brady didn’t hurt either. (The studio said this announcement was purely coincidental.)
“I’m absolutely a Patriots fan and a Tom Brady fan,” said Dou Yu, 48, a biomedical researcher. “I was going to wait for this on streaming, but I thought since he retired yesterday, it’s kind of a unique moment.”
But it was the plot, and particularly the cast, that was the attraction for many audience members.
“It’s ladies of our age,” said Jane Pappalardo, 79, who attended the 6:15 p.m. showing with her longtime neighbor and friend, Rosalie R. Shane, 78. She gestured toward a life-size poster of the cast.
“I’ve seen every episode of ‘Grace and Frankie’ five or six times,” she said, referring to the popular Netflix series starring Fonda and Tomlin. “I don’t like to see superheroes and violence and shoot-em-ups and things that 20-year-olds want to see. This is for us.”
Shane agreed. “My husband is away for a week, so I’m getting to see my friends and we’re doing fun things. I said to Jane yesterday, ‘You want to get together and get a glass of wine?’ And she said, ‘How about going to see this movie, and then we’ll have a glass of wine.’”
They both laughed.
“It wasn’t exactly at the top of my list,” Shane said. “But, at the same time, I’m very curious. He’s just retired — hopefully for good — and I’ve always loved him. And it seems like it will be a silly, fun movie, and Brady will be in it, and everyone’s talking about Brady. So here I am.”
Her friend, Pappalardo, had a slight difference of opinion. “They could remove Tom Brady from this movie, and I wouldn’t care,” she said.
The women’s attendance fell into a general demographic trend, one that Paramount, which distributed the movie, felt certain it could capture in theaters: women age 35 and above.
“The reality is this picture was acquired for Paramount Plus,” said Chris Aronson, Paramount’s president of domestic distribution, speaking of the studio’s streaming service, which purchased the film from the independent studio Fifth Season.
“But when we saw it and we put it in front of an audience, we realized that we had something that was unique in the marketplace. And certainly, the primary audience was a very specific audience that we knew we could reach.”
“There’s an old line about, you don’t have to make a movie for everybody, but you’d better make it for somebody,” Aronson added.
In fact, according to Paramount’s research, the audience skewed just as predicted. Nearly 70% of attendees were women and nearly 75% were over 35. Fifty percent of attendees were 55 and up.
Moviegoers said they were drawn to the female-driven story.
Latasha Harris, 41, a special products coordinator, was seeking a means of decompressing after work. She finds the theater to be far more immersive as a locus for this kind of release than streaming something in her living room. “At home, you watch a movie, but you still see the mess you need to clean up,” she said.
But she chose the movie specifically for its cast and content. “I love the fact that there’s a movie portraying older women,” she said. “Representation is always important. As a Black woman, it’s awesome to see women, particularly Black women, but women of any kind, on the screen, to see their stories. And in a way that’s not completely centered around a man, and ‘how do I catch this man?’”
This sentiment was echoed by Charity Wangari, 26, a graduate student in aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Wangari had just signed up for AMC’s monthly membership program, and this was her second film in the last two weeks. The first was Sarah Polley’s “Women Talking ,” an intense tale of women in a religious sect escaping ritual sexual abuse by the group’s men.
“My goal, or at least I’m trying, is to watch shows and movies that feature women,” she said.
Doris Chin, 66, a retired supervisor from the Boston Public Library, who had seen preview screenings, was already a fan. She was seeing “80 for Brady” for the third time. “As much as I see it, more and more, I actually find it getting better,” Chin said. “I love the cast, especially Rita Moreno, at 91. She’s amazing.”
Chin is also a member of the AMC membership program, and goes to the movies three or four times a week. When asked if she might return for another screening of “80 for Brady,” she shrugged and smiled. “Maybe one more time.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Why Do Eggs Cost So Much?: [briefing]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Inflation, avian flu and war have made a food staple much more expensive.
Prices have risen for just about everything over the past couple of years. But anyone shopping for groceries recently has probably noticed the cost of one item in particular: eggs.
Buying eggs has become very expensive. In December 2022, the average price of a dozen eggs in the U.S. was $ 4.25, more than twice what they cost a year earlier:
A combination of factors is at work here. Some, like inflation, have a broader, more long-term impact on goods in general. Others, like the outbreaks of a highly contagious avian flu, are specific to eggs and poultry. Today's newsletter will explain how these causes contributed to record-high egg prices.
Inflation
Americans eat a lot of eggs. They consumed an average of 278 per person last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That amounts to an egg at breakfast most days.
Keeping the supply of these eggs flowing depends on the hens that lay them. Like so much else, feeding hens their typical diet of grains like corn, oats and barley now costs more for egg farmers. This chart shows grain prices in 2022 compared with previous years:
Russia and Ukraine are key suppliers of the world's wheat and grains, and the war in Ukraine greatly reduced their exports last year, restricting the global supply and thus driving up prices. In addition to paying more to feed their chickens, egg farmers have been confronting increased energy costs to run their farms and paying more for gas to transport their yields.
Still, inflation alone doesn't explain the sharp increase in the price of eggs that occurred toward the end of last year.
Avian flu
Another factor in egg prices is the supply of hens themselves. The population of egg-laying hens in the U.S. fell drastically when a highly contagious avian influenza broke out early last year and again in the fall. About 44 million egg-laying hens died as a result, or slightly more than one in 10 hens from the pre-outbreak population.
The virus, which is often fatal, killed many birds. Farmers slaughtered others that were exposed to stop the flu from spreading. It can take months after an outbreak for farmers' egg output to return to previous levels. In addition to clearing infected flocks, they have to clean the facilities, bring in new hens and wait for them to grow and lay eggs.
The highest demand for eggs usually comes at Easter, for egg hunts and decorating, and around the end-of-the-year holidays, when many people are baking, said Amy Smith, an agriculture business expert at Advanced Economic Solutions, a food industry consulting firm. So the timing of these outbreaks, shown in the chart below, was particularly noticeable to consumers.
Eight years ago, about 43 million egg-laying birds died as a result of avian flu. Egg prices rose sharply then, too (as you can see in the first chart), and peaked about three months after the outbreak ended. Last year, the industry had less time between outbreaks to restock their hens. As of December, the egg-laying population in the U.S. had yet to return to pre-outbreak levels.
Sticky egg demand
Even as the price of eggs has steadily risen in recent months, demand for them has mostly persisted. Experts say it would take still larger price increases to reduce demand by even a small amount. For now, even if only the most expensive cartons of eggs are all that's on the supermarket shelf, someone will probably still buy them.
Some people have sought alternatives, like plant-based substitutes. Others have tried to raise their own chickens. (Smith told me this wouldn't necessarily save money.) Border agents have even discovered more people trying to bring eggs in from Mexico.
For most consumers, there are no real substitutes. Smith summed it up: "Eggs are eggs. And people want eggs."

Gina Rodriguez Has a Playlist for When She Gives Birth: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actress spent her pregnancy making a new TV series, "Not Dead Yet," and watching "WandaVision."
In the ABC sitcom "Not Dead Yet," premiering Feb. 8, Nell Serrano is an obituary writer who, according to the subject of one of her assignments -- yes, she's visited by the dead -- envies other people's happiness.
Gina Rodriguez, who is expecting her first child, spoke with us last month, saying that she's in a different, happier place than Nell, whom she plays, but she knows things could change at any time. "I'm learning at every single turn," she said.
Previously the star of the CW television series "Jane the Virgin" and heard in the title role of the Netflix animated series "Carmen Sandiego," Rodriguez shared some of the music on her birth playlist, as well as other things that have been helping her get by, including "WandaVision" and "Be Here Now." These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
1. "WandaVision" I started watching the show during my pregnancy. At first I was like, what is this show? It's a take on "I Love Lucy"? And then I saw that it's all wrapped up in her grief. The power of human emotion and the unconscious decisions that we make when we're in these spaces of love and longing and grief are just wild and awesome. Its portrayal of a human journey through the possibility of action based on an unconscious emotion is really interesting to me.
2. Ram Dass My husband discovered Ram Dass and brought him into our relationship. I find the way he viewed the world and the journey he went on to be very helpful to me. We have, like, 14 copies of his book "Be Here Now," because it's our No. 1 present we give people. Every time I listen to the audiobook "Becoming Nobody," I learn something new, and I'm reminded that I fall right back into things, such as feeling like my identity is my everything and my ego gets attached to the identity.
3. Failure In my production company, we want to create a safe space for failure because it's only in failure that you learn. And if you don't get another chance after failure, it is such an unfortunate missed opportunity for growth. When you have a space where you can fail, you do better, you get stronger and you say, "OK, I'm not going to do it like this, I'm going to try it like this. Or that path didn't work, let's try this next path."
4. "The Dawn of Everything" I have always been interested in the history of humankind. It's so interesting that every time we personify people of the past, they're not as intelligent and not as civilized. I picked up David Graeber and David Wengrow's "The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity" on a Barnes & Noble shopping spree. It's riveting. It presents such an interesting perspective on the history of humanity, and it makes me think about everything just a little bit more.
5. Bidet When we remodeled our home, we had a combination toilet/bidet put in our primary bedroom. It is a game changer. When we go overseas and the bidet is a separate unit, I'm like, this is fabulous. It should be like this everywhere.
6. "My Brilliant Friend" After we shot "Annihilation," Natalie Portman gave me Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels series as a wrap gift. I have read each of them multiple times. Starting with "My Brilliant Friend," they are the most whisk-you-away, escape-into-another-person's-world books. I love them so much. It was the best wrap gift I've ever gotten. And I always think about Natalie when I read them.
7. Mumford & Sons I have a playlist of songs to listen to when I give birth. Several Mumford & Sons songs are on the playlist, including "Little Lion Man," "Awake My Soul" and "I Will Wait." They sing like they're connected to the center of the universe. It makes me feel a sense of closeness to my ancestors, even though it's not the kind of music my ancestors listened to. There's just a spirituality to their music. Whether they were writing that or not, that's what I respond to.
8. Bad Bunny My fellow Puerto Rican artist is definitely the music of my ancestors. I think he is super innovative. He's been able to introduce styles of music, such as merengue, that haven't been popular in the United States. Bad Bunny makes me feel every nostalgia under the sun of my childhood. And I just think he's super, super talented.
9. Oregon After we started visiting friends in Bend, we fell in love with Oregon, which is now our second home. We try and spend half the year there. It's such a beautiful state. There are so many different climates and things to see -- the mountains, the coast, the woods. I saw my first owl in Oregon. I grew up in Chicago and Puerto Rico. We weren't seeing owls.
10. Oahu Hawaii feels like home. It feels like Puerto Rico. There is a oneness of Mother Nature there that feels like the center of the forest, but it's beach, and it's jungle, and it's water and ocean. Oddly, you find a lot of people who vacation in Hawaii in Oregon, and vice versa. They feel like polar opposites, but they tend to draw people with the same kind of yearning for Mother Nature.

Full text: Will ChatGPT kill Google?
That's been the hot question in Silicon Valley since November, when the artificial intelligence company OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot so astoundingly human seeming that many saw it as a preview of how we'll all search for information one day. Sure, the speculation is jumping the gun. As I and lots of others have pointed out, ChatGPT is interesting but far from ready for prime time.
Still, talk of Google's demise is not unwarranted. The search engine turned 24 in September, which in tech qualifies as prehistoric, and I'm one of the many pundits who've complained about its waning utility in its near-monopolistic dotage.
But there's no need to wait for ChatGPT to find a better source of information than Google. For a large number of my most important internet searches these days -- when I'm looking to learn something, fix something, buy something or decide something -- there are two places I look most often, neither of them Google.
One of these places is Reddit, a site whose outsize role in my life I plan to write about in a future column.
The other is YouTube. The gargantuan video site is a lot of things to a lot of people -- in different ways, YouTube is a little bit like TikTok, a little like Twitch and a little like Netflix -- but I think we underappreciate how often YouTube is a better Google. That is, often it is the best place online to find reliable and substantive knowledge and information on a huge variety of subjects.
Much of the rest of this column is going to sound like falling-over praise for YouTube, so let me say at the jump that I understand its many problems. For one thing, "reliable," on the internet, is relative. YouTube has been rolling out policies against misinformation and extremism that are more stringent than they used to be, but like just about every other place online, it can be a font of lies and a haven for radicalism, and its engagement-hungry recommendation algorithm can gin up sensationalist controversy just as surely as Facebook or Fox News.
YouTube also wields enormous power over the ecosystem of online creators, and it offers no relief from monopoly. It is owned by Alphabet, also the parent company of Google, so battling Google's market power by switching to YouTube is like buying Doritos instead of Fritos to stick it to Frito-Lay.
All that said, there are many times YouTube is the internet's best source for answers to your queries.
The most obvious is when you're trying to learn some physical skill. If you want to make a soufflé, fix a clogged drain, learn guitar, improve your golf swing or do essentially anything that is best understood by watching someone else do it, there is almost no point searching anywhere other than YouTube.
I've written before about my hipsterish penchant for taking up old-timey pastimes like ceramics and sourdough. Hobbies like these tend to involve developing an intuition for the craft that can come only with practice -- but that practice, I've found, can be supercharged by watching other people do the thing many, many times. My pottery class took place once a week for just a few hours, not enough time with the clay to develop much of a feel for it. But in the week between classes I'd watch dozens of YouTube ceramists throwing pots, and each time I went to class I felt I'd absorbed some of their tricks. I'm certain I got much better much faster than I would have in the days before YouTube; actually, if I hadn't been able to see other people's progress online, I might have just quit.
It's not just hobbies and household skills that you can pick up on YouTube. If you want to understand something of any real complexity, I've found that a video on YouTube is often more informative than what's available elsewhere on the web. You may have read a few months ago about the physics breakthrough in which researchers created a tiny wormhole using a quantum computer. This 17-minute video by Quanta magazine got me closer to comprehending it than anything else.
It's not a substitute for real-life instruction, but as many parents learned during the pandemic, YouTube can be a tremendously helpful aid for students learning math, science, history and other subjects. It has been more successful than many rival online platforms at fostering a set of creators who produce high-quality educational content; check out channels like Crash Course and Veritasium.
And then there are all the university lectures. YouTube abounds with whole semesters of popular courses from the country's most prestigious schools. A few years ago, I went on a Shakespeare bender because I found an irresistible set of lectures by Marjorie Garber, a Shakespeare expert at Harvard. I learned of Richard Feynman's greatness after watching some of his famous lectures. And if you ever find yourself missing high school chemistry, do yourself a favor and watch the M.I.T. professor Donald Sadoway's intro course.
A lot of parents are leery of YouTube, and I don't think they're wrong to worry. There is a lot of terrible stuff there -- videos that are hateful, ignorant, foolish, conspiratorial or otherwise inappropriate. There's also a lot of plain inanity; a huge part of YouTube is no better than the vast wasteland of pre-golden-age television.
But this is unavoidable; there are also a lot of terrible books in the library. At the same time, I am routinely stunned by some of the things my kids have learned from YouTube that I never could have when I was their age. We were watching "Saving Private Ryan" the other day when my 12-year-old began pointing out historical inaccuracies in the film's depiction of D-Day. I don't think I'd even heard of D-Day at his age. Thanks to his copious consumption of YouTube war documentaries, he can't stop talking about the North African campaign.
Whither Google search, in all this? Many of my Google searches are navigational (e.g., looking up a Wikipedia page or an article I read last week) or in some other way very simple (looking for some word's synonyms, tomorrow's weather). For anything more, it's Google's sibling I'll check first.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 2021, the global music company BMG was looking for a hit in France's growing hip-hop market when its executives came up with a strategy: They would sign Freeze Corleone, a rising rapper on the Parisian scene with an aura of mystique, a hit album and more than a million monthly listeners on Spotify.
There was one problem. Freeze Corleone had been widely condemned in Europe for antisemitic lyrics. "I arrive determined like Adolf in the 1930s," he rapped in French in one 2018 song, and, in another, "Everything for the family, so that my children live like Jewish rentiers," a word often associated with landlords. Other tracks have included conspiracy theories about 9/11 and a shout-out to "the Aryans."
Just a year before BMG's deal with him, Freeze Corleone had been dropped by his previous label, the French arm of the giant Universal Music, which said that his music "amplified unacceptable racist statements."
"In order to mitigate the risk of possible controversy," BMG executives wrote in a memo, they had a workaround. The contract with Freeze Corleone stipulated that the label had the right to approve his lyrics and that it would keep BMG's involvement with his career hidden, according to documents and internal emails reviewed by The New York Times.
"No BMG logo anywhere on the release," Dominique Casimir, one of the company's most senior executives, emailed to a company lawyer and other executives.
She also demanded there would be no announcement heralding the deal. "No signing picture," Ms. Casimir wrote. "Sorry to be this strict."
A few weeks later, in October 2021, BMG signed a one-album deal with Freeze Corleone worth more than one million euros, or about $ 1.1 million.
In the end, BMG didn't put out the album. In a recent interview, Ms. Casimir said that she had decided to cancel the deal the day before the release of its first single.
But the story of BMG and Freeze Corleone raises questions about why BMG executives had signed him in the first place while going to great lengths to conceal the relationship. And it offers an object lesson in the temptations and risks corporations face when they seek to capitalize on the notoriety of pop-culture figures. That tension played out on a bigger stage last year when, amid a rising tide of antisemitism, Adidas ended its lucrative partnership with Kanye West after he made antisemitic comments.
In the interview, Ms. Casimir spoke about the challenges of monitoring a large pipeline of content at a multinational company; said that the decision to omit BMG's name from the album had been made mutually with the artist; and described BMG's ultimate decision to scrap its deal with Freeze Corleone as a sign that its content moderation policies had worked.
"People make mistakes," she said. "We caught the mistake. And whatever the outcome of that mistake is, we have to deal with that."
A Fraught History
This was not the first time that BMG, and Ms. Casimir, had to scramble to minimize damage over antisemitic lyrics.
In 2018, the company was at the center of a media firestorm over an album it had released the year before, "Jung Brutal Gutaussehend 3" ("Young Brutal Good-Looking 3"), by a pair of German rappers, Kollegah and Farid Bang. Despite lyrics like "My body is more defined than Auschwitz prisoners" and "make another Holocaust, show up with a Molotov," the LP had become a monster hit.
When that record (which BMG executives now refer to as "JBG") won best hip-hop/urban album at the Echo awards, Germany's equivalent of the Grammys, other artists revolted. Some, like the classical conductor Daniel Barenboim and Klaus Voormann, the musician and artist who worked with the Beatles, returned their prizes in protest. The media and politicians in Germany -- where there are strict laws against hate speech and Nazi propaganda -- zeroed in on the uproar. The Echo awards were discontinued permanently.
The rebuke was felt particularly strongly at BMG, which is part of the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann. In 2002, Bertelsmann had apologized for its past ties to the Nazi regime.
In response to the uproar, BMG said it would give 100,000 euros to a campaign against antisemitism. It sponsored a series of songwriting workshops centered on opposing hate speech through music.
Ms. Casimir, who had overseen the deal for "JBG" as the managing director of BMG's German market, became a public face of the company's campaign. "Given Germany's history, it is everyone's responsibility to take a stand against antisemitism and hate," she said in a news release.
The company enlisted the help of Ben Lesser, a Holocaust survivor who speaks to groups around the world through his Zachor Holocaust Remembrance Foundation. Soon after the awards, Mr. Lesser spent about three hours at a theater in Berlin, sharing his wrenching personal story with BMG employees and local schoolchildren, he and his daughter Gail Lesser-Gerber said in an interview.
BMG asked Mr. Lesser, now 94, to take part in a songwriting workshop in Los Angeles in early 2019. At the five-day event, he consulted with musicians as they wrote and recorded tracks with uplifting messages, including "Letter to the World," sung by Emily Vaughn.
The label let Mr. Lesser know that to support his efforts to eradicate antisemitism, it would give the foundation the revenue generated by the songs.
"Altogether, it's been less than $ 100," Ms. Lesser-Gerber said. But she said that money was not the incentive. "The motivation was to get the message out."
Lyrics About Hitler and Jews
Freeze Corleone rarely speaks to the news media. His real name is Issa Lorenzo Diakhaté, and he was born in a suburb of Paris in 1992. His father is Senegalese and his mother Italian. The rapper did not respond to numerous messages sent by email and social media requesting comment for this article. A business associate who helped him arrange his deal with BMG declined to comment.
Yet he speaks through his music. Rapping in a low voice, over minor-key piano figures, he performs a variation of drill, a hip-hop style often filled with dark tones and violent imagery.
Many of his lyrics feature standard hip-hop tropes, like allusions to sports and pop culture. On one track he rhymes the name of Larry Bird, the Boston Celtics legend, with that of Marty Byrde, the money launderer played by Jason Bateman on Netflix's "Ozark." But a thread of antisemitism runs throughout his work, manifested in Nazi references, dismissals of the Holocaust, and slurs and stereotypes about Jews.
He has boasted of having "the propaganda techniques of Goebbels" and "big ambitions" like "the young Adolf." In one song, "Le Chen," from 2016, he rapped: "I've got to get the khaliss moving in my community like a Jew." In Wolof, a language spoken in Senegal, where he spent time growing up, khaliss means money.
Olivier Lamm, a music critic for the French newspaper Libération, said that "the thematic substance of Freeze Corleone's rap is obsessively antisemitic." He cited an example from one of the rapper's early tracks in which he used a profanity in dismissing the Shoah -- a term for the Holocaust -- and pointed to lines on his latest album, "Riyad Sadio," that seem to refer to Israel and Jews, with key words bleeped out.
In 2020, Universal Music France released "La Menace Fantôme" ("The Phantom Menace"), which went double platinum in France, selling the equivalent of 200,000 copies there. Lyrics highlighted "Aryans," though did not explicitly address Jews.
But the album's popularity drew attention to Freeze Corleone's earlier lyrics about Hitler and Jewish landlords, and in the resulting controversy, he was dropped by Universal.
"Finally free," the rapper tweeted.
Freeze Corleone's name on a marquee continues to draw protests. A concert planned for late last year in Montreal was canceled after it drew condemnation from some leaders in the local Jewish community. Local officials in Rennes, France, have asked organizers to remove him from a festival next month.
The Fine Print
BMG executives knew that signing Freeze Corleone could result in blowback, according to internal documents, but they were attracted to his market potential. "This signing will strengthen BMG France's position on the strategic market of urban music and hopefully bring our first platinum local record, a key milestone to sign bigger urban acts later," read an internal investment request memo.
The memo, sent in September 2021 by two executives in the company's French office, weighed the risks of hate speech against the financial upside of working with him.
Pro: "Freeze Corleone is France's fastest growing artist in the last 2 years," the executives, Sylvain Gazaignes and Ronan Fiacre, wrote in the memo. "Riyad Sadio," his album with Ashe 22, another French rapper, was ready to go and "would really help us meet our revenue target," another document read, and it projected revenue of 1.2 million euros from the project and profit of 155,000 euros.
Con: "Freeze Corleone faced controversy when releasing his first album in 2020," the BMG memo noted, with understatement. An investigation, the memo added, had been opened by French authorities "on the grounds of incitement to racial hatred," but had concluded "there was no ground for prosecution."
In fact, that investigation was closed with no charges brought because the statute of limitations had passed, a spokesman for the Paris prosecutor's office told The Times.
According to BMG documents, no money would be paid until executives had listened to and approved the lyrics. There would be none of the usual publicity at the time of signing the deal and "the release will be white-labelled" -- meaning that no BMG logo would appear on the music or marketing materials.
The contract was executed a few weeks later, with BMG stipulating that the new album had been listened to and approved. Under the terms of the contract, that should have guaranteed Freeze Corleone at least his initial payment of 500,000 euros. BMG declined to comment about whether it had paid him the money.
When the two BMG employees in France approached her about the deal, Ms. Casimir, who by then had been given oversight of most of the European market, said she told them that it can be difficult to draw the proper line between artistic freedom and language that crosses lines of propriety.
"You have to check the back story," she said she told them. "You have to understand you work for a German company. You have to understand the history, because 'JBG' is a history. I mean, I lived in that moment."
The French employees assured her that the lyrics would be "clean," she said, and that they would vet them before paying Freeze Corleone. Neither Mr. Gazaignes nor Mr. Fiacre responded to text messages seeking comment.
BMG executives cleared the lyrics of Freeze Corleone's album, "Riyad Sadio," and prepared to release its first single, "Scellé Part. 4," in late October.
At the last minute, the label abruptly pulled back. Ms. Casimir said that days before the song's scheduled release, she decided to have her team in Germany review Freeze Corleone's past lyrics.
"I must say, that was a very fast decision, the moment we translated some of those lyrics," Ms. Casimir said. "We called the French team, said, 'You have to end this relationship."'
She said she had alerted Hartwig Masuch, the BMG chief executive, about the termination, and that "he agreed with the next steps." BMG did not make Mr. Masuch available for comment.
After BMG canceled the deal, Freeze Corleone released the album independently. It has had modest success, drawing more than 40 million streams on Spotify.
Ms. Casimir said that two of her employees in France no longer work for BMG as a result of the episode. "It has consequences," she said. BMG executives declined to name which employees left the company; Mr. Gazaignes remains a top executive in the French division.
In 2022, Ms. Casimir was promoted to chief content officer, and was given a seat on BMG's board.

BMG executives cleared the lyrics of Freeze Corleone’s album, “Riyad Sadio,” and prepared to release its first single, “Scellé Part. 4,” in late October.
At the last minute, the label abruptly pulled back. Casimir said that days before the song’s scheduled release, she decided to have her team in Germany review Freeze Corleone’s past lyrics.
“I must say, that was a very fast decision the moment we translated some of those lyrics,” Casimir said. “We called the French team, said, ‘You have to end this relationship.’”
She said she had alerted Hartwig Masuch, the BMG CEO, about the termination and that “he agreed with the next steps.” BMG did not make Masuch available for comment.
After BMG canceled the deal, Freeze Corleone released the album independently. It has had modest success, drawing more than 40 million streams on Spotify.
Casimir said that two of her employees in France no longer work for BMG as a result of the episode. “It has consequences,” she said. BMG executives declined to name which employees left the company; Gazaignes remains a top executive in the French division.
In 2022, Casimir was promoted to chief content officer and was given a seat on BMG’s board. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: She is making her professional stage debut in the Off Broadway drama, and fulfilling a childhood dream. "It's transformative," she said.
Way back in 2020, when Donald Trump was still in office and many Americans were stuck at home, Sarah Cooper became Internet-famous in a most idiosyncratic way: by lip-syncing some of the president's more inartful musings.
Using tools she had at hand -- her wit, her phone -- she built an enormous audience for her short-form videos mocking Trump's remarks on everything from the coronavirus to crustaceans.
The exercise was a bit of a lark, and a bit of a coping mechanism. But for Cooper, an actor-writer-comedian who had had little luck breaking into the entertainment world, it was also a game-changer: She finally signed with an agent (at William Morris Endeavor, one of the biggest talent agencies); she starred in her own Netflix special ("Everything's Fine," created with Natasha Lyonne and Maya Rudolph); she adapted one of her books, "How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men's Feelings," into a pilot (it did not get picked up, but was still "an amazing experience"); and she shot a Jerry Seinfeld film ("Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story," currently in postproduction).
Now, at age 45, she is at last doing the thing she has dreamed of since she was a child: performing in a play. She is making her professional stage debut in "The Wanderers," a drama by Anna Ziegler that is in previews Off Broadway at the Roundabout Theater Company, with the actress Katie Holmes also in the cast.
Cooper, who last performed in theater as an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, has had a circuitous path back. Born in Jamaica, she immigrated to the United States with her parents when she was 3, and at first found little family enthusiasm for her artistic aspirations. "They didn't think that I'd be able to support myself as an actress," she said, "which, you know, they had a good point."
At college she switched her major from theater to economics; after graduating, she worked in tech design. At 30, she quit to try her hand at acting; when that wasn't going well, she turned to standup comedy, "and then," she says, "I went broke."
She wound up managing a design team at Google, but quit that to write. And then came the pandemic, the videos, and all that followed.
"Those videos absolutely changed my life," she said during a recent interview at her apartment high above Downtown Brooklyn, overlooking the Statue of Liberty. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
What is "The Wanderers" about?
"The Wanderers" is about two couples. One couple is very much an arranged marriage, in the Orthodox Jewish community, and the other couple is not arranged. On the surface, it looks like one couple has all of these freedoms and the other one doesn't. And yet the struggles are very similar between the two.
Tell me about your role.
I play Sophie, and I am half-Jewish/half-Black. I had a huge failure earlier in my career, but my husband is very successful. When we meet Sophie, it's about 10 years into their marriage, and she is struggling with her identity as a mother and a wife, and how that is affecting her longing to be a writer. And she's really feeling distant from her husband.
You had a marriage end during the pandemic. How does taking this role resonate for you?
It's very personal: I'm a writer as well; I have a lot of impostor syndrome as well; I question my talent on a nightly basis. I just relate to this character so much.
It's been three years since your first Trump video, which you called "How to Medical." How do you see that chapter of your life?
Right afterward I was very scared of just being known as the Trump Girl, and felt like I wanted to distance myself from it. But I meet people who just come up to me and they just go, "You made me laugh when it was so hard to laugh." It's just made me appreciate it a lot more. Those videos helped so many people, and they also helped me. So I'm thankful for it now, even though I know that if I die right now, my obituary would have the name Donald Trump in it, which is not great, but what are you going to do?
Do you ever feel tempted to do it again?
People ask me to do it all the time, and I have no desire. I like the idea that it exposed the meaninglessness of his words, but I think now that it's been exposed, there's nothing left to really do with it.
And you're not going to turn it into a cycle with other characters?
I've noticed I am very good at lip syncing, so I'll never say never. But right now I'm really enjoying acting, which is really what my childhood dream was.
So what is it like, being in a play?
We did a table read, and table reads are always very scary because you think if you do it wrong, you're going to get fired immediately. And then we moved very quickly to getting on our feet in the rehearsal space for four weeks, which was such a gift. And then you get on that stage, and the lights hit you, and you're in a costume, and you're looking at this man who is just this actor but now he's your husband -- it's transformative. Oddly I feel it's where exactly I need to be and where exactly I belong.
What are you learning?
I'm working on my voice, mainly. I'm learning to breathe while I'm speaking, learning how to project, learning about my diaphragm, doing morning and afternoon exercises. I have to say the name of a Philip Roth book, "Sabbath's Theater," so all I do every day is say "Sabbath's Theater," "Sabbath's Theater," "Sabbath's Theater." It's not that easy. I got a lot of opportunities by not using my voice, and so now I really have to figure out what that means to use my voice.
Have you been seeing theater?
I have seen "Take Me Out" four times. I just love that play. Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Jesse Williams are so great. And masculine vulnerability is just wonderful to watch. I also saw "Tina" twice -- I see a play and I have to go see it again. I don't know what I will see next but if I love it I will see it multiple times.
I'm having a hard time figuring out the overlap between "Tina" and "Take Me Out."
Well they both start with T! Actually, I don't know what it is. With "Tina," it was the contrast between that forward-facing, "I'm doing this amazing performance; I'm making you happy; I'm making you dance" and then, a second later, "I'm beaten by my husband." Showing how those two things could be happening at the same time -- this awful, awful struggle and this amazing performance -- that was incredible to watch. And also, Adrienne Warren -- her voice and her presence was just so amazing.
So what do you hope is next for you?
I am writing a memoir that's coming out in October. And I want to tell stories. That's really what I want to do, and whether that's through writing, through acting, through standup, I want to be able to do whatever it takes to tell stories.
Why a memoir?
My very first book was "100 Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings," and I look back now and realize that a lot of that was inspired by my father, because my father always looks very smart. My memoir is about embracing looking foolish. The more foolish I can allow myself to look, the better, because that's exposing who I am more, and not conforming to what I think people want to see.
Do you miss Trump?
In 2020, he said some brilliantly stupid things. You can't write that stuff. The stuff that he said, it was gold. So I don't want him back, but making those videos was a lot of fun.

Full text: The art collective CFGNY held a conceptual fashion show at the Japan Society.
New York Fashion Week was more than 10 days away, but CFGNY, an art collective founded in New York City that challenges dominant narratives around Asian American identity, held a conceptual fashion show at the Japan Society in Manhattan on Saturday.
CFGNY, which stands for Concept Foreign Garments New York (its original name included the words "cute" and "gay"), is led by four New York artists -- Tin Nguyen, Daniel Chew, Ten Izu and Kirsten Kilponen -- who use art and fashion to explore the term "vaguely Asian" and how it is often used to homogenize very different cultures.
"CFGNY is a project of critique, but we're also interested in playfulness," Mr. Chew, 35, said backstage before the show.
Fashion show front rows usually hold fashion editors and retail buyers, but here there was a cross section of the city's Asian and queer-friendly creative class. Attendees included Beverly Nguyen, 32, a Vietnamese American stylist and design influencer who wore a chenille skirt by CFGNY made of large bumble bee patches; Kiko Soirée, 32, a drag artist and comedian, wore white knee-high socks that read "camp"; and Doris Ho Kane, 42, a Vietnamese bakery owner and archivist, wearing orange drawstring pants under a long off-white coat.
They were joined by reality TV stars, pastry chefs, party promoters, jewelry designers, museum curators and activists.
By 7 p.m. the 350 attendees had found their places in the sprawling marble lobby that evokes a Japanese garden with bonsai trees, rock beds and shoji walls. A snaking catwalk had been carved out with temporary seating and wooden walkways over an indoor pond.
The last person to take her seat was the mother of one of the founders, Ngoc Le, 62, who came in from Massachusetts and made Vietnamese dishes for the cast and crew earlier in the day. Dressed in a conservative black dress and a single string of pearls, she filmed the crowd with her phone as she made her way through the room.
Around 7:20 p.m., the lights dimmed and a howling soundscape by Okkyung Lee, a South Korean cellist, started. CFGNY had its network of artists, influencers, designers and performers walk as models, instead of professionals. They drew from diverse pockets of the Asian diaspora.
The show opened with the artist Stewart Uoo, who served corporate realness in a sage silk shirt tucked into cobalt chinos, with a sparkly dash of rhinestone fixed to one leg. Miho Hatori, an artist and co-founder of the band Cibo Matto, wore a baseball cap with an olive green work jacket and an indigo blue silk skirt with two stuffed animals tucked inside.
Blake Abbie, 32, who stars on the Netflix reality show "Bling Empire: New York," wore a blue shirt with English non-words. And West Dakota, a Brooklyn Liberation March organizer, wore a sheer mesh top, Jelly platform heels and a skirt made from cartoonish caterpillar patches.
There was Kawaii cuteness, references to K-pop and anime, blurred gender lines and a mishmash of sartorial references including tartan, animal prints, Western logos and parachute pants. About 13 minutes and 35 looks later, the show ended.
After the designers took their bows, the chairs were cleared, a bar was set up, and sushi was served for an after-party in the lobby. (Some guests lingered upstairs to see CFGNY's art installation, part of "Refashioning," on view until Feb. 19.)
A group gathered around Helen Chan, a retired real estate agent who lives in Brooklyn, impossible to miss with her big purple-silver hair. She was still wearing the bodycon mesh dress and patchwork plaid corset she wore in the show.
Ms. Chan said she was buying bananas a couple of weeks ago at the Trader Joe's on Grand Street when Mr. Nguyen approached her to walk in this show. "My husband said, 'Why do that? You're a nut head,"' Ms. Chan said, laughing. When asked her age, she replied, "my mother is 102."

NEW YORK — Way back in 2020, when Donald Trump was still in office and many Americans were stuck at home, Sarah Cooper became Internet famous in a most idiosyncratic way: by lip-syncing some of the president’s more inartful musings.
Using tools she had at hand — her wit, her phone — she built an enormous audience for her short-form videos mocking Trump’s remarks on everything from the coronavirus to crustaceans.
The exercise was a bit of a lark and a bit of a coping mechanism. But for Cooper, an actor-writer-comedian who had had little luck breaking into the entertainment world, it was also a game-changer. She finally signed with an agent (at William Morris Endeavor, one of the biggest talent agencies); she starred in her own Netflix special (“Everything’s Fine,” created with Natasha Lyonne and Maya Rudolph); she adapted one of her books, “How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men’s Feelings,” into a pilot (it did not get picked up but was still “an amazing experience”); and she shot a Jerry Seinfeld film (“Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story,” currently in postproduction).
Now, at age 45, she is at last doing the thing she has dreamed of since she was a child: performing in a play. She is making her professional stage debut in “The Wanderers,” a drama by Anna Ziegler that is in previews off-Broadway at the Roundabout Theater Company, with actress Katie Holmes also in the cast.
Cooper, who last performed in theater as an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, has had a circuitous path back. Born in Jamaica, she immigrated to the United States with her parents when she was 3 and at first found little family enthusiasm for her artistic aspirations. “They didn’t think that I’d be able to support myself as an actress,” she said, “which, you know, they had a good point.”

I also saw “Tina” twice; I see a play, and I have to go see it again. I don’t know what I will see next, but if I love it, I will see it multiple times.
Q: I’m having a hard time figuring out the overlap between “Tina” and “Take Me Out.”
A: Well, they both start with T! Actually, I don’t know what it is. With “Tina,” it was the contrast between that forward-facing, “I’m doing this amazing performance; I’m making you happy; I’m making you dance,” and then, a second later, “I’m beaten by my husband.” Showing how those two things could be happening at the same time — this awful, awful struggle and this amazing performance — that was incredible to watch. And also, Adrienne Warren — her voice and her presence was just so amazing.
Q: So, what do you hope is next for you?
A: I am writing a memoir that’s coming out in October. And I want to tell stories. That’s really what I want to do, and whether that’s through writing, through acting, through standup, I want to be able to do whatever it takes to tell stories.
Q: Why a memoir?
A: My very first book was “100 Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings,” and I look back now and realize that a lot of that was inspired by my father, because my father always looks very smart. My memoir is about embracing looking foolish. The more foolish I can allow myself to look, the better, because that’s exposing who I am more and not conforming to what I think people want to see.
Q: Do you miss Trump?
A: In 2020, he said some brilliantly stupid things. You can’t write that stuff. The stuff that he said, it was gold. So I don’t want him back, but making those videos was a lot of fun. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Two days after Christmas, Ann-Helén Laestadius found herself being gently pummeled by reindeer.
Taking advantage of the bluish glow that passes for daylight in Sweden's far north at that time of year, she had left her parents' cozy kitchen and driven to the corral where her cousin keeps his herd during winter. She was there for a photo shoot, but first, she had to help feed the animals, extracting half-frozen tufts of lichen from a mesh sack as the reindeer jostled her impatiently. Even after a close brush with the pointy end of an antler, she looked on them indulgently.
"For the Sámi," Laestadius said, referring to the Indigenous group of which she is a member, "Reindeer are not just animals. They are life."
That lesson is at the heart of her novel, "Stolen," which comes out in English from Scribner on Jan. 31. It explains why the book's Sámi characters perceive the killing of their reindeer as a crime not against their property, but against their people as a whole. And thanks to the book's success, it is also a lesson that Sweden, whose colonization of the Sámi has been long and oppressive, may slowly be learning.
An Indigenous people, the Sámi, who number around 80,000, inhabit a vast territory that stretches across the Arctic areas of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia's Kola Peninsula. For centuries, their language and culture have been forcibly suppressed by national governments that also stripped their land rights and developed industries that threatened the habitats on which their livelihoods and culture depend.
To this day, the Sámi are engaged in legal and political struggles to protect their lands from mineral and timber extraction, and their herding routes from energy projects. And although the Nordic countries are widely perceived, both abroad and at home, as progressive and egalitarian, many of the Sámi who live within their borders say they remain targets of discrimination, racism and -- through their reindeer -- violence.
A case in point: After the Swedish Supreme Court in 2020 granted the Sámi the exclusive right to manage hunting and fishing rights in the area of Girjas Samby, near the Norwegian border, reindeer killings (which had long plagued the community), increased markedly. It was an expression, many Sámi believe, of anger among local Swedes who resented losing their hunting rights to a people they had long denigrated. "They kill our reindeer," Laestadius said, "because they can't kill us."
Born to a Sámi mother and a father who is Tornedalian, another of Sweden's ethnic minorities, Laestadius, 51, grew up outside Kiruna, a mining city 200 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle. Early in life, she began internalizing shame about her identity, she said. Her mother spoke Sámi with her parents and neighbors, but would switch to Swedish whenever she went into the city.
"It made me automatically start to think something is wrong," Laestadius said of her mother's code-switching. "We are something wrong."
That sense grew stronger once she started school, she said, and faced bullying and rejection from the non-Sámi children. "I started to realize that I should be quiet about who I am."
In her twenties, Laestadius moved to Stockholm where she worked as a crime reporter for several Swedish newspapers. But gradually, as both a journalist and then an author of young adult books, she began looking back at the world in which she had grown up. Her first book, published in 2007, was about a 13-year-old girl secretly studying the Sámi language.
"Stolen," her first adult novel, also begins with a young Sámi girl. Elsa is 9 years old when she witnesses the malicious killing of her reindeer calf. As she grows up, the trauma of that moment, coupled with other brutalities -- ostracizing at school, a friend's suicide, a police force unable or unwilling to investigate the ongoing reindeer killings -- transmutes into rage.
Laestadius carried around the idea for a novel for seven years, she said, but kept herself from writing it out of concern that she didn't have the right to tell reindeer herders' stories since she herself did not come from a herding family. But after two of her young cousins -- brothers -- killed themselves, she felt she could no longer avoid writing about the impact of imposed inferiority, she said.
"Suicide is something that every Sámi family has been through," Laestadius said. "I wanted people to know; this is what happens when you treat people like this, when they get so much hatred."
As she began talking to herders for research, her sense of urgency grew.
"Everybody told the same story," she said. "I could feel their sorrow and their desperation."
When a young herder gave her copies of a hundred reports of reindeer killings that had been filed with the police without any arrests being made, Laestadius had had enough: "I wrote this book with a lot of anger."
She also wrote it with sensitivity and insight for the subtleties of Sámi life. From the pride that Elsa takes in her gákti -- the traditional, ribbon-trimmed Sámi dress -- to the embarrassing way that tourists gush over her, "Stolen" illuminates a culture that many in Sweden have long ignored or reviled. Sámi words dot the text -- an intentional strategy for overcoming the shame that prevented her own mother from teaching her the language. "It is my sorrow that I don't speak Sámi," Laestadius said. "So it became even more important for me to have it in my books."
Although "Stolen" is fiction, some Sámi have found it a welcome depiction of their reality -- including the reindeer killings that many Sámi organizations are fighting to have classified as hate crimes. "Ann-Helén depicts nuances in the culture that I'm not sure non-Sámi would pick up on," said Åsa Larsson Blind, vice president of the Sámi Council, an NGO that works to protect Sámi rights. "It's quite an extraordinary talent that she can write a story about something that is quite specific to a small culture, but that is interesting to a wider audience."
"Stolen" won Sweden's reader-voted Book of the Year Prize in 2021, and is being adapted into a film for Netflix.
Laestadius is now part of a large community of Sámi artists, musicians and writers whose work contains political messages. "Within Sámi culture, artists have always been activists," says Larsson. "It's natural for them to express strong political statements through art, and it can be more powerful too, because people tend to be more open to art."
In recent years, a number of Sámi artists, musicians, and writers have gained new attention and acclaim for their work within Nordic countries. Director Amanda Kernell's film, "Sámi Blood," took the top prize at the 2017 Gothenburg Film Festival. Mats Jonsson's "When We Were Sámi," which tracks the author's attempt to reconcile his recently discovered Sámi ancestry with his Swedish identity, became, in 2021, the first graphic novel ever nominated for the August Prize, a prestigious literary award. Artist Maret Anne Sara's moving piece of protest art, Pile O'Sápmi, crowns the entrance to Norway's recently inaugurated National Museum in Oslo. The Nordic Pavilion at the 2022 Venice Biennale was devoted entirely to Sámi artists.
In the eastern city of Umea, Krister Stoor, a professor of language studies who teaches "Stolen" as part of his university curriculum, has seen a major transformation in the local literary festival. "This year, there are so many Sámi authors," he said. "Ten years ago you would have had a hard time finding one."
Although the Church of Sweden has apologized for its role in repression against the Sámi -- including by overseeing boarding schools that forcibly assimilated Sámi children -- the Swedish government has not.
It is uncertain whether the recent outpouring of cultural energy and interest are affecting Swedish attitudes and policy, but there are signs of change. In December, the Swedish government agreed to return for burial the remains of 18 Sámi whose bodies had been used in the early 20th century in now-discredited race-based research, and it has promised to facilitate the repatriation of Sámi artifacts currently held in Swedish museums.
At least among some sectors of Swedish society, there is growing awareness of Sweden's responsibility for the treatment of the Sámi. In a glowing review of "Stolen" for the newspaper Expressen, Gunilla Brodrej, a culture editor, expressed shame for once dismissing as unrealistic a television series that depicted the racism the Sámi face.
"In school, I, and even my children, learn that we Swedes have arranged everything in a very good way for the Sámi," she said in an interview. "But when you read a book like this you realize that it's a much darker story than we ever learned."
Laestadius too has seen some impact. Local newspapers are covering the reindeer killings more frequently, and there are signs that authorities may be paying more attention to the cases. "Usually they never come," she said of the police, with a wry grin. "But last summer when a reindeer was killed in a little village, they sent a helicopter."
She is still angry, however, and she still has more to reveal. In February, her latest novel will come out in Sweden. It depicts the brutal conditions at the boarding schools Sámi children were sent to, and is based on her mother's experience.
As the noontime sun began to set, Laestadius posed for a few more pictures in the snow-clad village where her "Stolen" is set.
"Now we have the opportunity and the power to tell our story," she said. "It is ours to tell."

Gen X Nostalgia Gets a Sing-Along: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The educational snippets are the ultimate font of Gen X nostalgia. But what is it we're nostalgic for?
When I was in second grade, my teacher held a contest: The first students to memorize their multiplication tables would get dinner at McDonald's. I was one of them. I'd like to credit hard work or the motivation of those golden fries, but in truth it was easy. I learned it from "Schoolhouse Rock."
It was not the last time that watching too much TV would pay off for me, but it was perhaps the sweetest.
If you were an American kid around when I was (nineteen-seventy-cough), you probably have "Schoolhouse Rock" hard-wired into your brain too. The musical shorts, which began airing on ABC in 1973, taught Generation X multiplication, grammar, history and, eventually, nostalgia.
That last lesson stuck best. Winona Ryder and company crooned "Conjunction Junction" and "I'm Just a Bill" in the 1994 generational-statement film "Reality Bites." De La Soul borrowed "Three Is a Magic Number" as the backbone for their buoyant self-introduction, "The Magic Number," in 1989. Nostalgia for "Schoolhouse Rock" is now itself old enough to be nostalgic for.
On Wednesday, ABC will tap into that spirit with a prime time "50th Anniversary Singalong," in which the Black Eyed Peas, the Muppets, Shaquille O'Neal and others will hook up the words, phrases and clauses of the Saturday-morning favorites.
The special promises wholesome family fun, and I can think of worse things to do on a weeknight than musically unpacking my adjectives in the judgment-free zone of my living room. But nostalgia is not just a fun emotion. Like some of the best "Schoolhouse Rock" songs, it carries a note of wistfulness.
In this case, it's a reminder of a time when network TV gave us a common culture, language and lyrics, before we were sliced into subcultures and demographics. Pre-internet, pre-cable, pre-DVD -- pre-VHS, even -- "Schoolhouse Rock" convened a classroom of millions for three-minute servings of revolutionary art alongside installments of "The Great Grape Ape Show."
Like much classic kids' TV, "Schoolhouse Rock" was brought to you by Madison Avenue. The ad executive David McCall, who noticed that his son could memorize pop songs but struggled with arithmetic, suggested to George Newall, a creative director, and Thomas Yohe, an art director, that they figure out how to set math to music.
As Newell told the Times in 1994, they pitched the idea to Michael Eisner, then the director of children's programming at ABC, who happened to be meeting with the legendary Looney Tunes animator Chuck Jones. "I think you should buy it right away," Jones said.
Unlike the dutiful news interstitials that vitamin-fortified other Saturday-morning cartoon lineups, "Schoolhouse Rock" harnessed the power of comedy and ear worms. The facts and figures made it educational. But they weren't what made it art.
That was the animation, psychedelically colorful and chock-full of rapid-fire slapstick gags. Above all, there was the sophisticated music. The jazz composer Bob Dorough wrote the banger-filled first season, "Multiplication Rock," surveying a range of styles from the duodecimal prog-rock of "Little Twelvetoes" to the spiraling lullaby of "Figure Eight."
The lyrics were sly and funny but could also detour, like a fidgety schoolkid sitting by the window, into daydreams. The blissful "Three Is a Magic Number" isn't just a primer on multiples; it's a rumination on the triad foundations of the universe, from geometry to love. (If your voice does not break singing, "A man and a woman had a little baby," you're doing something wrong.)
The following seasons, about grammar, American history and science, added other contributors, including Lynn Ahrens, the future Broadway songwriter thanks to whom an entire generation cannot recite the preamble to the Constitution without breaking into song.
The words and numbers in "Schoolhouse Rock" were never just words and numbers. Like the early years of "Sesame Street," the shorts had an anarchic spirit and a pluralistic sensibility. "I Got Six" is a funk explosion whose Afrocentric animation includes a dashiki-ed African prince with six rings on all 10 fingers. "Verb: That's What's Happening" -- imagine if Curtis Mayfield taught your English class -- depicts a Black superhero long before Black Panther made it to the movie screen.
When my kids were school-aged, I got the full "Schoolhouse Rock" DVD set for them, which is to say, I got it for me. (You can now stream the '70s seasons, plus a brief 1980s series about computers and a clunky 1990s revival, "Money Rock," through Disney+.)
Rewatching the series taught me about a new subject: Time.
The songs are as catchy as ever. But to screen "Schoolhouse Rock" as an adult is to visit a different period in cultural history, and not just because of the bell-bottoms. The America of "Schoolhouse Rock" was divided by Vietnam and Watergate, but it could at least subscribe to basic common facts and civic principles.
Consider Bill, the underdog paper hero of "I'm Just a Bill," longing to become a law that would keep that cartoon school bus safe at railroad crossings. Now he's a time traveler, from a pre-Reagan age when government activism, however imperfect, was considered a force for good.
Today, with culture-warring politicians like the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, red-penciling school curriculums, weaponizing pronouns and hammering history teachers for "indoctrination," the potential land mines add up. "The Great American Melting Pot" did not imagine a future president telling asylum seekers, "Our country is full." When "Interjections" depicted a doctor giving a child a shot, it did not anticipate legislators denouncing Big Bird for advocating childhood vaccination.
(Likewise, when "Elementary, My Dear" taught counting by twos with a gospel-style Noah's Ark song, it didn't fear repercussions for bringing religion into kids' TV.)
And that's before you even get to "Science Rock." "The Energy Blues" makes a matter-of-fact pitch for conservation that would cause smoke eruptions today. (In 2009, a climate-focused season, "Earth Rock" went straight to DVD.) When "Schoolhouse Rock" showed kids a three-minute video on how the body worked, there was no internet algorithm to suggest a rebuttal by someone who "did his own research."
That said, I wouldn't romanticize the "Schoolhouse Rock" era as a paradise of educational consensus. In 1974, the year before the "America Rock" season began, protesters against desegregation in Boston threw rocks at buses carrying Black students. And the series had its own blind spots, which historians and educators have since pointed out.
In particular, "America Rock," an upbeat celebration of the bicentennial, covers the American Revolution and women's suffrage but skips over the Civil War and slavery. (The Roots filled in this hole in a 2017 episode of "black-ish" with "I Am a Slave," about Juneteenth.) "Elbow Room" is a jaunty story of westward expansion from the point of view of white settlers, with little note of who got elbowed out. (One scene shows a settler taking a toy arrow through his hat.) America's unflattering history didn't make the cut because mass broadcasting meant not alienating the masses.
But whatever its limits, "Schoolhouse Rock" at least told us we were equal: We counted with the same numbers, our hearts pumped the same blood, we were entitled to the same inalienable rights.
And it operated in a period when people saw the same media and accepted the same facts. Months after its premiere, the Watergate hearings also aired on national TV. They were able eventually to turn even many Republicans against President Nixon, in part because Americans watched the same story together, without a partisan cable and internet ecosystem to spin the investigation as a witch hunt.
It's tempting to say that you couldn't make "Schoolhouse Rock" again today. But I'm sure you could, even if it would be slightly different. Current kids' shows like Netflix's "We the People" are in a way exactly that. What you couldn't create again today is the mass audience, or the context in which we assembled, one nation, sitting cross-legged in front of our cathode-ray teacher.
Instead, we have "Schoolhouse Rock" binge-watches and sing-alongs, which, like all exercises in nostalgia, offer the tantalizing pleasure of stretching to touch yesterday, though we know we can't. The past is like infinity, a concept that "Schoolhouse Rock" also introduced to my generation. "No one ever gets there," as "My Hero, Zero" taught us. "But you could try."

Her Culture Was Suppressed for Centuries. Now It Powers Her Bestseller.

Two days after Christmas, Ann-Helén Laestadius found herself being gently pummeled by reindeer.
Taking advantage of the bluish glow that passes for daylight in Sweden’s far north at that time of year, she had left her parents’ cozy kitchen and driven to the corral where her cousin keeps his herd during winter. She was there for a photo shoot, but first, she had to help feed the animals, extracting half-frozen tufts of lichen from a mesh sack as the reindeer jostled her impatiently. Even after a close brush with the pointy end of an antler, she looked on them indulgently.
“For the Sámi,” Laestadius said, referring to the Indigenous group of which she is a member, “reindeer are not just animals. They are life.”
That lesson is at the heart of her novel, “Stolen,” which comes out in English from Scribner on Tuesday. It explains why the book’s Sámi characters perceive the killing of their reindeer as a crime not against their property, but against their people as a whole. And thanks to the book’s success, it is also a lesson that Sweden, whose colonization of the Sámi has been long and oppressive, may slowly be learning.
An Indigenous people, the Sámi, who number around 80,000, inhabit a vast territory that stretches across the Arctic areas of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia’s Kola Peninsula. For centuries, their language and culture have been forcibly suppressed by national governments that also stripped their land rights and developed industries that threatened the habitats on which their livelihoods and culture depend.
To this day, the Sámi are engaged in legal and political struggles to protect their lands from mineral and timber extraction, and their herding routes from energy projects. And although the Nordic countries are widely perceived, both abroad and at home, as progressive and egalitarian, many of the Sámi who live within their borders say they remain targets of discrimination, racism and — through their reindeer — violence.
A case in point: After the Swedish Supreme Court in 2020 granted the Sámi the exclusive right to manage hunting and fishing rights in the area of Girjas Samby, near the Norwegian border, reindeer killings (which had long plagued the community) increased markedly. It was an expression, many Sámi believe, of anger among local Swedes who resented losing their hunting rights to a people they had long denigrated. “They kill our reindeer,” Laestadius said, “because they can’t kill us.”
Born to a Sámi mother and a father who is Tornedalian, another of Sweden’s ethnic minorities, Laestadius, 51, grew up outside Kiruna, a mining city about 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Early in life, she began internalizing shame about her identity, she said. Her mother spoke Sámi with her parents and neighbors, but would switch to Swedish whenever she went into the city.

“Stolen” won Sweden’s reader-voted Book of the Year Prize in 2021, and is being adapted into a film for Netflix.
Laestadius is now part of a large community of Sámi artists, musicians and writers whose work contains political messages. “Within Sámi culture, artists have always been activists,” Larsson said. “It’s natural for them to express strong political statements through art, and it can be more powerful too, because people tend to be more open to art.”
In recent years, a number of Sámi artists, musicians and writers have gained new attention and acclaim for their work within Nordic countries. Director Amanda Kernell’s film, “Sámi Blood,” took the top prize at the 2017 Gothenburg Film Festival. Mats Jonsson’s “When We Were Sámi,” which tracks the author’s attempt to reconcile his recently discovered Sámi ancestry with his Swedish identity, became, in 2021, the first graphic novel ever nominated for the August Prize, a prestigious literary award. Artist Maret Anne Sara’s moving piece of protest art, Pile O’Sápmi, crowns the entrance to Norway’s recently inaugurated National Museum in Oslo. The Nordic Pavilion at the 2022 Venice Biennale was devoted entirely to Sámi artists.
In the eastern city of Umea, Krister Stoor, a professor of language studies who teaches “Stolen” as part of his university curriculum, has seen a major transformation in the local literary festival. “This year, there are so many Sámi authors,” he said. “Ten years ago you would have had a hard time finding one.”
Although the Church of Sweden has apologized for its role in repression against the Sámi — including by overseeing boarding schools that forcibly assimilated Sámi children — the Swedish government has not.
It is uncertain whether the recent outpouring of cultural energy and interest are affecting Swedish attitudes and policy, but there are signs of change. In December, the Swedish government agreed to return for burial the remains of 18 Sámi whose bodies had been used in the early 20th century in now-discredited race-based research, and it has promised to facilitate the repatriation of Sámi artifacts currently held in Swedish museums.
At least among some sectors of Swedish society, there is growing awareness of Sweden’s responsibility for the treatment of the Sámi. In a glowing review of “Stolen” for the newspaper Expressen, Gunilla Brodrej, a culture editor, expressed shame for once dismissing as unrealistic a television series that depicted the racism the Sámi face.
“In school, I, and even my children, learn that we Swedes have arranged everything in a very good way for the Sámi,” she said in an interview. “But when you read a book like this you realize that it’s a much darker story than we ever learned.”
Laestadius has seen some impact. Local newspapers are covering the reindeer killings more frequently, and there are signs that authorities may be paying more attention to the cases. “Usually they never come,” she said of the police, with a wry grin. “But last summer when a reindeer was killed in a little village, they sent a helicopter.”
She is still angry, however, and she still has more to reveal. In February, her latest novel will come out in Sweden. It depicts the brutal conditions at the boarding schools Sámi children were sent to, and is based on her mother’s experience.
As the noontime sun began to set, Laestadius posed for a few more pictures in the snow-clad village where her “Stolen” is set.
“Now we have the opportunity and the power to tell our story,” she said. “It is ours to tell.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

From a Warhol Wig to a Hopper Hat: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's no longer enough to like our favorite artists' works. By putting on Hopper's fedora, Picasso's striped shirt, Warhol's wig or Kahlo's colorful couture, we want to become their avatars.
The Musée Picasso in Paris, home to a vast trove of its namesake's masterworks, is offering a striped Breton shirt that makes it easy to adopt the great Cubist's signature look for a mere $ 70 or so.
On a web page for the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum, in Washington, you can buy high-top sneakers covered in the "infinity net" pattern that is an artistic trademark of Yayoi Kusama, the 93-year-old Japanese art star. They cost $ 360, and the Hirshhorn shop has sold 44 pairs.
The gift shop at the Whitney Museum of American Art displays a $ 118 Hopper hat, a felt fedora that's an almost perfect match for the one in Edward Hopper's most famous self-portrait, which the museum owns.
If visitors are willing to spend that kind of money to dress up like a favorite artist, that's because today's art-loving public finds as much inspiration in creators' personas as in the works they create.
Jennifer Heslin, director of retail operations at the Whitney, said that over her quarter-century in museum marketing, she's seen visitors become ever more interested in goods, like the museum's Hopper hat, that give them "a connection to that creative impulse" in the great artists who act as role models.
One of the world's many immersive "experiences" dedicated to Vincent van Gogh sets itself apart from all others with a virtual-reality component that gives the chance to be "fully immersed in the mind" of van Gogh. An immersive built around Frida Kahlo can proudly proclaim that it is "presented without reproductions of the artist's paintings" so that it can dwell instead on "the incredible story behind the legendary artist." It's been popular enough to get programmed in 15 cities worldwide.
Six decades ago, Andy Warhol helped set us on this course, for good or ill, when he first made his persona count for as much as his paintings or films. The creation that truly changed the whole future of art was the living sculpture called Andy Warhol, forever updated to suit the times it was in.
There was his striped shirt borrowed from Picasso, used to create a cheerful, Pop-y version of Warhol that signaled his ambition to take the Spaniard's place in art. Then there was the vampiric Warhol, in a biker's leather jacket and drug-user's shades. The '70s saw Warhol in jeans, white shirt and tie, casting off his outdated '60s rebellion, and then in the '80s he could be seen in shoulder pads to court the New Wave. And throughout it all that shocking platinum wig, now for sale in any costume store.
An early critic billed Warhol as the culmination of "that curious yet significant tradition in which the artist is his own work of art" -- a tradition that was peaking just when Warhol came on the scene. In the early 1960s, the cutting-edge did its best to dissolve all frontiers between art and life, declaring salad-making an artistic act, or wheeling a baby carriage, or in one sad case, overdosing on drugs.
Warhol conjoined art and life better than almost anyone, and that is what continues to keep him so much in the public eye. Four decades after his death, this winter he's onstage alongside Jean-Michel Basquiat, that other larger-than-art persona, in a Broadway play and is at the heart of two other plays in Chicago, after his star turn last year in "The Andy Warhol Diaries" on Netflix. All those shows let Warhol's artistic creations almost disappear behind the man who created them. He led us to Hopper hats and art-free Kahlo events.
Warhol clearly wasn't the first artist to have a persona that attracted attention. The public's interest in van Gogh was always split between his works and his life story, however little he had planned on that outcome. A host of great women artists took care to craft personas that helped them stand out from a horde of male colleagues. A few years back, a Brooklyn Museum show about Georgia O'Keeffe highlighted the signature outfits she sewed and bought and had herself photographed in. A show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art displayed all the many great photos that spread news of Frida Kahlo's own colorful, well-tended persona. But where the splashy images of those artists helped to pitch works that stood up fine on their own, Warhol's endless Marilyns and Flowers and Soup Cans have come to seem more like mere pointers to their creator.
The fame of Kusama, which only seems to grow by the year, is likewise less about any actual aesthetic rewards delivered by her unending stream of dot-covered objects than about the self-declared madness that gave birth to those dots.
Kusama's dots say "Yayoi was here" as much as they ask for the deepest of readings. Their constant repetition doesn't work to dilute some powerful artistic message, as you could argue is the case with notable repeaters like Gerhard Richter or Richard Serra. Kusama's repetitions, like Warhol's, work wonders in getting her persona known far and wide. Right now, she -- or at least her magnetic persona -- is attracting crowds outside the Fifth Avenue window of Louis Vuitton in New York, in the form of a dot-painting robot avatar, which does its work below a 10-story mural of the artist herself.
Banksy's worldwide street art also plays a role in persona-building, which is surprising given that the Northern Hemisphere's most popular muralist stays anonymous. But that anonymity only increases our fascination with the Man of Mystery behind the work so that in his very absence Banksy comes to matter at least as much as the pictures he puts before us.
Before we get cranky about celebrity replacing aesthetics, we might want to recognize that some of today's best artists do fine work in Warhol's footsteps.
Theaster Gates makes and sells individual art objects that are hard not to like, for their own sakes: lovely sculptures that explore the history and meaning of ceramics; compelling abstractions made out of urban detritus. But I'd say those only take on their full role when seen as elements -- props, almost -- in a larger artistic "project" that includes all the ways Gates intersects with the world, and the art world, wearing hats as urban activist, music impresario, cultural archivist ... and as the best-selling object-maker whose sales fund the rest of what he gets up to. That is, what Theaster Gates does is what makes him matter; his art works are just a small part of that.
There's one object-making artist, in the spotlight right now in New York, whose greatest objects address the very "problem" of the artist's presence as a persona. In his survey show at the Guggenheim Museum, Nick Cave has filled an entire fifth-floor gallery with 16 of his Soundsuits, the elaborate, gewgaw-covered onesies that are quite rightly his signature works.
One covers its wearer head-to-toe in twigs, permitting perfect camouflage in a forest. Another, seen "alive" in a video, is a garish-pink rabbit suit, for a wearer who wants to stand out in a crowd. And in every case, I think the first wearer we imagine donning these costumes is Nick Cave himself as he comes face-to-face with the invisibility that all Black artists have faced, and with the excessive presence that also gets imposed on them -- and on other Black males, such as Trayvon Martin or Eric Garner. Cave, the "bunny" in his video, therefore takes on the classic artist's role of Everyman, generating avatars that the rest of us are invited to try on as well, as we negotiate our own private absence and presence in the culture.
Valentina Primrose, a fashion artist who identifies as a trans person of color, was moved to tears after two visits to the Cave show. Primrose recognized Cave's own strong presence in his Soundsuits, "but I also imagined myself, my whole family, a whole slew of people inside the Soundsuits. Nick Cave is not one person. He's multitudes of persons, multitudes of spirits, multitudes of embodiment."
Which led Primrose down five stories to the Guggenheim gift shop, which is offering gewgaw-covered, Cave-inspired mules by the shoe designer James Sommerfeldt. Costing as much as $ 3,500, they ask for more of a commitment than the Whitney's Hopper hat. Primrose sighed at not being able to afford them, but hardly needed such goods to stand out from the Guggenheim crowd: A wild orange headdress and faux-ermine jacket more than did the job of establishing their creative credentials.
A few blocks south of the Guggenheim, another museum shop is banking on an artist's persona. The Neue Galerie, dedicated to the first modern artists from Central Europe, is offering "an exact replica of Gustav Klimt's painting smock, circa 1903." For $ 395, you can look just like a painter that almost no one would ever recognize. But I guess if the Neue gets enough people parading through town in those smocks, Klimt will join Kahlo as yet another artist whose look has as much appeal as the work.

Valentina Primrose, far right, who visited the Cave show and Guggenheim store, prefers to craft a signature look rather than borrowing someone else's.

The 'Night Court' Reboot's Success Catches Everyone by Surprise: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The revival of the 1980s show is the most popular new sitcom in years. Even some of the people behind it are surprised by its early ratings success.
In recent years, network executives have rebooted and revived decades-old TV series at will, all in the hope of finding a born-again hit.
Classic series like "Magnum P.I.," "Murphy Brown," "The X-Files" and "Roseanne," to name just a few, have all been exhumed and brought back to life, some with the original casts, others with new ones.
It took a long while for "Night Court," a popular but not quite chart-topping 1980s sitcom, to get its shot. So far it is, somewhat inexplicably, paying off.
The first three episodes of NBC's "Night Court" revival scored the highest ratings of any new network comedy in four years. The show is averaging 6.6 million viewers, according to Nielsen, and the first episode, which premiered on Jan. 17, has drawn more than 16 million viewers when delayed and streaming viewing is included, NBC said.
While it is still early, studio executives and producers behind the revival believe the show has found its audience. But the initial results for "Night Court" -- which ran for 193 episodes from 1984 to 1992 -- have also left them a bit dazed.
"I was a combination of absolutely stunned and unbelievably thrilled" when the first ratings arrived, said Channing Dungey, the chairman of Warner Bros. Television, one of the studios behind the series.
Melissa Rauch, who stars as the judge in "Night Court" and is an executive producer of the series, said, "When I saw the numbers, I honestly thought there was a typo."
Though garnering an audience of more than six million people qualifies as a standout performance in network TV these days, that's a far cry from the sizes of audiences that used to tune in -- four decades ago or even four years ago. New network sitcoms have also had trouble breaking out of the pack in recent years as viewers have gravitated to streaming.
The new "Night Court," like the original, takes place at an after-hours Manhattan arraignment court and centers on the characters that populate it: the judge, the lawyers, the bailiffs, the stenographers, the scofflaws. The lone returning cast member is John Larroquette, reprising his role as the sharp-tongued lawyer Dan Fielding. The last time viewers saw him, he was a 45-year-old prosecutor. Now he's a 75-year-old public defense lawyer.
Mr. Larroquette, who had recently been contemplating retirement, was not sure how "Night Court" would perform. He has not watched network TV in years, he said, and had no idea what makes for a good rating point in an era of vastly diminished viewership.
"I haven't been in a sitcom in a very long time, obviously," he said.
In the show, Ms. Rauch plays the daughter of Harry Stone, the oddball judge from the original "Night Court," who was portrayed by Harry Anderson. Ms. Rauch, a former star of "The Big Bang Theory," was the one with the improbable idea of bringing the show back to life.
Ms. Rauch, who has a deal with Warner Bros., was combing through the studio's library looking for show ideas when "Night Court" struck her as a viable candidate because, she said, it offered "an evergreen set of stories with these characters and cases that just come in and out each night."
Though the new iteration takes place in 2023, it looks like a throwback. In the last two years, other successful new network sitcoms, like CBS's "Ghosts" and ABC's "Abbott Elementary," have deployed a single camera. "Night Court," like the original, uses an old-school multicamera setup, complete with a studio audience.
"If you look around the courtroom that we've constructed for 'Night Court,' it's not filled with tons of computer screens or modern trappings of life," Ms. Rauch said. "We really intentionally wanted 'Night Court' to feel like a place a bit frozen in time."
The original "Night Court" won seven Emmys, including four consecutive wins for Mr. Larroquette as best supporting actor in a comedy. After his fourth win, he withdrew himself from future consideration.
But its success had limits. Critics had a hard time warming up to it, particularly in comparison with other sitcom hits of its era, such as "The Golden Girls" and "Cheers." The Los Angeles Times once described the show "as durable as a polyester suit but just as unfashionable."
Stuart Kreisman, a former executive producer of the show, lamented in 1992, "That is our legacy -- we've always been the other show."
When "Night Court" was canceled in 1992, word came from the network at such a late hour that the show's writers did not have a chance to whip up a proper send-off. (Years later, "30 Rock" would do the honors in an episode featuring a courtroom wedding for Mr. Anderson's character.)
"Night Court" went into syndication on A&E and, in more recent years, on the obscure network Laff. But it never made it to Netflix or Hulu to help introduce it to a new generation of viewers the way "Friends" and "Seinfeld" did. Dan Rubin, an executive producer on the "Night Court" revival, said he had to resort to buying older episodes off Amazon Prime during the development process. (The original series is now available on Amazon's free streaming service, Freevee.)
Susan Rovner, the chairman of entertainment content at NBCUniversal Television, suspects that nostalgia helped "Night Court" connect with the public.
"When you ask people about 'Night Court,' they have positive memories, but they can't necessarily speak so specifically about it," she said. "And that might be part of why it's resonating. There's a warm, fuzzy feeling about it, even though they may not remember every moment of it."
Given the glut of reboots, Mr. Larroquette said that before "Night Court," the last time he had appeared in front of a television studio audience was a guest appearance on -- naturally -- the revival of "Murphy Brown" in 2018.
The original "Murphy Brown" was very much a creature of its time, and the revival awkwardly tried to place the title character headfirst into the Trump-era culture wars. It was canceled after a single season.
Mr. Larroquette said "Night Court" could be working because of its offbeat style of comedy.
"I don't mean this in a Rembrandt or a Henry Moore sculpture way, but the show was kind of timeless because it wasn't topical," he said. "It wasn't stuck in the politics of the day, or the mores of the day. It was onto itself: Is this funny? Regardless of its connection to society, and present time.
"So when you fast forward 30-odd years, you're still using that as your gauge," he continued. "Is it funny?" This article appeared in print on page B5.

Her Culture Was Suppressed for Centuries. Now It Powers Her Bestseller.

Two days after Christmas, Ann-Helén Laestadius found herself being gently pummeled by reindeer.
Taking advantage of the bluish glow that passes for daylight in Sweden’s far north at that time of year, she had left her parents’ cozy kitchen and driven to the corral where her cousin keeps his herd during winter. She was there for a photo shoot, but first, she had to help feed the animals, extracting half-frozen tufts of lichen from a mesh sack as the reindeer jostled her impatiently. Even after a close brush with the pointy end of an antler, she looked on them indulgently.
“For the Sámi,” Laestadius said, referring to the Indigenous group of which she is a member, “reindeer are not just animals. They are life.”
That lesson is at the heart of her novel, “Stolen,” which comes out in English from Scribner on Tuesday. It explains why the book’s Sámi characters perceive the killing of their reindeer as a crime not against their property, but against their people as a whole. And thanks to the book’s success, it is also a lesson that Sweden, whose colonization of the Sámi has been long and oppressive, may slowly be learning.
An Indigenous people, the Sámi, who number around 80,000, inhabit a vast territory that stretches across the Arctic areas of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia’s Kola Peninsula. For centuries, their language and culture have been forcibly suppressed by national governments that also stripped their land rights and developed industries that threatened the habitats on which their livelihoods and culture depend.
To this day, the Sámi are engaged in legal and political struggles to protect their lands from mineral and timber extraction, and their herding routes from energy projects. And although the Nordic countries are widely perceived, both abroad and at home, as progressive and egalitarian, many of the Sámi who live within their borders say they remain targets of discrimination, racism and — through their reindeer — violence.
A case in point: After the Swedish Supreme Court in 2020 granted the Sámi the exclusive right to manage hunting and fishing rights in the area of Girjas Samby, near the Norwegian border, reindeer killings (which had long plagued the community) increased markedly. It was an expression, many Sámi believe, of anger among local Swedes who resented losing their hunting rights to a people they had long denigrated. “They kill our reindeer,” Laestadius said, “because they can’t kill us.”
Born to a Sámi mother and a father who is Tornedalian, another of Sweden’s ethnic minorities, Laestadius, 51, grew up outside Kiruna, a mining city about 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Early in life, she began internalizing shame about her identity, she said. Her mother spoke Sámi with her parents and neighbors, but would switch to Swedish whenever she went into the city.
“It made me automatically start to think something is wrong,” Laestadius said of her mother’s code-switching. “ We are something wrong.”
That sense grew stronger once she started school, she said, and faced bullying and rejection from the non-Sámi children. “I started to realize that I should be quiet about who I am.”
In her 20s, Laestadius moved to Stockholm where she worked as a crime reporter for several Swedish newspapers. But gradually, as both a journalist and then an author of young adult books, she began looking back at the world in which she had grown up. Her first book, published in 2007, was about a 13-year-old girl secretly studying the Sámi language.
“Stolen,” her first adult novel, also begins with a young Sámi girl. Elsa is 9 years old when she witnesses the malicious killing of her reindeer calf. As she grows up, the trauma of that moment, coupled with other brutalities — ostracizing at school, a friend’s suicide, a police force unable or unwilling to investigate the ongoing reindeer killings — transmutes into rage.
Laestadius carried around the idea for a novel for seven years, she said, but kept herself from writing it out of concern that she didn’t have the right to tell reindeer herders’ stories since she herself did not come from a herding family. But after two of her young cousins — brothers — killed themselves, she felt she could no longer avoid writing about the impact of imposed inferiority, she said.
“Suicide is something that every Sámi family has been through,” Laestadius said. “I wanted people to know; this is what happens when you treat people like this, when they get so much hatred.”
As she began talking to herders for research, her sense of urgency grew.
“Everybody told the same story,” she said. “I could feel their sorrow and their desperation.”
When a young herder gave her copies of a hundred reports of reindeer killings that had been filed with the police without any arrests being made, Laestadius had had enough: “I wrote this book with a lot of anger.”
She also wrote it with sensitivity and insight for the subtleties of Sámi life. From the pride that Elsa takes in her gákti — the traditional, ribbon-trimmed Sámi dress — to the embarrassing way that tourists gush over her, “Stolen” illuminates a culture that many in Sweden have long ignored or reviled. Sámi words dot the text — an intentional strategy for overcoming the shame that prevented her own mother from teaching her the language. “It is my sorrow that I don’t speak Sámi,” Laestadius said. “So it became even more important for me to have it in my books.”
Although “Stolen” is fiction, some Sámi have found it a welcome depiction of their reality — including the reindeer killings that many Sámi organizations are fighting to have classified as hate crimes. “Ann-Helén depicts nuances in the culture that I’m not sure non-Sámi would pick up on,” said Åsa Larsson Blind, vice president of the Sámi Council, a nongovernmental organization that works to protect Sámi rights. “It’s quite an extraordinary talent that she can write a story about something that is quite specific to a small culture, but that is interesting to a wider audience.”
“Stolen” won Sweden’s reader-voted Book of the Year Prize in 2021, and is being adapted into a film for Netflix.
Laestadius is now part of a large community of Sámi artists, musicians and writers whose work contains political messages. “Within Sámi culture, artists have always been activists,” Larsson said. “It’s natural for them to express strong political statements through art, and it can be more powerful too, because people tend to be more open to art.”
In recent years, a number of Sámi artists, musicians and writers have gained new attention and acclaim for their work within Nordic countries. Director Amanda Kernell’s film, “Sámi Blood,” took the top prize at the 2017 Gothenburg Film Festival. Mats Jonsson’s “When We Were Sámi,” which tracks the author’s attempt to reconcile his recently discovered Sámi ancestry with his Swedish identity, became, in 2021, the first graphic novel ever nominated for the August Prize, a prestigious literary award. Artist Maret Anne Sara’s moving piece of protest art, Pile O’Sápmi, crowns the entrance to Norway’s recently inaugurated National Museum in Oslo. The Nordic Pavilion at the 2022 Venice Biennale was devoted entirely to Sámi artists.
In the eastern city of Umea, Krister Stoor, a professor of language studies who teaches “Stolen” as part of his university curriculum, has seen a major transformation in the local literary festival. “This year, there are so many Sámi authors,” he said. “Ten years ago you would have had a hard time finding one.”
Although the Church of Sweden has apologized for its role in repression against the Sámi — including by overseeing boarding schools that forcibly assimilated Sámi children — the Swedish government has not.
It is uncertain whether the recent outpouring of cultural energy and interest are affecting Swedish attitudes and policy, but there are signs of change. In December, the Swedish government agreed to return for burial the remains of 18 Sámi whose bodies had been used in the early 20th century in now-discredited race-based research, and it has promised to facilitate the repatriation of Sámi artifacts currently held in Swedish museums.
At least among some sectors of Swedish society, there is growing awareness of Sweden’s responsibility for the treatment of the Sámi. In a glowing review of “Stolen” for the newspaper Expressen, Gunilla Brodrej, a culture editor, expressed shame for once dismissing as unrealistic a television series that depicted the racism the Sámi face.
“In school, I, and even my children, learn that we Swedes have arranged everything in a very good way for the Sámi,” she said in an interview. “But when you read a book like this you realize that it’s a much darker story than we ever learned.”
Laestadius has seen some impact. Local newspapers are covering the reindeer killings more frequently, and there are signs that authorities may be paying more attention to the cases. “Usually they never come,” she said of the police, with a wry grin. “But last summer when a reindeer was killed in a little village, they sent a helicopter.”
She is still angry, however, and she still has more to reveal. In February, her latest novel will come out in Sweden. It depicts the brutal conditions at the boarding schools Sámi children were sent to, and is based on her mother’s experience.
As the noontime sun began to set, Laestadius posed for a few more pictures in the snow-clad village where her “Stolen” is set.
“Now we have the opportunity and the power to tell our story,” she said. “It is ours to tell.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Musée Picasso in Paris, home to a vast trove of its namesake’s masterworks, is offering a striped Breton shirt that makes it easy to adopt the great cubist’s signature look for a mere $70 or so.
On a webpage for the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum, in Washington, you can buy high-top sneakers covered in the “infinity net” pattern that is an artistic trademark of Yayoi Kusama, the 93-year-old Japanese art star. They cost $360, and the Hirshhorn shop has sold 44 pairs.
The gift shop at New York City’s Whitney Museum of American Art displays a $118 Hopper hat, a felt fedora that’s an almost perfect match for the one in Edward Hopper’s most famous self-portrait, which the museum owns.
If visitors are willing to spend that kind of money to dress up like a favorite artist, that’s because today’s art-loving public finds as much inspiration in creators’ personas as in the works they create.
Jennifer Heslin, director of retail operations at the Whitney, said that over her quarter century in museum marketing, she’s seen visitors become ever more interested in goods, like the museum’s Hopper hat, that give them “a connection to that creative impulse” in the great artists who act as role models.
One of the world’s many immersive “experiences” dedicated to Vincent van Gogh sets itself apart from all others with a virtual-reality component that gives the chance to be “fully immersed in the mind” of van Gogh. An immersive built around Frida Kahlo can proudly proclaim that it is “presented without reproductions of the artist’s paintings” so that it can dwell instead on “the incredible story behind the legendary artist.” It’s been popular enough to get programmed in 15 cities worldwide.
Six decades ago, Andy Warhol helped set us on this course, for good or ill, when he first made his persona count for as much as his paintings or films. The creation that truly changed the whole future of art was the living sculpture called Andy Warhol, forever updated to suit the times it was in.
There was his striped shirt borrowed from Picasso, used to create a cheerful, Pop-y version of Warhol that signaled his ambition to take the Spaniard’s place in art. Then there was the vampiric Warhol, in a biker’s leather jacket and drug user’s shades. The ’70s saw Warhol in jeans, white shirt and tie, casting off his outdated ’60s rebellion, and then in the ’80s he could be seen in shoulder pads to court the New Wave. And throughout it all that shocking platinum wig, now for sale in any costume store.
An early critic billed Warhol as the culmination of “that curious yet significant tradition in which the artist is his own work of art” — a tradition that was peaking just when Warhol came on the scene. In the early 1960s, the cutting edge did its best to dissolve all frontiers between art and life, declaring salad-making an artistic act, or wheeling a baby carriage, or in one sad case, overdosing on drugs.
Warhol conjoined art and life better than almost anyone, and that is what continues to keep him so much in the public eye. Four decades after his death, this winter he’s onstage alongside Jean-Michel Basquiat, that other larger-than-art persona, in a Broadway play and is at the heart of two other plays in Chicago, after his star turn last year in “The Andy Warhol Diaries” on Netflix. All those shows let Warhol’s artistic creations almost disappear behind the man who created them. He led us to Hopper hats and art-free Kahlo events.
Warhol clearly wasn’t the first artist to have a persona that attracted attention. The public’s interest in van Gogh was always split between his works and his life story, however little he had planned on that outcome. A host of great women artists took care to craft personas that helped them stand out from a horde of male colleagues. A few years back, a Brooklyn Museum show about Georgia O’Keeffe highlighted the signature outfits she sewed and bought and had herself photographed in. A show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art displayed all the many great photos that spread news of Kahlo’s own colorful, well-tended persona. But where the splashy images of those artists helped to pitch works that stood up fine on their own, Warhol’s endless Marilyns and Flowers and Soup Cans have come to seem more like mere pointers to their creator.
The fame of Kusama, which only seems to grow by the year, is likewise less about any actual aesthetic rewards delivered by her unending stream of dot-covered objects than about the self-declared madness that gave birth to those dots.
Kusama’s dots say “Yayoi was here” as much as they ask for the deepest of readings. Their constant repetition doesn’t work to dilute some powerful artistic message, as you could argue is the case with notable repeaters like Gerhard Richter or Richard Serra. Kusama’s repetitions, like Warhol’s, work wonders in getting her persona known far and wide. Right now, she — or at least her magnetic persona — is attracting crowds outside the Fifth Avenue window of Louis Vuitton in New York, in the form of a dot-painting robot avatar, which does its work below a 10-story mural of the artist herself.
Banksy’s worldwide street art also plays a role in persona-building, which is surprising given that the Northern Hemisphere’s most popular muralist stays anonymous. But that anonymity only increases our fascination with the Man of Mystery behind the work so that in his very absence Banksy comes to matter at least as much as the pictures he puts before us.
Before we get cranky about celebrity replacing aesthetics, we might want to recognize that some of today’s best artists do fine work in Warhol’s footsteps.
Theaster Gates makes and sells individual art objects that are hard not to like, for their own sakes: lovely sculptures that explore the history and meaning of ceramics; compelling abstractions made out of urban detritus. But I’d say those only take on their full role when seen as elements — props, almost — in a larger artistic “project” that includes all the ways Gates intersects with the world, and the art world, wearing hats as urban activist, music impresario, cultural archivist … and as the bestselling object-maker whose sales fund the rest of what he gets up to. That is, what Gates does is what makes him matter; his artworks are just a small part of that.
There’s one object-making artist, in the spotlight right now in New York, whose greatest objects address the very “problem” of the artist’s presence as a persona. In his survey show at the Guggenheim Museum, Nick Cave has filled an entire fifth-floor gallery with 16 of his Soundsuits, the elaborate, gewgaw-covered onesies that are quite rightly his signature works.
One covers its wearer head to toe in twigs, permitting perfect camouflage in a forest. Another, seen “alive” in a video, is a garish-pink rabbit suit, for a wearer who wants to stand out in a crowd. And in every case, I think the first wearer we imagine donning these costumes is Cave himself as he comes face to face with the invisibility that all Black artists have faced, and with the excessive presence that also gets imposed on them — and on other Black males, such as Trayvon Martin or Eric Garner. Cave, the “bunny” in his video, therefore takes on the classic artist’s role of Everyman, generating avatars that the rest of us are invited to try on as well, as we negotiate our own private absence and presence in the culture.
Valentina Primrose, a fashion artist who identifies as a trans person of color, was moved to tears after two visits to the Cave show. Primrose recognized Cave’s own strong presence in his Soundsuits, “but I also imagined myself, my whole family, a whole slew of people inside the Soundsuits. Nick Cave is not one person. He’s multitudes of persons, multitudes of spirits, multitudes of embodiment.”
Which led Primrose down five stories to the Guggenheim gift shop, which is offering gewgaw-covered, Cave-inspired mules by shoe designer James Sommerfeldt. Costing as much as $3,500, they ask for more of a commitment than the Whitney’s Hopper hat. Primrose sighed at not being able to afford them but hardly needed such goods to stand out from the Guggenheim crowd: A wild orange headdress and faux-ermine jacket more than did the job of establishing their creative credentials.
A few blocks south of the Guggenheim, another museum shop has jumped on the persona bandwagon. The Neue Galerie, dedicated to the first modern artists from Central Europe, is offering “an exact replica of Gustav Klimt’s painting smock, circa 1903.” For $395, you can look just like a painter that almost no one would ever recognize. But I guess if the Neue gets enough people parading through town in those smocks, Klimt will join Kahlo as yet another artist whose look has as much appeal as the work.

'Avatar' Villain Has a Wholesome Day: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Stephen Lang is perhaps best known for playing the nefarious, strong and lithe Colonel Miles Quaritch in "Avatar." But if long marriages are any indicator, the stage and screen actor, 70, is more of a good guy: He and his wife, Kristina Lang, a costume designer, have been married for 43 years. They split their time between a house in the Hudson Valley and a brownstone in Harlem, which they share with one of their four children, Lucy Lang, the New York State inspector general, and her family. When the couple is in Harlem, their miniature dachshund, Ginger, "sort of a living hot water bottle," he said, comes with them.
HERE'S THE DEAL I generally wake up around 4 a.m. Part of the reason is Ginger starts shaking her ears and makes a sound that means she's ready to go out. I give her an early breakfast, then anywhere between 4 and 5 a.m., I have two cups of coffee. I have the two cups of coffee because I want all my plumbing to be in good shape for the day. The plumbing needs to be clear because, here's the deal, I'm about to go do yoga. You said you wanted me to get granular. I'm getting granular.
NONTOXIC When the yoga studios closed down for the pandemic, I put stuff in our place to do yoga, like a full-length mirror and a little space heater. I can get a 60- or 90-minute class via Zoom, although I am usually back at the studio now. When I started doing yoga it was called Bikram yoga, but we don't call it that anymore. We call it 26&2 yoga because Bikram has become a toxic word because of the person who invented it. However, the yoga process is very, very divorced from that.
CITY GUY My daughter Lucy, and her husband and children, occupy the top three floors of our brownstone -- we co-own it -- and my wife and I have the garden apartment for when we're in the city, which at various times in life can be a lot or, during the pandemic, not at all. But I'm a city guy, born and bred. I know the city. When I finish my yoga, we'll probably have some kind of event we're going to or maybe the theater. But if not, I'll take a long walk. If you're a New Yorker, you know that walking is basically the best mode of transportation aside from the train.
THE FAMILY BENCH My favorite part of New York is Central Park, so I love to go down there and take a good walk all around. I could traverse the entire park, and I've done it many times. I often wind up on 72nd Street on the East Side where we have a bench we call Terry's bench. My mother bought the bench and dedicated it to my father. When you give money, maybe to the conservancy, you get a plaque on a bench. I like to go sit there and have a little conversation with my mom. She died in 2008. If you come along and someone is sitting on what you consider your bench, you can't really say, "Excuse me, that's my bench, get off it." Or you could say that, but they're New Yorkers. They would look at you and say, "Sit on this, pal."
THE BUS If I don't feel like walking all the way back across the park, I might take the M10 bus back up to Central Park West. I'm glad the M10 is still there. I believe several years ago, they were going to cut back on its service but all the riders rose up in protest. Before the yoga studio got shut down, I'd take the M10 there for the 5:30 a.m. class, to 72nd between Columbus and Amsterdam. I enjoy riding the bus in New York City tremendously, especially that time of day when it's quiet and the bus driver a lot of times will embrace his inner NASCAR driver and you will see all the animals, like raccoons, darting back into the park after they've been out all night trash hunting. Rats? Rats are a whole other thing.
MEMORY MUSCLE I used to memorize something every day. "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" by Robert Browning is one of the most beautiful pieces of poetry, and it's also a cautionary tale about rats, speaking of rats. My head is too crammed now to memorize something every day. I memorize what I need to memorize for work. But now I go through some of the old stuff. I used to know a lot of Shakespeare, and you've got to kind of keep working on it to make sure it stays in your brain.
RITUALIZED When you talk to actors, so much of what we do could be considered routine, but it's actually ritual. They're ceremonial things that kind of empower us to get the necessary result. In Jane Lynch's Routine, I read that she eats two peanut butter cups before a performance, then at intermission she eats two more. I understand there's a certain energy jolt that can result from that, but at the same time, it's ritualized behavior. And it struck me as absolutely normal, because all the stuff I do is ritualized, whether it be yoga or karate or weight lifting. It brings about a desired state of preparedness, even if it's just a question of being in a good emotional and mental state.
ON SLEEP I can take a nap anywhere. It can be six minutes. I think they're restorative. I think they recalibrate you. You always wake up renewed and refreshed. For some reason Americans, we're ashamed of napping. You know when you call someone and you can kind of tell you woke them up and they'll go, "No, no, no, I wasn't sleeping." And you want to say, "Yes, you were, and it's good. It's good to sleep during the day." I've been a believer in naps since college. This is not something I've adopted since I've gotten older.
DINNER PARTY Everyone in my family is a good cook. I'm certainly not the best among them. Both our sons live in L.A. -- they're both in the movie business as well -- but our daughters are local, and they could come over for dinner with their families, or maybe some friends or extended family will come. We're always feeding people. I remember one Thanksgiving, I didn't know half the people at our friggin' table.
ACADEMY DUTIES Then I would probably try to get the TV working and end up calling my son-in-law to say, "Can you please get this going for me so we can watch some Netflix?" We try to watch all the movies we have to watch so I can vote for the Oscars with some integrity rather than voting for movies I've acted in. Possibly the people who have come for dinner will be there but hopefully not because I've got to put my pajamas on. Remember, I'm getting up at 4 a.m.

Where Trauma Is Always a Hot Ticket: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Dramas about couples ("Cat Person") and families ("A Thousand and One") tackle complex lives; documentaries on Judy Blume and Nikki Giovanni entertain.
For nearly 40 years, intrepid movie lovers have traveled to Park City, Utah, to partake in that fascinating continuing experiment called the Sundance Film Festival. Having gone virtual in 2021 and 2022 because of the pandemic, the event has resumed in-person screenings to go along with its online offerings. And certainly it's seemed like business again as usual as thousands of attendees tramped through the snow to watch good and less-so movies, including many that focus on the same ideological debates, political fights, liberation struggles and existential questions attendees face back home. (The festival ends Sunday.)
One of the great, foundational truths about the festival is that it -- like its parent organization, the Sundance Institute -- remains the pre-eminent showcase for off-Hollywood American movies even as it has retained deep, mutually beneficial ties to the commercial mainstream. That may seem paradoxical, but it's no more so than the movies themselves, a commercial form that depends on an alchemical combination of art and money, vision and hustle. Sundance is, after all, a talisman for film independence that was founded by a major film star, Robert Redford, in 1981 -- the very same year he won the best directing Oscar for "Ordinary People," his directorial debut about a traumatized upper-middle-class white family.
Whether "Ordinary People" set the mood or not, trauma is an enduring topic at the festival, although broken families are only part of the larger, careful mix at Sundance in any given year, this one included. Democracy and its threats have also been on the agenda for the 2023 edition alongside free speech, sexual identity, reproductive rights, bad men and seriously bad vibes. It's always dubious to draw zeitgeist-y conclusions amid all the variables, including institutional mandates, programmer taste, back-room politicking and the basic fact that it can be years between a movie's conception and its premiere. Yet that has rarely stopped any critic and I can confidently assert that, as a culture, we are bummed -- but also hopeful!
To judge from some of the hottest, most talked-up titles this year, it seems clear that heterosexual relationships -- or at least movies about them -- have entered a new and particularly fractious phase. (Romance may not be dead, but it's no wonder romantic movies, especially comedies, nearly are.) Exhibit No. 1 is "Cat Person," a slick adaptation of the Kristen Roupenian short story that became a sensation when it was published in The New Yorker in 2017. As in the story, the movie tracks the messy, creepy relationship that develops between a young college student, Margot (Emilia Jones), and an older guy, Robert (Nicholas Braun), after their flirtatious texting takes a sharp turn into sweaty, fleshy reality.
Reality, though, proves tricky, slippery terrain in the screen adaptation, which like several other female-driven festival titles this year ("Eileen," "Sometimes I Think About Dying") uses a woman's fantasies to complicated, at times uneasy effect. In Roupenian's original story, Margot goes out with Robert but also wonders whether he poses a threat. She sleeps with him; it gets (very) weird. Roupenian artfully, at times comically marshals Margot's hesitation to create tension and suspense in a story that deals with power, sexual consent, gender norms, the limits of knowledge and that durable narrative theme: female paranoia.
Directed by Susanna Fogel from a script by Michelle Ashford, "Cat Person" changes the original story's dynamic and blunts its subtleties by visually staging Margot's hesitations. At one point, for instance, while she and Robert are in his car on their first date, he abruptly starts strangling Margot, only for the scene to cut back to them just awkwardly driving and talking. The filmmakers teasingly play with women's fears about men -- is it all in her head? -- and it's not for nothing that one of the first sounds in "Cat Person" is of a woman screaming, which emanates from a cheesy old trailer playing at the movie theater where Margot works.
Like many indies, "Cat Person" opens stronger than it closes, partly because it uses the spectacle of violence to tie up its loose, provocative ends. That's also the case with the smoothly seductive "Fair Play," yet another addition to #MeToo cinema. (It's been snapped up by Netflix.) Written and directed by Chloe Domont, this effective, slow-boiling drama centers on Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke (Alden Ehrenreich), whose happiness is undone after she receives a promotion at the brokerage firm where they both work. She becomes his boss and soon they become each other's adversaries, a breakdown in relations that reaches a punishing climax (for them and for us) with a succession of exceedingly brutal acts.
The stakes are grimmer and considerably more persuasive in "A Thousand and One," the poignant feature debut of A.V. Rockwell about a young ex-con trying to keep her tiny family together. Set in New York in the mid-1990s, this drama follows Inez (a terrific Teyana Taylor) from jail to Harlem as she struggles to find (and hold onto) an affordable apartment in a fast-changing neighborhood while landing a decent-paying job and rekindling an affair with an old boyfriend. With emotional delicacy and a lightly expressionistic visual style, Rockwell brings both Inez and New York to life, skillfully setting one woman's hardscrabble personal story against a larger political backdrop. Rockwell is the real deal; keep an eye on her.
Rudolph Giuliani, who was New York's mayor from 1994 to 2001, makes a splashy, politically charged cameo in both "A Thousand and One" and the documentary "The Stroll." Directed by Kristen Lovell and Zackary Drucker, "The Stroll" is a diverting, often touching look back at New York's meatpacking district before it was gentrified into a soulless playground for the wealthy. Long before the days when "Sex and the City," the luxury emporiums and the Whitney all moved downtown, the area was where transgender prostitutes -- including Lovell -- fashioned a community while turning tricks, a story that the filmmakers tell with humor, wryness, well-earned tears, some smartly deployed archival material and numerous talking-head interviews.
The documentary sections at Sundance are often where you find some of the festival's consistently strongest work, and this year was no exception. There's a natural double bill to be had with "Judy Blume Forever" and "Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project," each of which provide insightful, entertaining career overviews of wonderfully scrappy writers. Both "Judy Blume" (directed by Davina Pardo and Leah Wolchok) and "Nikki Giovanni" (Joe Brewster and Michèle Stephenson) track their subjects across their respective event-filled lives as a children's book author and as a poet, pausing on their career triumphs, revisiting personal milestones and surveying political battles with original interviews, great archival material and some animated flourishes.
Both of these documentaries, like most of the nonfiction work I saw at this year's Sundance, were more intellectually engaging than formally revelatory, even with their visual flights of fancy. One of the nice things about documentaries, though, is that a movie can grab hold of you simply through the power of its subject. That's true of "Bad Press," an absorbing, eye-opening look at the fight for a free and open press in the Muscogee (Creek) Nation directed by Rebecca Landsberry-Baker and Joe Peeler. That's also the case with "Victim/Suspect," Nancy Schwartzman's blood-boiler about a reporter investigating cases in which women who, after reporting their sexual assault to the police, are accused of lying, then arrested and prosecuted.
Despite its popularity and generally positive press, Sundance has often been the target of a certain amount of mockery, both good-natured and meanspirited. Its earlier years are still, fondly and not, branded as its granola period, a characterization that speaks to the kinds of modest, regionally minded movies that the festival often presented. To a degree, some of the gibes also reflected some observers' feelings about Redford, whose earnestness has long made him a very big and obviously irresistible target (when he's not dazzling everyone with his stardom). The mockery continued even as Sundance's imprint on the industry greatly expanded -- partly because it expanded. Steven Soderbergh broke there, and so did Dee Rees.
This year, I didn't hear any jokes about Redford or the experiment in community and storytelling that he created so many years ago. More instructively, I didn't even hear many complaints about the lineup, which was solid if not exceptional, and chock-full of fine, good and very good movies, most of which will land at your local theater or, more likely, on one of your streaming platforms. After several years of being away from the festival and so much bad and bleak news about the industry, and despite the usual logistic complaints about the festival, I think that a lot of us were simply grateful to be back in Park City, watching movies, discovering talent, finding new ideas and visiting other worlds. I know that I was.

Full text: Known for dazzling virtuosity, Wang faces a new challenge in a three-and-a-half-hour Rachmaninoff marathon at Carnegie Hall.
PHILADELPHIA -- The star pianist Yuja Wang, fresh out of rehearsal on Tuesday with the Philadelphia Orchestra, threw her arms into the air and let out a nervous laugh.
"We survived," she said inside a dressing room stocked with dark chocolate, granola bars, a bear-shaped bottle of honey and a bag of lemons.
Wang, 35, was a few days from one of the most herculean concerts of her career: a three-and-a-half-hour marathon of Rachmaninoff's four piano concertos and "Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini" at Carnegie Hall on Saturday, a virtually unheard-of undertaking. She was excited but also a bit anxious as she imagined what was coming -- the rushed rehearsals, the mammoth program and playing before an audience that will include some of her closest friends and mentors.
"I have no idea what the hell I'm doing," she said. "I'm also having the same feeling as everyone else: Let's see where this kamikaze run is going to go. I can't even control it, so I'm just going to go with the flow."
Wang has made a career out of dazzling displays of virtuosity, including in the works she will perform this weekend. But taking on these Rachmaninoff pieces together -- more than 400 pages of music, including some of the most vexing piano passages in the repertory -- poses a new test.
To prepare, Wang has reined in aspects of her famously flamboyant lifestyle, cutting back on drinking and partying so she can get eight hours of sleep a night. She has largely avoided intense solo practice in recent days, spending an hour or two a day on lighter fare like Johann Strauss waltzes. And she has tried to inhabit Rachmaninoff's world, setting aside time to reflect on the love, loneliness and hope in his art.
"All of it is imbued in his language," she said. "You just play his music, and it just comes out."
Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the Philadelphia Orchestra's music director, who is leading the Carnegie concert, likened the effort to climbing Mount Everest. (Olympic-style medals, emblazoned with grand pianos, will be handed out to Wang, Nézet-Séguin and the players at the conclusion of Saturday's marathon.)
"It's insane for everyone," he said. "It's possible only when people know each other so well. And that's the case between Yuja and me and this orchestra."
Nézet-Séguin recalled thinking, "OK, that's exactly the person made for that music" when Wang performed Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto with the orchestra in 2013, one of their early collaborations. He described her as the "ideal Rachmaninoff pianist," saying she had honed a powerful yet airy style.
"With her there is never, never, ever a hint of a harsh or hard sound," he said. "It's always beautiful, it's always phrased, it's always very free." (Nézet-Séguin will also conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra in a series of Rachmaninoff performances with Wang at the ensemble's home to celebrate the composer's 150th birthday.)
Wang, who was born in China, has long felt a connection to Rachmaninoff's music. As a child, she was drawn to the lyricism of his preludes for piano, even as she followed a strict conservatory regimen of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven.
It was not until she enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, at 15, that she began intensely studying Rachmaninoff's works, including his piano concertos and the "Rhapsody." She was drawn to the "noble and pure" sound of the composer's own recordings, she said, and to the vulnerability of his music.
"It's like reading Russian literature," she said. "It's really enjoyable, even though it's long, because it's very loquacious."
The pianist and educator Gary Graffman, who taught Wang at Curtis, said it was quickly apparent that she intuitively understood the composer's style. Her technical mastery of the pieces, which demand breakneck finger work and stunts like keyboard-sweeping glissandos, was exceptional, he said. But it was the sensitivity of her interpretations that awed him.
"She ate it up," he said. "She's undaunted by everything."
After her graduation from Curtis, in 2008, she quickly became one of classical music's most in-demand stars. She earned praise from critics for her fiery interpretations of works by Russians like Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev. And she was celebrated by audiences for her virtuoso takes on well-known pieces, including the Rondo alla Turca from Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 11.
She also attracted attention for her vivid sartorial choices, performing war horses in skintight dresses and Jimmy Choo heels. And her love of encores captivated the public; at a recital in London last year, she performed 10. (A video of one favorite, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's "Flight of the Bumblebee," has garnered more than 8.3 million views on YouTube.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
During the early days of the pandemic, Wang took a break from piano, spending time watching Netflix, taking walks in Central Park and learning to master household tasks that she, as a prodigy, had long neglected, like cooking and laundry.
But she returned to the stage in May 2021 with Rachmaninoff, performing his Piano Concerto No. 2 in London with the conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, a longtime friend and mentor.
"Imagine," she said of the experience, "that was like, 'Oh, OK, I see the power of music!"'
As cultural life sprang back, Wang began thinking about new challenges. She was eager to create an experience that would test the attention span of audiences in the TikTok era. She recalled listening to Wagner's "Ring" as a student at Curtis for hours on end and walking away with new admiration for "a past human being's work and their effort and what they're trying to express."
Saturday's concert, she said, is "going to be a stamina test for the audience as well."
The Rachmaninoff marathon also had a virtuosic appeal for Wang, an inveterate thrill-seeker who has learned to Jet Ski and dabbled in cryotherapy. She said that performing the works in one go gave her "lots of ego": "It's like, Yes, I can play them!" She added that she would like to perform the program again, perhaps in Los Angeles or China. (She recently spread out the concertos over multiple programs with the Orlando Philharmonic, and will do the same, adding the "Rhapsody," with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in February.)
Thomas said that Wang sometimes asked composer friends to revise piano works written for her -- including ones by him -- so that they were more demanding. He likened her to a racehorse.
"She wants to run; she wants to show everything she can do," he said. "And at the same time, she's a very, very respectful and curious musical intelligence."
No artist has ever played all five of these Rachmaninoff works in a single concert at Carnegie, which is marketing the performance as a "once-in-a-lifetime" experience. Rachmaninoff, who long admired the Philadelphia Orchestra, performed the first three of his piano concertos with the ensemble under Eugene Ormandy there in 1939. Vladimir Ashkenazy played all four concertos on four consecutive nights with the London Symphony Orchestra and the conductor Daniel Barenboim at the hall in 1968.
Clive Gillinson, Carnegie's executive and artistic director, said few artists had the stamina, focus, intensity and emotional engagement to pull off such a feat.
"There have been occasions when artists do marathons and you feel it's about showing off," he said. "This 100 percent is not. That is not who Yuja is."
During rehearsals this week in Philadelphia, Wang seemed confident even as she fretted about the difficulty of sounding fresh in pieces that are well known. She said that at the height of her mastery of a piece, the music emerges so naturally that she feels as if she had composed it.
And she reminisced about the energy she had in her 20s, when she said she could stay out late drinking and still perform at 11 the next morning. But now, she added, she feels a more profound connection with the music, especially since last year, when she began dating the conductor Klaus Mäkelä. (She recently took him to meet Graffman, her teacher, who offered his approval.)
"When the love part is going well," she said, "this music has a deeper meaning than just a release of emotions."
As Nézet-Séguin worked to lighten the sound of the orchestra in the "Rhapsody" to match Wang's tone, she flipped through the score on an iPad and ran her fingers silently over the keys, practicing thorny passages.
At the end of the rehearsal, he stopped to speak with her.
"You're my hero," Nézet-Séguin said, embracing her. Wang smiled and laughed, and then turned back to the score.

The British Aren't Alone in Royal Drama: [Style Desk]

Full text: Dysfunction and disorder are hardly restricted to the House of Windsor. Here's a look at some of the world's other messy monarchies.
It is fair to say the world knows a great deal more about the Duke of Sussex' penis than it did a month ago, not to mention novel uses for Elizabeth Arden cream.
Since the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the accession of King Charles III in September, the Firm -- as the British royal family is unofficially known -- hasn't just been grappling with a major management reshuffle. In a Netflix series and his splashy new memoir, Prince Harry has been lobbing a near constant stream of bombshell revelations into the public domain, airing intimate personal details as well as allegations of treachery and familial betrayal afoot behind palace doors in the House of Windsor.
But Britain doesn't have a monopoly on royal dirty laundry. Behold, four other messy monarchies that have also been engaged lately with dysfunction, disorder and high drama of their own.
Norway
There were waves in Norway last November when Princess Martha Louise relinquished royal duties to focus on her alternative medicine business with her fiancé, Durek Verrett, a celebrity shaman whose clients have included Selma Blair and Nina Dobrev. It was the latest in a series of controversies stemming from the princess' relationship with Mr. Verrett, who suggested in his 2019 book, "Spirit Hacking," that cancer was a choice. The self-described "sixth-generation shaman" also sells a "Spirit Optimizer" medallion on his website that he claims helped him recover from Covid-19. For her part, Martha Louise has frequently suggested that she can communicate with animals and angels.
Denmark
There has been much talk in Britain in recent years about a potential slimming down of the monarchy that would cut the number of working royals. In September, the Danes actually did it.
Queen Margrethe II of Denmark announced that she had "discontinued" royal titles for the children of her second son, Prince Joachim, meaning that her grandchildren in that line -- Nikolai, 23; Felix, 20; Henrik, 13; and Athena, 10 -- would not be princes or princesses. She ruffled some familial feathers in the process, sparking a tit-for-tat saga that played out in the Danish news media.
"We are all very sad," Prince Joachim told the Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet. "It's never fun to see your children being mistreated like that. They have been put in a situation they do not understand." The prince said he had been given only five days to tell his children. His eldest son, Nikolai, added: "We are in shock at this decision. I am very confused as to why it has to happen like this."
In October, the queen admitted that she had "underestimated" the impact of her choice but said her decision had been "a long time coming" and was made in line with her values as a "queen, mother and grandmother."
"It is my duty and my desire as queen to ensure that the monarchy always shapes itself in keeping with the times," she said in a statement. "Sometimes, this means that difficult decisions must be made, and it will always be difficult to find the right moment."
Thailand
King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand is not a conventional ruler, at least by contemporary standards. The king, who was officially crowned in 2019, two and a half years after acceding to the throne upon his father's death, has been married four times and has publicly courted untold mistresses. When he was crown prince, he appointed his pet poodle Foo Foo to the role of air chief marshal and held four days of Buddhist funeral rites when the poodle died in 2015, according to The Guardian. Then there is the 70-year-old king's fondness for wearing crop tops and transfer tattoos, which he has worn on numerous promenades during the pandemic in Germany, where he spends most of his time.
Belly-baring vests have become the garment of choice for many young Thai pro-democracy protesters at rallies in recent years. Their demands include limiting the powers of a king who has become the richest monarch in the world, partly by amassing personal control of an estimated $ 43 billion in royal assets in 2018 that were historically overseen by an agency meant to manage the money for the benefit of the Thai people.
Spain
In May of last year, Juan Carlos, the former king of Spain, returned to Spanish soil for the first time in almost two years, prompting headlines across the country he had ruled for nearly four decades.
Juan Carlos, who abdicated in 2014, moved to Abu Dhabi in 2020 after fraud investigators alleged that he had received about $ 100 million in kickbacks in connection with a high-speed-rail contract in Saudi Arabia that was awarded to a Spanish consortium. Swiss prosecutors dropped the case, but it was far from the first controversy to tarnish a monarch known for his lavish lifestyle -- including an elephant-hunting trip that took place in the midst of the financial crisis -- and a string of extramarital affairs. His predilection for murky business dealings -- one shared by his younger daughter's husband -- has tainted public view of the Spanish monarchy, despite the best efforts of the current king, Felipe VI; his wife, Queen Letizia; and their two teenage daughters.
After last being seen together in public in September, at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth, the two Spanish kings -- father and son -- both attended the funeral of Constantine II, the last king of Greece, on Monday.

Putin's War Breathes New Life Into a Cold War Symbol of Freedom: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a news network originally set up as a C.I.A. operation early in the Cold War, is experiencing a renaissance and making a case for its independence.
Anyone who didn't live through the Cold War might find the Portuguese Netflix spy thriller series "Glória" improbable.
Deep in the Portuguese countryside, in the tiny village of Glória, a complex radio transmission operation run by Portuguese and American engineers springs up in the 1950s, a branch of a Munich-based news organization called Radio Free Europe.
It broadcasts news and anti-communist messages in languages of various Soviet republics, but, in the show and in real life, that's only part of its early mission: It's also a C.I.A. front.
Until 1971, Radio Free Europe was a covert U.S. intelligence operation seeking to penetrate the Iron Curtain and foment anti-communist dissent in what was then Czechoslovakia, in Poland and elsewhere.
The C.I.A. stopped funding Radio Free Europe when its operation was revealed. Since then, the news organization has been funded by the United States Congress and has had editorial independence.
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty -- or RFE/RL -- now barely resembles its historical predecessor, as dramatized in "Glória," but it is still very much pursuing its mission of fact-based journalism by local reporters, in local languages for local audiences across the former Soviet sphere and Central Asia.
The organization is now based in Prague instead of Munich, and is growing, opening new offices this month in Riga, Latvia, to host a big part of its Russia-focused staff.
These days, RFE/RL is only partly a radio broadcaster, although in some regions, the airwaves are still how people access it. The majority of its Russian-language audience finds its reporting online, especially through social-media platforms.
At the Prague offices, high gates, tight security checks and U.S. flags waving up front leave visitors little doubt that they are entering a building with American ties.
But this great gray marble-and-concrete cube -- just up a hill from where Franz Kafka is buried -- holds a modern newsroom that reaches millions of people each week.
The outlet says it draws an average of 40 million people weekly through its programs and channels, broadcasting in 27 languages and 23 countries "where media freedom is restricted, or where a professional press has not fully developed."
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February both shook up Radio Free Europe's operations and highlighted its mission's importance. Within days of the invasion, the organization suspended its operations in Russia. It had already faced years of growing pressure from Moscow and evacuated most staff to Prague and other offices even before the war broke out.
Jamie Fly, the broadcaster's president and chief executive, has long been in firefighting mode.
"The challenge we're facing now, and the invasion of Ukraine, is just the latest iteration," Mr. Fly said in an interview late last year. "We are increasingly getting pressure when we're operating in these environments, and in some cases, we're getting pushed out of countries. That's always been a challenge for us."
Strictures in Taliban-led Afghanistan and authoritarian Belarus are among the broadcaster's other severe challenges.
According the RFE/RL, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought in new audiences, despite the fact that its engineers have to work constantly to get ahead of censors by finding new ways to circumvent prohibitions in Russia and elsewhere.
In the first week of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, traffic to RFE/RL websites almost tripled to nearly 70 million, compared with the same week in 2021, the organization said. More than half of that traffic came from Russia and Ukraine.
Those gains have stabilized since then. From the start of the war through the end of 2022, viewership of Current Time, RFE/RL's flagship Russian-language channel, more than tripled on Facebook and more than quadrupled on YouTube, where it remains accessible within Russia, according to RFE/RL.
The broadcaster's work in Central Asian countries like Kyrgyzstan has been impactful, especially in uncovering corruption. The local network was blocked last year by the Kyrgyz government on accusations that it breached a "fake news" law. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty rejected the claims and, as it did in Russia, encouraged its audience to use VPNs to continue following its journalism.
And while its coverage of the war in Ukraine is a crucial part of its offerings, the organization's most distinctive service is its region-specific programs broadcast in the local vernacular, including those focusing on Russian areas like Chechnya and Tatarstan.
This approach -- even for languages spoken only by small populations -- has long been a key feature of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty operations.
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, a former president of Estonia who worked for the broadcaster in Munich from 1984 to 1993, said that reaching those audiences with objective, quality news, in their own languages, was particularly vital.
"RFE/RL's role is most important in providing objective information in the native language -- and is the same role it had 30 years ago," he said in a phone interview last week.
He added that this mission became more critical for audiences without the many information outlets that the Russian-speaking world has. "There are limited sources of quality information for others, and being able to hear quality news reporting in your own language is important," he said.
And, as in Mr. Ilves's time at the organization, its 21st-century incarnation is a kind of Noah's ark for journalists and émigrés from a vast region undergoing another period of epochal change.
On March 6, 10 days after Russia invaded Ukraine, RFE/RL announced it would suspend its Moscow operations after the local authorities began bankruptcy proceedings against it, citing millions of dollars in unpaid fines over the organization's refusal to comply with a 2021 order to label itself and some of its staff as foreign agents.
"We are nobody's agent, and we considered -- and continue to consider -- this labeling demand to be censorship, an attempt to interfere in editorial policy," Andrei Shary, director of RFE/RL's Russian Service, said at the time.
Mr. Shary, who describes himself as a "proud Russian," has made a home in Prague, as have some of his other Russian colleagues.
Mr. Fly, the chief executive, thinks Mr. Shary would most likely be jailed if he returned to Russia. It's a reality Mr. Shary confronts with stoicism, even though, he says, "I'll probably never get to see my mother alive again."
Some in the younger generation of journalists who left the Moscow bureau feel relief at having relocated safely before the invasion, avoiding the panic of friends who fled overnight.
Anastasia Tishchenko, 29, a human-rights reporter, said she struggled with the decision to relocate to the broadcaster's office in Prague in 2021. It was a time when "you could feel some kind of danger" because of Russian pressure on the network, she said. "But you still didn't see anything specifically dangerous to you."
"Now I think that it's one of the best decisions in my life," she said in an interview, adding, "All of my friends who are well-educated, if they had opportunities, they escaped, living in Germany, Turkey, Portugal -- but not in Russia."
Ms. Tishchenko's heartbreak has been that she has had a falling out with her parents over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Her parents, who were born in Ukraine, believe the Kremlin's version of events -- that Russia is conducting a liberation operation fighting against an oppressive government in Kyiv, and winning. It is a divide that is playing out among countless families.
She said she didn't know if she would ever be able to go home to Russia and tried instead to focus on her work in Prague as part of a supportive community of people like her.
"To dream about one day going home, to walk on the streets I grew up in, to play with my sister's child, that's just a dream," she said.

Murdoch Backtracks On Merger: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rupert Murdoch has halted his plans to combine the two parts of his media empire.
News Corp, one of Mr. Murdoch's media companies, said in a statement on Tuesday that he had determined that combining it and the Fox Corporation was "not optimal for shareholders of News Corp and Fox at this time."
The boards of both media companies disclosed in October that Mr. Murdoch had proposed reuniting the two companies, nearly 10 years after they split up.
Both Fox and News Corp established independent committees of their boards to evaluate a possible deal. But the prospect faced significant investor pushback.
The deal, if it had gone through, would have put a collection of news and entertainment assets including Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the Fox broadcasting network and TMZ under the same corporate umbrella. When it was initially proposed, Mr. Murdoch was said to be interested in the potential for cost savings and the possibility of integrating some of the companies.
Since the companies split, the media industry has gone through a wave of consolidation to compete with streaming giants like Netflix and combat the decline of the traditional TV business.
"Scale is important," Lachlan Murdoch, the chief executive of Fox and Rupert Murdoch's elder son, said in November. "Scale lends flexibility in many ways."
But executives and investors had significant questions about the rationale of the deal. When Rupert Murdoch initially separated the two companies, he argued that Fox's TV and movie business and News Corp's digital media business were better off separate. Lachlan Murdoch had told investors in 2019 that the companies would not reunite.
Some investors questioned whether the deal would equally benefit both companies given News Corp's valuable assets, like its sizable real estate business. Some also questioned whether Rupert Murdoch's interests were more aligned with Fox, in which he owns a larger share than in News Corp.
In November, the activist investor Irenic Capital Management sent a letter to News Corp's special committee questioning whether merging with Fox was a better alternative than other deals, like selling News Corp's real estate business. Irenic owns about 2 percent of News Corp's Class B shares. Those shares confer stronger voting rights than the more numerous Class A shares.
Shortly after, one of News Corp's largest shareholders, T. Rowe Price, said in an interview with The New York Times that the proposed merger would probably undervalue News Corp, which it believed was trading for less than the company was worth.
Further complicating matters was the divergent performance of each company's stock price -- News Corp jumping about 26 percent while Fox inched up about 3 percent -- since Mr. Murdoch's proposal became public. His initial plan would have divided ownership among stockholders based on the market value of each company, but it did not specify how it would be divided.
The proposal raised questions about what it would mean for succession at the companies, with many believing a merger would give Lachlan, his father's chosen heir, expanded power. Mr. Murdoch's other son, James, wrote letters to the News Corp and Fox boards raising questions about the deal. It is unclear what those objections were.
A spokesman for Rupert Murdoch did not have additional comment.
The Murdoch Family Trust, which Rupert Murdoch controls with his eldest children, commands roughly 40 percent of the vote at both Fox and News Corp through its Class B shares. Any deal would have required the approval of a majority of investors who are not part of the Murdoch trust.
The two special committees for News Corp and Fox Corp have been dissolved, News Corp said in its statement. Both committees had made progress toward a merger in recent weeks when an outside firm offered to acquire a major part of News Corp, according to two people with knowledge of the move.
The CoStar Group, a provider of data and marketing services to the commercial real estate industry, recently informed News Corp that it was interested in acquiring the company's stake in the digital real estate business Move at a valuation of more than $ 3 billion, the people said. After the talks with CoStar got serious, News Corp and Fox decided to put the merger talks on pause to await the outcome of negotiations with CoStar.
A spokesman for CoStar said the company continually evaluated opportunities for mergers and acquisitions, declining to comment on potential discussions with News Corp.
Fox is facing further challenges beyond its halted merger attempt. Fox Corporation and Fox News are being sued for $ 1.6 billion by Dominion Voting Systems in a defamation case over the network's promotion of falsehoods and conspiracy theories about voter fraud in the 2020 election. Mr. Murdoch was deposed by Dominion lawyers last week, and the judge in the case has set a trial date for April.
Fox has argued that its actions were protected under the First Amendment and covered newsworthy statements made by former President Donald J. Trump and his allies.
In an email on Tuesday to News Corp staff, Mr. Thomson said the withdrawal of the merger proposal would have no impact on current operations.
"We must focus steadfastly on creating the premium publishing, news, entertainment, intelligence and real estate products that were the catalyst for our record profits in the past two fiscal years," he said.

Are People Who Left Their Jobs in 2022 Still Happy?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Last summer we shared stories of people who were part of 2022's surge in quitting. Months later, we asked them if they were still glad they switched gears.
Calling It Quits is a series about the current culture of quitting.
Last summer we asked readers who had quit their jobs to share how their decision affected their lives. We heard from people who carved out more time for family, sought out less hectic schedules that better suited their physical and mental health and worked through financial challenges.
As Americans continue to quit their jobs in record numbers despite soaring inflation, we reconnected with six of those readers to see if they still felt happy about their decisions -- and if the United States' current economic health had changed their calculus.
Ana del Rocío
Ana del Rocío, a single mother, quit her job as executive director of a nonprofit group, Oregon Futures Lab, on Dec. 31, 2021. She wanted to spend more time with her sons, Tupac, 10, and Inti, 7, in their Portland, Ore., home. But Ms. del Rocío, 36, knew the experiment had an expiration date: Her retirement savings were likely to run out before the end of 2022.
Where is she now? Ms. del Rocío returned to the work force in September 2022, serving as chief of staff for her sister Andrea Valderrama, the Democratic state representative in Oregon's 47th District. Then, after the New Year, Ms. del Rocío made the decision to seek office herself. She is running for commissioner of District 3 in Multnomah County, the most populous in Oregon.
Her decision was solidified on Christmas Day, when, on the car ride back from her sister's home, she and her sons saw a family setting up a tent on the side of an icy road.
"I realized, yes, I have fully committed myself to being their mother, that's what drives me, that's what I want to do with my time, but I'm not raising my children in a vacuum," Ms. del Rocío said. "I needed to be able to tell them, actually, this is not OK. And this is what mommy is going to do about it."
Was quitting worth it? Ms. del Rocío doesn't think she would be in the right head space to pursue public office if not for her nearly 10-month hiatus from work, during which, she said, she developed more healthy relationships with her children and overcame burnout.
Ms. del Rocío did deplete her retirement savings, but she's hopeful that serving office will benefit both her family and her possible constituents. "It's very much an extension of my mothering. Raising children for the world, and raising the world for the children, those two things very much go together for me," Ms. del Rocío said.
Natalie Hanson
After quitting her job as a local newspaper reporter in Chico, Calif., in June 2021, Natalie Hanson, 26, took a similar role at a paper in Oakland -- and then quit again. In May 2022 she started as a reporter for Courthouse News Service, but anticipated needing to move by the end of the year because of rising rent.
Where is she now? Ms. Hanson did end up moving, from downtown Oakland to a cheaper and larger apartment in East Oakland, where she now lives with her partner, dog and cat. She said she was saving at least $ 500 in monthly rent. "Rental prices have started to fluctuate in the Bay Area, depending on where you live," Ms. Hanson said.
Ms. Hanson is also writing freelance articles for local newspapers to supplement her income with Courthouse News Service.
Was quitting worth it? Ms. Hanson's initial quitting spawned a cascade of major life decisions, ultimately leading her to a place of satisfaction. "I'm pretty surprised that I've been able to make it work, living in such an expensive place, but also such a beautiful place," Ms. Hanson said. "You have to be really creative."
Jim Walker
Jim Walker, 53, had spent his life working in churches but changed course when the pandemic shut down his church. He left his job as a pastor and became a freelance tour guide, spending much of his time on the road exploring new places.
Where is he now? Mr. Walker continues to enjoy the freedom afforded by a freelancer's schedule, but is considering taking on longer-term roles with larger companies for more pay. As much as he finds meaning in the work, he conceded that this phase of his life might end at some point. "I don't know if you can live on the road forever," he said. "Have I enjoyed it this past year? Heck, yeah. Does it fit me really well? Obviously, yeah, it's really good. But maybe 10 years from now, I don't know if I'll still be doing this. It's hard to say."
Was quitting worth it? Mr. Walker acknowledges the privilege that allows him to make this lifestyle work -- he lives at his brother's home and his only major expenses are his health insurance, car insurance and cellphone bill. But he feels more fulfilled in his work than ever. "I wish I had done this to begin with, because it's the kind of thing that works with my personality really well," he said. "I'm like a fish in water."
Rachel Sobel
Rachel Sobel, 53, left her job in Chicago as a communications director for a health insurance company in February 2022. She got into freelance writing and editing and planned to start her own creative collective. After quitting, Ms. Sobel faced some financial challenges -- her basement ceiling was in desperate need of repair -- but was adamant that the shift had been a boon for her well-being. She had planned to re-evaluate her professional future at the end of 2022 and didn't rule out returning to work full time.
Where is she now? Ms. Sobel has had more success than she expected as a freelancer. She said that by working 30 hours per week for various clients, her gross income was "just about at 100 percent" of what she had earned working full-time. She said she could now afford to fix her ceiling and had signed a contract to do so. Ms. Sobel is also almost ready to start her creative collective and plans to sign up for life insurance, which she previously had through her full-time job.
Was quitting worth it? Ms. Sobel said she had more ownership of her time and was in good financial health. She doesn't plan on returning to the full-time work force anytime soon.
"When I first did it, I thought it would be a temporary thing," Ms. Sobel said. "But it's working out so well, it doesn't have to be temporary."
Susan Woodland
Susan Woodland, 68, left her position as director of collections at a New York City museum in May 2020. She relied on her substantial savings and money from investments to make ends meet, but acknowledged that finances were a little tight.
Where is she now? Ms. Woodland is working one day per week, for a historical society. Because of inflation, she has had to increase the amount of money she takes out of her investments every month. She has managed to live off less than when she was working full time. It helps that she has Medicare and owns her Manhattan apartment, she said.
Was quitting worth it? Ms. Woodland has always been frugal and so is well prepared for the present climate. She has found meaning in spending her time following her interests, mapping out a future writing project about the dark side of the fashion industry and volunteering for a local abortion clinic. "Instead of focusing 100 percent of the time on myself, I want to try and do things that are actually of value to people," she said.
Jennifer Padham
Early in the pandemic Jennifer Padham, 41, and her partner purchased a sprawling property in the woods of New Hampton, N.Y. Ms. Padham, who had quit her job as an archivist at Netflix shortly before the pandemic, planned to turn the property into a spiritual retreat center. She lived in one of the five cottages on the land.
Where is she now? Ms. Padham's timeline for the retreat center has been pushed back, in part because of a split with her partner, but she hopes to open it by the end of 2023. In the meantime, she has turned two of the cottages into Airbnb rentals. She uses the profits to support herself and to continue developing the center. The units have been booked less often this winter than the last one, Ms. Padham said.
Was quitting worth it? Ms. Padham has found value in learning to adapt her vision. "I'm just allowing the seasons to show me what this place wants to be, and what's really best," Ms. Padham said. "I'm trying not to impose a system on it."

PRAGUE — Anyone who didn’t live through the Cold War might find the Portuguese Netflix spy thriller series “Glória” improbable.
Deep in the Portuguese countryside, in the tiny village of Glória, a complex radio transmission operation run by Portuguese and American engineers springs up in the 1950s, a branch of a Munich-based news organization called Radio Free Europe.
It broadcasts news and anti-communist messages in languages of various Soviet republics, but, in the show and in real life, that’s only part of its early mission: It’s also a CIA front.
Until 1971, Radio Free Europe was a covert U.S. intelligence operation seeking to penetrate the Iron Curtain and foment anti-communist dissent in what was then Czechoslovakia, in Poland and elsewhere.
The CIA stopped funding Radio Free Europe when its operation was revealed. Since then, the news organization has been funded by the U.S. Congress and has had editorial independence.
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty — or RFE/RL — now barely resembles its historical predecessor, as dramatized in “Glória,” but it is still very much pursuing its mission of fact-based journalism by local reporters, in local languages for local audiences across the former Soviet sphere and Central Asia.
The organization is now based in Prague instead of Munich, and is growing, opening new offices this month in Riga, Latvia, to host a big part of its Russia-focused staff.
These days, RFE/RL is only partly a radio broadcaster, although in some regions, the airwaves are still how people access it. The majority of its Russian-language audience finds its reporting online, especially through social-media platforms.
At the Prague offices, high gates, tight security checks and U.S. flags waving up front leave visitors little doubt that they are entering a building with American ties.
But this great gray marble-and-concrete cube — just up a hill from where Franz Kafka is buried — holds a modern newsroom that reaches millions of people each week.
The outlet says it draws an average of 40 million people weekly through its programs and channels, broadcasting in 27 languages and 23 countries “where media freedom is restricted, or where a professional press has not fully developed.”
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February both shook up Radio Free Europe’s operations and highlighted its mission’s importance. Within days of the invasion, the organization suspended its operations in Russia. It had already faced years of growing pressure from Moscow and evacuated most staff to Prague and other offices even before the war broke out.
Jamie Fly, the broadcaster’s president and CEO, has long been in firefighting mode.
“The challenge we’re facing now, and the invasion of Ukraine, is just the latest iteration,” Fly said in an interview late last year. “We are increasingly getting pressure when we’re operating in these environments, and in some cases, we’re getting pushed out of countries. That’s always been a challenge for us.”
Strictures in Taliban-led Afghanistan and authoritarian Belarus are among the broadcaster’s other severe challenges.
According to the RFE/RL, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought in new audiences, despite the fact that its engineers have to work constantly to get ahead of censors by finding new ways to circumvent prohibitions in Russia and elsewhere.
In the first week of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, traffic to RFE/RL websites almost tripled to nearly 70 million, compared with the same week in 2021, the organization said. More than half of that traffic came from Russia and Ukraine.
Those gains have stabilized since then. From the start of the war through the end of 2022, viewership of Current Time, RFE/RL’s flagship Russian-language channel, more than tripled on Facebook and more than quadrupled on YouTube, where it remains accessible within Russia, according to RFE/RL.
The broadcaster’s work in Central Asian countries like Kyrgyzstan has been impactful, especially in uncovering corruption. The local network was blocked last year by the Kyrgyz government on accusations that it breached a “fake news” law. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty rejected the claims and, as it did in Russia, encouraged its audience to use VPNs to continue following its journalism.
And while its coverage of the war in Ukraine is a crucial part of its offerings, the organization’s most distinctive service is its region-specific programs broadcast in the local vernacular, including those focusing on Russian areas like Chechnya and Tatarstan.
This approach — even for languages spoken only by small populations — has long been a key feature of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty operations.
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, a former president of Estonia who worked for the broadcaster in Munich from 1984 to 1993, said that reaching those audiences with objective, quality news, in their own languages, was particularly vital.
“RFE/RL’s role is most important in providing objective information in the native language — and is the same role it had 30 years ago,” he said in a phone interview last week.
He added that this mission became more critical for audiences without the many information outlets that the Russian-speaking world has. “There are limited sources of quality information for others, and being able to hear quality news reporting in your own language is important,” he said.
And, as in Ilves’ time at the organization, its 21st-century incarnation is a kind of Noah’s ark for journalists and émigrés from a vast region undergoing another period of epochal change.
On March 6, 10 days after Russia invaded Ukraine, RFE/RL announced it would suspend its Moscow operations after the local authorities began bankruptcy proceedings against it, citing millions of dollars in unpaid fines over the organization’s refusal to comply with a 2021 order to label itself and some of its staff as foreign agents.
“We are nobody’s agent, and we considered — and continue to consider — this labeling demand to be censorship, an attempt to interfere in editorial policy,” Andrei Shary, director of RFE/RL’s Russian Service, said at the time.
Shary, who describes himself as a “proud Russian,” has made a home in Prague, as have some of his other Russian colleagues.
Fly thinks Shary would most likely be jailed if he returned to Russia. It’s a reality Shary confronts with stoicism, even though, he says, “I’ll probably never get to see my mother alive again.”
Some in the younger generation of journalists who left the Moscow bureau feel relief at having relocated safely before the invasion, avoiding the panic of friends who fled overnight.
Anastasia Tishchenko, 29, a human-rights reporter, said she struggled with the decision to relocate to the broadcaster’s office in Prague in 2021. It was a time when “you could feel some kind of danger” because of Russian pressure on the network, she said. “But you still didn’t see anything specifically dangerous to you.”
“Now I think that it’s one of the best decisions in my life,” she said in an interview, adding, “All of my friends who are well-educated, if they had opportunities, they escaped, living in Germany, Turkey, Portugal — but not in Russia.”
Tishchenko’s heartbreak has been that she has had a falling out with her parents over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Her parents, who were born in Ukraine, believe the Kremlin’s version of events — that Russia is conducting a liberation operation fighting against an oppressive government in Kyiv, and winning. It is a divide that is playing out among countless families.
She said she didn’t know if she would ever be able to go home to Russia and tried instead to focus on her work in Prague as part of a supportive community of people like her.
“To dream about one day going home, to walk on the streets I grew up in, to play with my sister’s child, that’s just a dream,” she said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: What's Up? (Jan. 15-21)
The U.S. Hits Its Debt Ceiling
The United States hit its borrowing cap of $ 31.4 trillion on Thursday, setting the stage for a bitter fiscal fight in Congress over raising the limit. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said the government would take "extraordinary measures," at least until early June, to keep paying its bills. Democrats and the White House, as well as forecasters and economists, have warned that the nation risks a financial crisis and other dire economic scenarios if lawmakers do not raise the limit before the Treasury Department exhausts its ability to buy more time. But Republicans have said that they will not raise the borrowing limit again unless President Biden agrees to steep cuts in federal spending.
"Samcoins" and FTX's Final Days
As the government continues building a case against the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, more details are emerging about the workings of the exchange. Rivals said that Mr. Bankman-Fried often promoted digital currencies, known as "Samcoins." Mr. Bankman-Fried was said to use his influence to persuade people to buy large quantities of the coins, inflating their value artificially, to make his crypto trading firm, Alameda Research, look healthier than it really was. (Mr. Bankman-Fried has denied accusations that he tried to manipulate cryptocurrency markets.) Also, documents obtained by The New York Times show that FTX executives voiced concerns over the use of customer funds in the weeks leading up to the collapse of the firm.
More Layoffs in Big Tech
Two of the tech industry's biggest players announced last week that they would be cutting thousands of jobs. Microsoft said on Wednesday that it would lay off about 10,000 workers, and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said on Friday that it would lay off 12,000 employees. Across the tech industry, employers are pulling back after several years of frenetic hiring to meet the pandemic-fueled surge in online services. Nearly 200,000 tech workers have lost their jobs since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks job cuts in the sector. Even the industry's power players have been affected: Apple is the only major firm that has not yet announced significant cuts. Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, said at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week that "quite frankly, we in the tech industry will also have to get efficient."
What's Next? (Jan. 22-28)
Initial Estimates of Economic Growth
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release on Thursday initial estimates of economic growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022. The report on gross domestic product is likely to show that economic output, adjusted for inflation, increased at an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the quarter, according to predictions from forecasters. That would represent a slowdown from the rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter. The Federal Reserve's campaign to rein in inflation by raising interest rates is taking a toll on the economy, especially the housing market. Although consumer spending has slowed, the economy has shown surprising resilience after contracting in the first half of last year.
The Holidays and the Airlines
The major airlines are in the midst of reporting their earnings, which will show how their bottom lines in the fourth quarter were affected by a holiday season marred by cancellations and storms. The carriers suffered further woes this month, when a Federal Aviation Administration system outage halted flights. Most of the attention will be on Southwest because of its meltdown over the holidays. Southwest will release earnings on Thursday, along with American, JetBlue and Alaska. Delta and United, which released their earnings last week, surprised analysts with strong fourth-quarter results. Both companies expressed optimism about the months ahead.
Slower Spending?
Though many consumer-focused business have done reasonably well over the past year, cracks are beginning to show. Companies have passed on rising energy, transportation and labor costs to consumers, and until recently, consumers have paid the higher prices. Inflation has moderated some. But the holiday season showed that consumers may finally be pushing back. Retail sales fell in December, following a decline in November. Procter & Gamble's annual sales dropped last quarter for the first time in over five years. The company, which makes products like Tide detergent, Head & Shoulders shampoo and Charmin toilet paper, said that its sales dropped 1 percent in the three months through December, compared with the same period a year earlier. The sales volume, or amount of goods consumers bought, also fell 6 percent. The shift came as the company increased prices 10 percent last quarter from a year earlier.
What Else?
The price of bitcoin rallied. California joined other states in suing major drug companies over the price of insulin. Reed Hastings, a founder of Netflix, cedes his co-chief executive title to become the company's executive chairman. Tax filing season begins on Monday.

Pictures From Home, Onstage: [Op-Ed]

Full text: In 1982, on a visit to his parents in Los Angeles, the photographer Larry Sultan came across home movies of his childhood, among them those that show the aftermath of his family's move west from Brooklyn, the city of his birth, to a land of lawns and beaches and road trips and new cars in perpetual 1950s Southern California sunshine.
"They were remarkable, more like a record of hopes and fantasies than actual events," Mr. Sultan wrote in "Pictures From Home," the 1992 book he eventually made in response to these "30 years of folk tales" that had been etched in collective familial memory as historical record. The book became a landmark in narrative photography -- part of an iconic body of work both deeply personal and conceptual, lyrical and honest, merging images and text. Mr. Sultan died in 2009, but his work and legacy have helped draw three major stars to the Broadway adaptation, the rare play based on a book of photography.
This month, just past the lone disco ball hung in the entrance of Studio 54, now a Broadway theater, the first day of tech rehearsals was being held for "Pictures From Home," adapted by the playwright Sharr White, creator of the Netflix series "Halston." The play features Danny Burstein as Larry Sultan, with Nathan Lane and Zoë Wanamaker playing his parents, Irving and Jean. Irving Sultan, who was raised partly in a New York orphanage and became a successful salesman, demands, "Where's the rigor?" in the life of his adult artist son. Jean calls real estate her "hobby." In the book she says, "I sold $ 18 million worth of property in the first year."
When the younger Mr. Sultan began re-examining his home movies, he was in his 30s, Ronald Reagan was president and the idea of "family" had been fetishized as a symbol of conservative ideology. "I wanted to puncture this mythology of the family and show what happens when we are driven by images of success," Mr. Sultan wrote. "And I was willing to use my family to prove a point."
His parents were reluctant accomplices. Mr. Lane, as Irving, grumbles about the times Larry accidentally leaves the lens cap on -- "I just wonder if those were the 'mythical shots' he was looking for!" And yet, Mr. Burstein's Larry addresses the audience, "What's fascinating to me is how he can both mock and participate at the same time."
Once, Mr. Sultan wrote, photographing his napping mother, he realized she had secretly woken: "She felt me looking." Were his parents motivated by a desire to set the record straight, or was it love? For eight, nine, 10 years they put up with it, become actors in their son's pictures, playing the part even as they insisted, in extensive, first-person text Mr. Sultan included in the book, on their own versions of the truth.
Throughout the 1980s Mr. Sultan intermittently visited his parents in Southern California. He was living in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he eventually became a professor at California College of the Arts, married his wife, Kelly, and raised two sons. There would be a Valium waiting for him bedside left by Jean, to help him sleep; there was the "day-to-day stuff," as Irving put it, his parents' aggravations and choreographed routines; there were the eerie preprogrammed sounds the house made at night signaling the life it maintained on its own, with timers for sprinklers and lights.
In his book, Mr. Sultan acknowledges his initial impulse to work forensically, anthropologically, photographing bedside tables, opening closets, drawers. He writes shooting lists that move between concept ("Project the Dale Carnegie photograph and do portrait of Dad standing in front of it") to figments of memory and absorbed remark: "His prize roses, her chopped liver ... We caught crayfish in the wash, set them on fire just to hear them scream, the sun in our eyes when we ate dinner." Those lists sit alongside frames of Irving and Jean -- at breakfast, fixing the vacuum cleaner, talking through the window -- pictures that blur the line between documentary and staged.
This is a slipperiness Mr. Sultan aspired to. In a 2003 interview he said, "To me, the truth is about performance, how we perform, how we project, and the truth can be staged and it can be found. I don't think there is such a division between the two."
"What kind of book is it?" Irving asks in the play. It's not a novel, not a biography. Was it even possible to make a play out of a photobook, something that anybody could see themselves in, something that does justice to the layered and complex ways in which Mr. Sultan's words and pictures contradict each other and, ultimately, converge? The question lodged in Mr. White's mind when he encountered a retrospective of Mr. Sultan's work that was on view at Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2014 and 2015.
"When I first read the script, I knew immediately it was kind of a memory play," said the scenic designer Michael Yeargan, who worked with the director of "Pictures From Home," Bartlett Sher, on his revival of "South Pacific." "Then I went to the pictures themselves. You start looking for an envelope that will contain everything."
Onstage that envelope fills to encompass the furniture of multiple spaces and eras that exist simultaneously, memory and image fusing with present action -- Larry's studio, the midcentury desk of Jean's home office, the refrigerator in its time capsule hue of harvest gold, the palm leaf-patterned sofa and coffee table strewn with Irv's newspapers, and the sliding door to outside, the garden, the horizon. The objects that appear like familial artifacts in the play were sourced or copied as closely as possible. "The color period is avocado in August," Mr. Yeargan says.
On the first day of costumed rehearsal, the wigs come out. "I look like Jor-El," Mr. Lane says, walking on with salt-white hair -- not a helmet, exactly since it moves, but coifed. "Superman's father." As soon as anyone in earshot has mentally conjured an image of Marlon Brando in the Superman films, Mr. Lane is gleefully riffing on another 1980s icon: "John DeLorean."
To their children, all fathers look a little bit famous. Older Irving drew comparisons to Johnny Carson, Mr. Sultan wrote. Even as he tried to shake Irving out of his stubbornly exaggerated, go-to pose ("like you're acting the role of the heroic executive in an annual report"), Mr. Sultan's memory of his recalcitrant father was also colored by childhood adoration. "He may have been Frank Sinatra to my mother," Mr. Sultan wrote, "but to me he was James Dean."
Ms. Wanamaker, in 1980s California real estate agent pale pleated pants, studies Mr. Lane, fixes a stray hair, like a wife appraising her husband just home from the barber. Later Mr. Lane brushes Mr. Burstein's dark shaggy new bangs out of his eyes.
"It's only when I give up trying to make pictures and begin to enjoy the time spent with them that anything of value ever happens," Mr. Sultan wrote. As the pauses for tech stretch longer, Mr. Burstein and Mr. Lane lean back on the sofa cracking jokes. When Ms. Wanamaker crosses the stage, retraces her steps, muttering to herself, rummaging through her tote bag, flipping up the sofa cushions, it's becoming harder and harder to tell who she is: Jean Sultan or Zoë Wanamaker, or somewhere in between.
When the actors return from a break, their wigs have been modified just perceptibly, as if a couple of months have passed in an hour, as if Larry is back home for another visit, mining the subtle differences since the last time. "Larry, I need your help figuring something out. Am I limping?" Irving asks his son outside the airport terminal, comically attempting to conceal it. As he stiffly rolls Larry's suitcase across the imaginary tarmac, Irving's foot drags behind him.
In the glacial process of tech rehearsal, as sound and lighting cues are mapped out, scenes creep slowly forward, are paused for long minutes, wound backward, begun again, starting from the top. A theater during tech feels like a black hole.
It's not unlike the way memory works. It's not unlike a darkroom.
This is the darkness of creating -- writing, photographing, rehearsing -- and the point at which the work is making itself known. "Tell me, Larry, how long do you plan to keep doing this thing?" Irving asks.
Some time into the project, Mr. Sultan woke up in the middle of the night, struck by a plain and jarring revelation. "These are my parents," he wrote. "From that simple fact, everything follows. I realize that beyond the rolls of film and the few good pictures, the demands of my project and my confusion about its meaning, is the wish to take photography literally. To stop time. I want my parents to live forever."
On the first day of tech rehearsals, projections of Mr. Sultan's photographs loom on the back wall, at first roughly the dimensions of an overlarge museum print, before being adjusted, enlarged, to cinematic scale. The actors stand onstage, before the image, making three shadows against the picture.
One of the projections shows Jean Sultan in the garage, in saturated suntan and makeup, heading to one of her listings. The projection is reflected in a device mounted to the balcony. Below, a copy of "Pictures From Home" sits on Mr. Sher's director's table, sometimes borrowed by those working in the dressing room, where Mr. Sultan's photographs of his parents are taped as references to racks of color-coordinated pantsuits and velour and leisurewear.
Moments later, when the actors break for dinner, the understudies quietly assemble in a basement lounge, running lines at fast-forward speed, like analog videotapes, the era of Mr. Sultan's photos. In a few minutes they are scenes ahead of the last place Mr. Burstein, Mr. Lane and Ms. Wanamaker have left off onstage, their muted voices joining the galaxy of images and words of Irving, Jean and Larry that exist all over this theater.
Alec Soth is uploading photographs from his camera, I'm writing notes, creating still more Larrys, Jeans, and Irvs. The meta process of magnifying them makes them feel more intimate and personal. Not exactly immortal, but part of an infinite conversation, the roles that we keep endlessly reproducing and repeating, rebelling against one another as we grow closer and further, become versions of each other, slip away.
I can't help wondering what Irving and Jean Sultan would have made of all this, a Broadway play. What their son would have. He wanted images to "become part of a larger narrative," he said, "to slam up against other images (an afterimage). I want to measure how a life was lived against how a life was dreamed."

Lily Collins Loves Coffee and Coziness: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Lily Collins explores the city, and the world, with the help of Monocle, word searches and Norwegian coffee.
Lily Collins has been "Emily in Paris" for so long that she's expected to be a Parisian authority. Three seasons into her run as Emily Cooper, an American marketing executive on assignment in the City of Light, she spends large portions of the year in France and is constantly asked for recommendations. But she's there to work.
"I don't have as much free time as I wish that I had to explore," she said in a phone interview, which she conducted from her car, parked next to the road in Los Angeles before an appointment. "I'm constantly discovering new places and asking for people's lists because I like the non-tourist spots."
Collins, 33, has been building her own list by scootering along the Seine, making regular visits to Canal Saint-Martin, and getting to know the side streets around the Clignancourt flea market. But, she admits, one of the best sights in the city is still its most famous.
"Whenever I'm in the city and I look up and I see the Eiffel Tower, it doesn't matter how many times I've seen it, I still get giddy," she says. "It's such a feat."
Season 3 of "Emily in Paris" began streaming on Netflix last month. Collins spoke with us about Five Minute Journals, the concept of hygge and other things she gravitates to at home, in Paris and beyond. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
1. Greeting Cards I have a box where I keep cards that I'm saving for people. Some are over 10 years old. I have people in mind and I'll get them cards knowing that one day they're going to have a 25th birthday and they will need this card. I love the idea that a single piece of paper can say so much about how you've been thinking of someone.
2. Self-Portraits It's so interesting when an artist or a photographer paints, draws or takes a self-portrait because it's such an inside look into how someone views themselves. The late photographer Vivian Maier is a really beautiful example.
3. The Five Minute Journal It gives you easy prompts to answer and helps you be aware of how you can view things in multiple different ways. Instead of saying the crap that happened to you that day and how you were so upset about something, you get to look at how you could have handled certain things throughout the day better, what you were grateful for, what you're excited about and what's good in your life. You also write daily affirmations and things that you would like to accomplish. It's beautiful to look back to previous journals and see how far you've grown.
4. Treehotel One of the bucket-list places that I'd been wanting to stay in was the Treehotel in Swedish Lapland, which is basically a collection of beautiful tree houses. Each tree house looks like something different -- a bird's nest, a U.F.O., a steel dragonfly. My husband booked us one during our honeymoon that's high in the trees. Staying there, you get to feel like an adventurer and you get that little kid feeling that I've always loved.
5. Word Searches I have always carried a word search book with me on flights. It's a way to turn my mind off. They put me in a kind of meditative trance. Also, I get a weird sense of accomplishment when I complete one.
6. Dried Flowers When we go to farmers' markets, I always end up finding amazing dried flowers. I sometimes keep them for years so I can look at different flowers and remember where I got them. If I get them from a farmers' market in a different city or in a different country, I push them in books and bring them back. They're such romantic mementos.
7. "Van Go" On the Magnolia Network show "Van Go," Brett Lewis converts things like vans and sprinters into homes, stores, food trucks -- whatever people want. It's an interesting way to see what people need, what they want and what their aesthetics are. It's also a look at what the core necessities are when you pare things down and what can be done in such a small space.
8. Hygge I've always been someone who loves being cozy: cozy socks, my grandma's cozy sweater, a fire going, playing a game with friends or family -- being cozy in an environment is so important to me. When I learned about the Danish concept, hygge, I felt seen, like, oh my God, someone gets me.
9. Coffee I look for coffee shops everywhere I go. In a foreign city, they can provide a sense of home and a sense of comfort. There's a Norwegian coffee brand called Tim Wendelboe that I've discovered on our many trips to Denmark. It's probably the most incredible coffee I've ever had.
10. Monocle When we're traveling, we sometimes schedule our trips around things we read about in Monocle magazine. Art, fashion, you name it, they have the places where residents go and that celebrate local artisans. It also can help dictate where we go next. If there's a place that is so cool and has all these amazing places to visit that we didn't know about, maybe that's the next destination.

Full text: Both "Everything Everywhere All at Once" and the "Knives Out" sequel delve into the abyss, where life has no meaning. What they do next is surprising.

"I got bored one day and I put everything on a bagel. Everything -- all my hopes and dreams, my old report cards, every breed of dog, every last personal ad on Craigslist, sesame, poppy seed, salt," Jobu Tupaki (Stephanie Hsu) says in the faultless, head-spinning science fiction film "Everything Everywhere All at Once."
She's explaining this to Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh), a laundromat owner who has strained relationships with both her goofy though pure-hearted husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan), and her daughter, Joy, who, in an alternate universe, is also Jobu Tupaki, a goddess of destruction. Jobu Tupaki tells her the everything bagel eventually collapsed in on itself and became the ultimate truth: "Nothing matters."
Two of the most memorable objects in film last year were conceptual foodstuffs: In "Everything Everywhere," the bagel is an entryway to the abyss, and in "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery," the titular vegetable offers layers and layers of intrigue that ultimately amount to nothing. In both films, the nihilistic foods threaten to leave the plot at a dead end. And yet both films then use that impasse to subvert the expectations of the genres in which they're working.
Though the multiverse has, in recent years, become the default direction for moneymaking franchises to go in, the concept is difficult to successfully execute. Opening up a fictional world to alternate universes means keeping a tight leash on the narrative and the world-building, making sure that neither gets bloated to the point where there are endless loopholes as well as inconsistencies and unresolved questions.
But there's also the issue of emotional stakes. If every plot point and character can be reset in another universe, then every moment of resonance, particularly tragedies -- think of Rick and Morty rendered lifeless, mangled and bloodied in a garage explosion, or the Scarlet Witch's vicious murders of Charles Xavier and the superhero illuminati -- can be undone with the help of a portal gun, Time Variance Authority TemPad or other time-manipulating device.
Once you can see every universe, suddenly none of them seem to matter. The multiverse inevitably leads to madness: Though an alternate Waymond cautions Evelyn against making too many universe jumps, for fear that she'll become like Jobu Tupaki, she does so anyway, and is almost seduced by her alternate-daughter's nihilism. But the film, written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, cleverly uses the everything bagel, a symbol of the nothingness at the heart of Jobu Tupaki's philosophy as well as the nothingness at the heart of so many multiverse stories, to ground the story and show what a well-executed multiverse movie can achieve.
When Evelyn learns about her other selves, and their relationships and very different lives, instead of everything seeming inconsequential, she is able to make new connections with those around her and understand the limitless potential she didn't know she had. After witnessing visions of life without Waymond and discovering that another version of herself pushed Joy so hard that she became Jobu Tupaki, Evelyn earns a new gratitude for her family.
Meaning and purpose are the antitheses to the nothingness of the everything bagel. And established characters and stakes are the antitheses to the lazy multiverse narrative.
Just as multiverse superhero shows and movies get a bad rap, so do murder mystery films. Like a game of "Clue," they can be formulaic, with even their twists becoming accepted tropes -- often as transparent as, say, a glass onion.
In Rian Johnson's "Knives Out" sequel, Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is back with his foppish threads and Southern drawl to join the billionaire Miles Bron (Edward Norton) for a murder mystery weekend on a private island, where an actual murder soon takes place.
Bron, an obnoxious hybrid of Elon Musk, Steve Jobs and Elizabeth Holmes, welcomes his guests into a flashy world of wealth, where he casually shows off Paul McCartney's guitar and the Mona Lisa, has a robot carry off their luggage and even seemingly has his own Covid-19 vaccine (the film takes place early in the pandemic).
The film, like the original, uses many clichés of the genre: a clandestine invitation, a group of people stuck in a remote location, an eccentric "genius," priceless treasures, a suspicious character from the past, a secret twin, a faked death. But the fun of "Glass Onion" is that it takes these tropes to build what appears to be an elaborate murder scheme, only to reveal that the crime was much more straightforward than it seemed.
"I keep returning in my mind to the glass onion," Blanc says in the final act, "something that seems densely layered, mysterious and inscrutable. But in fact, the center is in plain sight." Bron, he reveals, is the murderer, but he's no criminal mastermind; he's stupid, and, to Blanc's disgust, even unoriginal when it comes to plotting his friends' deaths.
According to the murder mystery formula, when the detective solves the case, it's over; our contract with this fictional world ends when we get the bad guy. "Glass Onion" also subverts that expectation through its structure: At exactly halfway through the movie, Blanc has figured it out, but before he explains everything, "Glass Onion" cuts to the past. Once Blanc's real reason for joining Bron's get-together is clear, the film moves through the plot again to show us the same characters and events from a new perspective.
But the movie's greatest subversion is its ending. The villain isn't defeated by traditional means; though Blanc solves the case, Bron disposes of the single bit of evidence that could put him away, rendering Blanc powerless to do anything. So Bron wins -- until his glass onion and the priceless artwork inside go up in flames. At the last minute, "Glass Onion" pivots from an enjoyable but hollow murder mystery into a contemporary morality tale about the dangers of capitalist ambitions.
The boundless emptiness of the everything bagel and the crystal-clear nothing at the center of the glass onion illustrate the ultimate fakeouts: They threaten to swallow their worlds (or universes) in a kind of cinematic existentialism, where a deli favorite and a vegetable prove there's nothing worth accounting for in a multiverse or a mystery island. But both "Everything Everywhere All at Once" and "Glass Onion" know how to navigate their genres and show that behind the emptiness of your favorite conceptual foodstuff can be surprises, universes -- everything.

The Era of Happy Tech Workers Is Over: [Op-Ed]

Author: Rawlinson, Nadia

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Silicon Valley as we know it -- with its radically transparent company cultures, empowered employees, flat hierarchies and rarefied perks like nap pods and free food -- is quickly disappearing. And it's unlikely to return.
For nearly two decades, tech companies heralded an approach that centered on making workers happy with benefits that were intended to seamlessly integrate work and life. They made well-being programs and unlimited vacation, initiatives that prioritized the whole person, standard employee benefits. This, along with high salaries and equity packages, was a way not just to win but also to dominate the war for talent. The rapid growth and success of Silicon Valley companies, driven in part by their unique people practices, reimagined workplace culture for a generation.
Times, as they say, are a-changin'. The industry is facing an uneven macroeconomic environment and a roiling stock market that is putting pressure on public tech companies and making for a less-than-ideal I.P.O. environment for private ones. Tech chief executives are now optimizing more for profitability than for growth at all costs, sometimes at the expense of long-held organizational beliefs.
The shift is most evident in the recent surge of tech layoffs. There has been lots of public discussion about the disruptive axing of half of Twitter's 7,500 employees, a move conducted under its new owner, Elon Musk. Haphazard and rolling, the layoffs were painful to watch. The employees who remained have had to endure greater workloads on significantly smaller teams. But while outsiders may have viewed these layoffs as impulsive, they seemed to have primed the environment for other tech companies to follow. In 2022, the tech industry laid off over 150,000 people. In the first few weeks of 2023, Microsoft announced 10,000 job cuts and Alphabet followed with 12,000.
According to multiple media outlets, Meta and Amazon use stack ranking for their employees, a controversial approach in evaluating talent. Popularized by G.E. in the 1980s (though the company later abandoned it), the process has managers rate their employees on a forced curve. Generally, only 20 percent are deemed top talent, and 10 to 15 percent must be designated as low performers. Although there are benefits, even in the best of times, the practice can create a competitive work environment that de-emphasizes employee improvement. With impending layoffs, people with the lowest ranking are typically the first to go.
The layoffs are part of a new age of bossism, the notion that management has given up too much control and must wrest it back from employees. After two decades of fighting for talent, chief executives are using this period to adjust for years of management indulgence that left them with a generation of entitled workers.
In 2012, to spur innovation and drive engagement, LinkedIn began the incubator program. A perk that encouraged employees to come up with approved ideas that they could work on full time for up to three months was generous even by Silicon Valley standards. Then there were the many lavish events that served to put a company's culture on display. It was par for the course for employees to attend elaborately themed holiday parties featuring the next new Instagrammable experience. If you happened to work at Uber in 2015 and attended its corporate event in Las Vegas, you were treated to a private performance from Beyoncé.
Executives across industries are leaning into their newfound bossism and ending pandemic-era work arrangements and incentives. Reed Hastings, Netflix's co-founder and co-C.E.O., said near the start of the pandemic that he didn't "see any positives" in working from home, and the company apparently allows only some remote work. TikTok reportedly told employees that it was sunsetting gym membership and Wi-Fi reimbursements as well as its $ 45 daily meal stipends to workers not tied to the company's main hubs, in its own efforts at restraint. These changes are bellwethers.
Not all tech employees see these shifts as signals. I recently spoke with a product marketing manager from Meta who was laid off. I assumed that she would be apprehensive about her job prospects; instead, armed with three months' severance and decent savings, she remains optimistic. With nearly 79 percent of software engineers and nearly 76 percent of marketers who were laid off in tech finding jobs within three months, her optimism isn't necessarily unfounded.
However, a few things are true now that make the shift in tech employee culture not just a moment in time but also a redefinition of how tech companies will be run.
Meta and Salesforce combined lost more than $ 700 billion in market cap last year. Both companies are now dealing with activist investors who have taken prominent positions in their stocks. The activists have called for the companies to slash costs, reduce nonstrategic investments and, notably in Meta's case, aggressively reduce its work force. Managers have less capacity to overhire and invest in employee initiatives that aren't tied directly to business execution.
For tech start-ups and founder-C.E.O.s, the past 10 years were a bull run. Interest rates were low, venture funding seemed limitless and valuations skyrocketed. With money being essentially free, founder-C.E.O.s dived in -- pursuing revenue, increasing their customer bases and investing in myriad people and projects.
However, with recent interest rates the highest they have been since late 2007 and continuing market uncertainty, investors are considering more investments in companies with strong fundamentals and cash flows. For founder-C.E.O.s, this means it will be harder to raise funding, and investors will have an even greater expectation of return on their money. For large tech companies and start-ups alike, cash is no longer free, and employee investments must pay off.
We are entering an era of external investor pressure, higher financing hurdles and overall market volatility. This environment calls for management to make structural changes in the way workplace culture is experienced for both labor and capital.
The current tech work force is used to every voice getting a vote, and it will now have to yield to a new world -- one with heightened expectations and disciplined investment. Not considering the winds of change will put the careers of many empowered workers at risk.

Struggling to Save, Young People Feel Weary of Lectures: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Young people want to save for their futures, but balancing priorities has proved challenging during a time of economic instability.
Shea German-Tanner tries to put a portion of her paycheck, even if it is only $ 50, into her savings account. But most of the time, she has to reroute the cash back to her checking to afford her expenses. Ms. German-Tanner, 22, has about $ 600 in her savings account right now and has not started saving for retirement.
"Everyone's telling you to save money and do this and invest, and I feel like I can't do that because I'm living paycheck to paycheck," said Ms. German-Tanner, a social worker in Fort Wayne, Ind., who makes about $ 40,000 a year. She said she felt that inflation had impeded her ability to save money.
Young people who are just starting to get their footing as they enter adulthood are grappling with how to balance their incomes and spending priorities so they have money left over to save for emergencies and retirement. Worrying about saving has always been hard for 20-somethings who begin their careers at the bottom of their earning potential. But saving is especially difficult right now because on top of student debt, housing and food costs remain high even as inflation has started to cool.
Ms. German-Tanner said 20-somethings were often encouraged to take financial steps like build emergency funds, save for retirement and pay off debt. They're advised to invest when the market is down and to start thinking about their futures as early as possible. The FIRE movement (an acronym for "financial independence, retire early") has been glorified in recent articles, and videos about budgeting and saving in Roth individual retirement accounts have taken over TikTok.
"I feel like the older generation is constantly pushing you to do stuff like they did when they were in their 20s, but it's not even comparable to when they were in their 20s," Ms. German-Tanner said.
Theresa Fairless, a 25-year-old project manager in Aberdeen, N.J., said paying off student loans was her priority. Ms. Fairless graduated from college in 2018 with about $ 25,900 in government loans and $ 50,000 in personal loans. So far, she has paid off all her personal loans and has about $ 23,000 left to pay off in government loans because she has not been making payments during the student loan pause period.
"I was the first person I knew who had to deal with loans," Ms. Fairless said.
She had lived at home since she graduated, and recently moved in with her boyfriend to an apartment nearby, but he is paying a larger share of the rent than she is because he makes more money. Ms. Fairless, who makes about $ 65,000 a year, also gives money to her mother each month since her father died recently and her mother does not have savings.
When Ms. Fairless was living at home, she gave her mother $ 300 a month. Now, she gives her $ 200. She also saves about $ 160 a month for retirement in a 401(k) plan, puts $ 100 in a stock portfolio and tries to save $ 50 to $ 200 in a savings account.
"I always wanted my emergency fund to be at $ 10,000," she said. "I have it there, and I feel like I need it to be more. I honestly feel like I'm not just saving for myself -- I'm saving for my mom because I know she doesn't have one."
For Thea Pham, a first-generation Vietnamese immigrant, sending money to her family is also a priority. Ms. Pham, 27, lives in Los Angeles with her husband. She works in finance and was unable to disclose exactly how much she makes because of regulations around her job, but she said most people in her position earned $ 160,000 to $ 250,000 annually.
She also has a TikTok account with more than 450,000 followers, where she posts about mental health issues. Ms. Pham acknowledges she has achieved financial stability, but said she did not have the flexibility to spend like friends with similar high incomes because of cultural expectations that she support her family in Vietnam.
"The majority of my paychecks are actually sent home to my family," Ms. Pham said. "I didn't know Americans don't do that and how abnormal it is."
Ms. Pham said most of her husband's paychecks went toward paying their housing and living expenses, to which she contributes up to 20 percent. Any remaining money she makes goes into retirement and investment accounts, expenses like travel or when relatives ask for money.
Kathia Ramirez, 24, is juggling several part-time jobs while she prepares to enroll in college. Ms. Ramirez, who lives in Bensenville, Ill., in a house with her mother, sister and nephew, dropped out of school during the pandemic because she did not want to take classes online.
"I love living at home," Ms. Ramirez said. "It does help me save money. I have a really good relationship with my family."
Between her gigs working at a Mexican seafood restaurant, editing videos for social media and entering data for a manufacturing company, Ms. Ramirez said, she earns roughly $ 2,000 a month, though her income varies based on tips and how much she works. She saves $ 200 to $ 300 a month in a savings account. Otherwise, she spends money on groceries, gas and clothing. She hasn't thought about saving for retirement.
Zach Teutsch, a financial planner and managing partner at Values Added Financial, suggested that young people focus on big spending choices instead of small luxuries like coffee or a subscription.
"Big decisions matter a whole lot more than small decisions," Mr. Teutsch said. "Contrary to some of the advice out there, most 20-somethings should worry more about jobs, housing, transportation and less about lattes and Netflix."
Mr. Teutsch said the time spent worrying about a small purchase could be better devoted to figuring out how to navigate your company's 401(k) plan. He also emphasized the importance of building an emergency fund to cover unforeseen expenses. While many financial advisers suggest having three to six months of expenses saved, even $ 100 can "make a huge difference," he said.
For young people, Mr. Teutsch said, it is a good idea to start self-educating on personal finance and talk about financial issues with friends or engage on social media and share how you save money.
"This is a great time to learn more about money and find unbiased educational sources," he said.
Haley Persichitte, a 24-year-old in Denver, makes fitness and exercise a priority and spends money on Barry's Bootcamp, CorePower Yoga and a ClassPass subscription. She has a monthly car payment and rent, and also likes to go out to dinner with her friends. Ms. Persichitte did not go to college and works as a house manager for a family nearby. She manages to save about $ 600 a month, mostly for emergencies. Ms. Persichitte has saved about $ 15,000 so far, though she said high food and gas prices had made it harder to save recently. Saving for retirement, she said, "hasn't crossed my mind."
Brian Teitelbaum, 28, has taken many of what he feels are the right financial steps: He has an emergency fund, has started investing money and contributes to both a 401(k) and a Roth I.R.A. Mr. Teitelbaum earns about $ 90,000 a year as a project manager in New York City, and he tries to use the subway and cooks at home to save money. His monthly rent is $ 1,650, and he spends around $ 300 a month on groceries. He said that he had not noticed inflation as much as people outside New York might, but that he paid attention to high prices at the grocery store.
Mr. Teitelbaum does not have any student debt and saves about $ 2,000 a month. He puts about $ 600 a month into his 401(k), $ 500 into his Roth I.R.A. and between $ 800 and $ 900 in investment accounts. Mr. Teitelbaum said automatically depositing portions of his paycheck into different savings accounts had helped him.
"I think my favorite thing about finance nowadays is auto deposit," he said.
Mr. Teitelbaum also emphasized the importance of talking about money with family members. He said that he owed his father for providing him with much of his personal finance knowledge and that friends from families who didn't talk about money did not have as much financial literacy.

Vice Media Puts Itself Up for Sale: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Vice, which has struggled to achieve profitability in recent years, has formed a special committee to find suitors.
After Vice Media secured a new round of financing in 2017 that valued the company at $ 5.7 billion, Shane Smith, one of its founders, teased the potential for "hockey stick" growth and a "sexy" stock market debut.
But that once-grandiose talk at Vice has run into reality. The company, which has undergone several rounds of staff cuts in recent years, is putting itself up for sale in a rocky media market -- where it will almost certainly fetch much less than executives had once hoped for.
Nancy Dubuc, the chief executive hired in 2018 to replace Mr. Smith after a reckoning over workplace sexual harassment, said that the company had "turned a corner" and that she and the company's investors had decided to sell to a company that could help it grow.
"Has it been difficult?" Ms. Dubuc said about the company's travails in an interview. "Yeah. Has anybody in my chair had a difficult ride at any company? I would say yes. We tend to be a little bit more public than most because of the curiosities and palace intrigue. But I'm about getting a job done, and we have a job to do, and I intend to do it."
Vice, which started as a punk magazine in Canada in the 1990s before relocating to New York, is a prominent example of the bullish-to-bearish outlook for new media companies over the past decade. Backed by major companies like Disney and 21st Century Fox, which wanted to tap into Vice's young, hip and digitally savvy audience, Mr. Smith struck deal after deal that expanded the company into a big digital presence, a TV network and a film-production company.
But in recent years, Vice has not kept that momentum, struggling to live up to the promise of its lofty valuation. Several other media companies, including BuzzFeed and Vox Media, have run into headwinds in the digital advertising market. Vice is likely to lay off additional staff, according to a memo to employees from Ms. Dubuc on Friday, the same day that Vox Media said it was cutting roughly 7 percent of its work force.
Ken Doctor, a local-media entrepreneur and media business analyst, said Vice's approach to news, often focusing on under-covered stories, had been overshadowed over time by its financial difficulties and pressure from investors.
"It's undeniable that it created real value through that innovation, but the hype ate the reality," Mr. Doctor said. "That was fueled by irrational investment, from the likes of Disney and others, sensing that there was something new here but ignoring some of the fundamentals of news media business realities."
Ms. Dubuc said the company's board was determined to sell for several reasons. Even though Vice is still unprofitable, the company cut its losses in the last year by about 50 percent, she said, and it is aiming to break even this year. Ms. Dubuc also said the company saw single-digit increases in its revenue this year, despite a bearish ad market.
In the interview, Ms. Dubuc said Vice's studio business had grown beyond its roots as an independent film financier and had struck deals with major programmers including Sky, Netflix and the CW. She added that the company's news business had improved after securing increased international distribution and launching projects like its show on the streaming network Twitch.
The company generated about $ 600 million in revenue last year, short of its $ 700 million target, according to one person with knowledge of the company's financials. The Wall Street Journal reported those figures last month.
Ms. Dubuc also acknowledged that Vice's backers were ready to cash out on their investment. In addition to the investments from other media companies, its big investors have included the private-equity giant TPG and the media mogul James Murdoch. She added that the company would benefit from having one owner, instead of numerous investors, that could take a long-term view.
The decision to restart its sales process, first reported by CNBC on Thursday, is the latest chapter in a yearslong quest by Vice and its investors to find a buyer. Two years ago, the company planned to go public through a blank-check company known as a SPAC, a financial vehicle to take private companies public. But that plan fizzled amid cooling investor sentiment.
Last year, the company hired the investment banks PJT and LionTree to explore selling some or all of its assets after suitors approached Vice to buy parts of the company, including its Virtue advertising agency and its studio business.
That process led to conversations with Antenna, a Greek media company that is a major buyer of Vice content. But those discussions stalled before the end of the year. Antenna is still a potential suitor for Vice, according to one person familiar with the company's interest, but it is no longer holding extensive negotiations with the company.
This month, after the earlier sale process stalled, Vice Media's board of directors formed a special committee to direct the sales process of some or all of the company.
Media valuations are down amid an uncertain ad market, giving buyers more leverage during negotiations. Even the giants of the industry like Disney and NBCUniversal are being tested by declines in traditional TV viewership and video-streaming business that hemorrhage cash.
Ms. Dubuc said Vice had made significant strides toward improving its culture and business operations since she joined.
"When I walked in here, it was unclear whether the company could survive," she said.

After Vice Media secured a new round of financing in 2017 that valued the company at $5.7 billion, Shane Smith, one of its founders, teased the potential for “hockey stick” growth and a “sexy” stock market debut.
But that once-grandiose talk at Vice has run into reality. The media company, which has undergone several rounds of staff cuts in recent years, is putting itself up for sale in a rocky media market — where it will almost certainly fetch much less than executives had once hoped for.
Nancy Dubuc, the CEO hired in 2018 to replace Smith after a reckoning over workplace sexual harassment, said that the company had “turned a corner” and that she and the company’s investors had decided to sell to a company that could help it grow.
“Has it been difficult?,” Dubuc said of the company’s travails in an interview. “Yeah. Has anybody in my chair had a difficult ride at any company? I would say yes. We tend to be a little bit more public than most because of the curiosities and palace intrigue. But I’m about getting a job done, and we have a job to do, and I intend to do it.”

In Their 20s, Struggling to Save and Tired of Being Lectured About It

Shea German-Tanner tries to put a portion of her paycheck, even if it is only $50, into her savings account. But most of the time, she has to reroute the cash back to her checking to afford her expenses. German-Tanner, 22, has about $600 in her savings account right now and has not started saving for retirement.
“Everyone’s telling you to save money and do this and invest, and I feel like I can’t do that because I’m living paycheck to paycheck,” said German-Tanner, a social worker in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who makes about $40,000 a year. She said she felt that inflation had impeded her ability to save money.
Young people who are just starting to get their footing as they enter adulthood are grappling with how to balance their incomes and spending priorities so they have money left over to save for emergencies and retirement. Worrying about saving has always been hard for 20-somethings who begin their careers at the bottom of their earning potential. But saving is especially difficult right now because on top of student debt, housing and food costs remain high even as inflation has started to cool.
German-Tanner said 20-somethings were often encouraged to take financial steps such as build emergency funds, save for retirement and pay off debt. They’re advised to invest when the market is down and to start thinking about their futures as early as possible. The FIRE movement (an acronym for “financial independence, retire early”) has been glorified in recent articles, and videos about budgeting and saving in Roth IRAs have taken over TikTok.
“I feel like the older generation is constantly pushing you to do stuff like they did when they were in their 20s, but it’s not even comparable to when they were in their 20s,” German-Tanner said.
Theresa Fairless, a 25-year-old project manager in Aberdeen, New Jersey, said paying off student loans was her priority. Fairless graduated from college in 2018 with about $25,900 in government loans and $50,000 in personal loans. So far, she has paid off all her personal loans and has about $23,000 left to pay off in government loans because she has not been making payments during the student loan pause period.
“I was the first person I knew who had to deal with loans,” Fairless said.
She had lived at home since she graduated, and recently moved in with her boyfriend in an apartment nearby, but he is paying a larger share of the rent than she is because he makes more money. Fairless, who makes about $65,000 a year, also gives money to her mother each month since her father died recently and her mother does not have savings.
When Fairless was living at home, she gave her mother $300 a month. Now, she gives her $200. She also saves about $160 a month for retirement in a 401(k) plan, puts $100 in a stock portfolio and tries to save $50 to $200 in a savings account.
“I always wanted my emergency fund to be at $10,000,” she said. “I have it there, and I feel like I need it to be more. I honestly feel like I’m not just saving for myself — I’m saving for my mom because I know she doesn’t have one.”
For Thea Pham, a first-generation Vietnamese immigrant, sending money to her family is also a priority. Pham, 27, lives in Los Angeles with her husband. Pham works in finance and was unable to disclose exactly how much she makes because of regulations around her job, but she said most people in her position earned from $160,000 to $250,000 annually. She also has a TikTok account with more than 450,000 followers, where she posts about mental health issues. Pham acknowledges she has achieved financial stability but said she did not have the flexibility to spend like friends with similar high incomes because of cultural expectations that she support her family in Vietnam.
“The majority of my paychecks are actually sent home to my family,” Pham said. “I didn’t know Americans don’t do that and how abnormal it is.”
Pham said most of her husband’s paychecks went toward paying their housing and living expenses, to which she contributes up to 20%. Any remaining money she makes goes into retirement and investment accounts, expenses such as travel or when relatives ask for money.
Kathia Ramirez, 24, is juggling several part-time jobs while she prepares to enroll in college. Ramirez, who lives in Bensenville, Illinois, in a house with her mother, sister and nephew, dropped out of school during the pandemic because she did not want to take classes online.
“I love living at home,” Ramirez said. “It does help me save money. I have a really good relationship with my family.”
Between her gigs at a Mexican seafood restaurant, editing videos for social media and entering data for a manufacturing company, Ramirez said she earns roughly $2,000 a month, though her income varies based on tips and how much she works. She saves $200 to $300 a month in a savings account. Otherwise, she spends money on groceries, gas and clothing. She hasn’t thought about saving for retirement.
Zach Teutsch, a financial planner and managing partner at Values Added Financial, suggested that young people focus on big spending choices instead of small luxuries such as coffee or a subscription.
“Big decisions matter a whole lot more than small decisions,” Teutsch said. “Contrary to some of the advice out there, most 20-somethings should worry more about jobs, housing, transportation and less about lattes and Netflix.”
Teutsch said the time spent worrying about a small purchase could be better devoted to figuring out how to navigate your company’s 401(k) plan. He also emphasized the importance of building an emergency fund to cover unforeseen expenses. While many financial advisers suggest having three to six months of expenses saved, even $100 can “make a huge difference,” he said.
For young people, Teutsch said, it is a good idea to start self-educating on personal finance and talk about financial issues with friends or engage on social media and share how you save money.
“This is a great time to learn more about money and find unbiased educational sources,” he said.
Haley Persichitte, a 24-year-old in Denver, makes fitness and exercise a priority and spends money on Barry’s Bootcamp, CorePower Yoga and a ClassPass subscription. She has a monthly car payment and rent, and also likes to go out to dinner with her friends. Persichitte did not go to college and works as a house manager for a family nearby. She manages to save about $600 a month, mostly for emergencies. Persichitte has saved about $15,000 so far, though she said high food and gas prices had made it harder to save recently. Saving for retirement, she said, “hasn’t crossed my mind.”
Brian Teitelbaum, 28, has taken many of what he feels are the right financial steps: He has an emergency fund, has started investing money and contributes to both a 401(k) and a Roth IRA. Teitelbaum earns about $90,000 a year as a project manager in New York City, and he tries to use the subway and cooks at home to save money. His monthly rent is $1,650, and he spends around $300 a month on groceries. He said he had not noticed inflation as much as people outside New York might but that he paid attention to high prices at the grocery store.
Teitelbaum does not have any student debt and saves about $2,000 a month. He puts about $600 a month into his 401(k), $500 into his Roth IRA and between $800 and $900 in investment accounts. Teitelbaum said automatically depositing portions of his paycheck into different savings accounts had helped him.
“I think my favorite thing about finance nowadays is auto deposit,” he said.
Teitelbaum also emphasized the importance of talking about money with family members. He said that he owed his father for providing him with much of his personal finance knowledge and that friends from families who didn’t talk about money did not have as much financial literacy.

In Love With a Love Story in India, for 27 Years: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Well past the film's intermission, the crowd keeps trickling in. Some pay at the ticketing window with a couple of taps on their phone; others dump fistfuls of coins. They are students and office clerks, prostitutes from the waning red-light district nearby, day laborers still chasing dreams in India's "maximum city," and the homeless with dreams long deferred.
India's film industry puts about 1,500 stories on the screen annually. But the audience that files every morning into the Maratha Mandir cinema in Mumbai is here for a movie that premiered 27 years ago -- and has resonated so intensely that this once-grand 1,100-seat theater has played it every day since, save for a pandemic hiatus.
The film, "Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge" -- which translates as "The Big-Hearted Will Take the Bride" and is known as "D.D.L.J." -- is a boy-meets-girl story set against the backdrop of a moment of immense change and unbridled possibility in India.
The Indian economy had just opened up, bringing new opportunities, new technologies and new exposure to a rising middle class. But it also brought new strains, as the choices afforded by economic opportunity -- to decide your own love and your own life -- ran up against the protective traditions of old.
In many ways, the India of today looks like the India reflected in the movie. The economy is still on the rise, and it is now about 10 times the size it was in the mid-1990s. A technological revolution, this one digital, has opened new worlds. Women are seeking more freedom in a male-dominated society. And the forces of modernity and conservatism remain in tension as an ascendant political right wing appoints itself the enforcer of conventional values.
The sense of unlimited possibility, however, has receded. As the early rewards of liberalization peaked and economic inequities deepened, aspirations of mobility have diminished. For those left behind, the world of "D.D.L.J." -- its story and stars, its music and dialogue -- is an escape. For those still striving, it is an inspiration. And for those who have made it, it is a time capsule, the starting point of India's transformation.
"It grew and grew and grew and went on to, you know, become an heirloom," said the actress Kajol, 48, who played the female lead, Simran, in the film. "I have had so many people who told me that, you know, we have made our children sit down and watch 'D.D.L.J.,' we have made our grandchildren sit down and watch -- and I was like, there are grandchildren now?"
She burst out laughing. "Children I am fine with. But grandchildren?"
When the pandemic closed theaters for a year, many speculated that "D.D.L.J.'s" record run would end. But the film is back on for its 11:30 a.m. slot at Maratha Mandir, often drawing crowds larger than those at afternoon screenings of the latest releases.
Some of those who show up have watched it here so many times that they have lost count -- 50, 100, hundreds.
A taxi driver who was in the line outside the theater one morning this fall had seen it six times, a welder about a dozen. A gray-bearded merchant of secondhand goods claimed about 50 viewings, the same for a 33-year-old delivery worker.
Then there were the regular regulars, those who trek here nearly every day. Madhu Sudan Varma, a 68-year-old homeless man who has a part-time job feeding neighborhood cats, comes about 20 mornings a month.
The woman with her head wrapped in a plastic bag?
"I come every day," she said. "I like it every day."
No one knows her real name -- it may be Jaspim, but even she is unsure. It doesn't matter, because everyone calls her by the name she prefers: Simran, just like the star on the screen.
Lying at night in the room she keeps as a prostitute in Kamathipura, Mumbai's red-light district, she sometimes dreams of the film's scenes, she says. In the morning, she makes sure she doesn't miss the show -- not even on this day when the henna she used to dye her graying hair hadn't yet dried. She would rather come wearing a plastic bag than not make it.
"I don't see any other films, just this one," she said. "I feel great when I come here. I get lost in the songs and dance."
'Live Your Life'
"D.D.L.J." is a love story. But it is also about compromise.
Kajol's character, Simran Singh, is brought up in London, though her father uses the income from the family's corner store to raise his children in the traditions of India.
On a European trip with friends, Simran meets Raj Malhotra, played by Shah Rukh Khan, a wealthy young man raised by a single father. The rest of the film's three hours are spent on the couple's efforts to persuade Simran's conservative father to let go of the arranged marriage he had planned for his daughter and bless their union.
"Go, Simran, go," the father declares at the end, after the film barrels through tears, bloody fistfights and many songs of longing. "Live your life."
Kajol said that the movie's middle path had broken new ground. Before "D.D.L.J.," she said, "we only had films that talked about either this way or that -- either we had films that celebrated marriages and everybody was involved from uncles to aunties, or it was 'us against the world, we will fight it out, we will live together, die together.' I think 'D.D.L.J.' came up with a very simple thought -- to say that maybe we can walk a line."
When the movie was released in 1995, Kajol and Mr. Khan were both relative newcomers. Kajol went on to become one of the most successful actresses in Hindi cinema. Mr. Khan, 57, found even greater fame, becoming one of India's most recognizable faces.
Both actors benefited from an Indian entertainment industry that was itself in transition, as money flooded in with the country's economic liberalization.
Now, the country has over 200 million households with televisions, up from 50 million then. Many more people can afford cinema tickets. And India, which recently became the world's fifth-largest economy, is expected to have one billion smartphone users by 2026.
Film stars have become permanent fixtures on billboards and on television commercials. India is a huge market -- it is projected to soon pass China as the world's most populous country -- and a star's simple post of sponsored content on platforms like Instagram can be lucrative. Actors who would once perform in different films in the same change of clothes now find themselves with unfathomable wealth.
Every day, fans throng outside Mr. Khan's seaside home in Mumbai, the heart of India's film industry, hoping for a sighting. Buses passing the road in front of his house slow down so passengers can take selfies.
On his birthday, thousands gather, waiting and chanting for Mr. Khan -- and he does not disappoint. He climbs up a caged platform, throwing kisses at the fans, before breaking into what has become his signature move: a leaned-back spread of the arms.
Bollywood has long favored those with legacy and family ties. Mr. Khan resonates as an outsider, a child of middle-class struggle in Delhi who lost both of his parents when he was young.
The towering residence he now occupies with his family "is a middle-class monument to a man who didn't own property," said the Indian economist Shrayana Bhattacharya. "He became this prism and this concept. He represents this idea of mobility."
Ms. Bhattacharya wrote a book, "Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh," about how Mr. Khan symbolizes the possibilities that only India's liberalized economy could produce, and what he has meant to young working women as he has challenged perceptions of masculinity in Indian cinema.
Taking advantage of new channels of information, he has built an image of an empathetic partner who listens, helps with household chores and shares the spotlight with female co-stars.
The power of this image, he said in one interview, has become such that he has become "an employee of the myth of Shah Rukh Khan." It is so potent that young women, Ms. Bhattacharya said, "want to be him" rather than want to "marry him," the emotion usually associated with older matinee idols.
To some women, Mr. Khan -- or at least his persona -- is a reminder of the ways Indian men have not changed. Surbhi Bhatia, a data and development researcher in Mumbai, said she often binge-watched his talks as an antidote to the restrictive male energy around her. If she is feeling low or uncertain, she strolls down to linger outside his seaside residence.
"You know when he spreads those arms," she said about Mr. Khan's signature move, "there is space to just go in."
In many ways, women have yet to achieve the economic promise of the new India. Only about a quarter of women participate in the work force, less than half the rate of all other major economies.
For women who have found economic opportunity, society has been slow to accept their independence. Having their own incomes -- or even just a smartphone -- has translated into some new freedom. But when a husband comes into the picture, Ms. Bhatia said, it brings another layer of permission and the forfeiture of leisure hours to household chores.
"The phone has done so much to give access, but not solved the larger problem," she said. "It's making us more lonely."
India is still trying to decide where to set the line that "D.D.L.J." suggested it walk between conservatism and modernity. Added to the tension is a Hindu-first fervor under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with Muslims in particular becoming a target. Mr. Khan, despite his crosscutting appeal, has not been spared.
This month, right-wing groups vandalized cinemas promoting Mr. Khan's latest film after a trailer showed its female star, Deepika Padukone, wearing a saffron bikini. The groups called the choice of saffron an offense to Hinduism, which is closely associated with the color.
Mr. Khan is a product of a secular India -- a Muslim who attended a Christian school and married a Hindu. Faced with attacks like these, he has largely stopped commenting on the country's political direction.
"I am a Muslim, my wife is a Hindu and my kids are Hindustan," Mr. Khan said on a television show in 2020, using another word for India. "When they went to school, they had to write their religion. My daughter came to me once and asked, 'What is our religion?' I simply wrote in her form that we are Indian."
'Love Doesn't End'
At the Maratha Mandir cinema, the logic of keeping one film running for nearly three decades is simple economics: New films could be hit or miss, but the crowd for "D.D.L.J." is steady.
"This picture is evergreen," said Manoj Desai, the cinema's 72-year-old executive director, "because it tells the story of true love. Because love doesn't end."
The theater's position near two transportation hubs ensures constant traffic. And it helps that the tickets are cheap: 30 rupees for downstairs seats and 40 for those in the balcony, or about 40 to 50 cents, a quarter of the price for admission to new releases.
"Three hours in air-conditioning, 40 rupees. Who will refuse that?" Mr. Desai said.
The interview with Mr. Desai was interrupted by frequent phone calls, including one from his wife. "Home minister," he said as he picked up her call.
He and his wife, who are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, went through a caste-based love struggle of their own, though with a different ending from the one in "D.D.L.J."
When her wealthy Jain parents refused Mr. Desai, a Gujarati Brahmin, they eloped and made their marriage official in a faraway temple. Her family kept looking for them for two years, trying to register her as a minor to charge Mr. Desai with kidnapping.
"Love has changed in the sense that breakups are easy," Mr. Desai lamented.
As he spoke, reporters called to inquire about a recent storm Mr. Desai had kicked up. In a scathing video interview, he had called a rising star "arrogant" for talking about taking his films directly to streaming services. The star was sent by his father on a private jet to Mr. Desai's office to touch his feet and apologize.
With Hindi cinema struggling to regain momentum after its pandemic lull, many producers and stars have opted to take their films directly to streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon.
To purists like Mr. Desai, the growing trend is blasphemy. "There is the money, but sirrrrr," he said, stretching and rolling his "r." "What about theater? What about the big screen?"
For the entire time that "D.D.L.J." has been showing on Mr. Desai's big screen, Jagjivan Maru has been the projectionist. He will soon retire after 50 years.
When he sets up the day's show, staff downstairs change into their uniforms, prepare the popcorn and samosas in the dimly lit corner concession stand and mop the marble floor between the rows of worn-out seats.
"For 10 years, the hall would be full -- there would queues for tickets," he said about the film's release in 1995. "After 10 years, it cooled off a bit -- but the passion hasn't died."
As customers line up to enter the theater, the guards frisking them and checking their bags repeat one reminder: "Don't put your feet on the seats." They know it's futile, because many come precisely for that -- to escape the city's heat, to put up their feet.
Mr. Varma, the 68-year-old homeless man, arrives at the ticket counter with his two bags of belongings, containing a blanket, some changes of clothes and his water bottle.
He sleeps in a parked auto rickshaw near a Buddha statue. Waking before dawn, he feeds about 50 neighborhood cats, for which an NGO pays him 100 rupees -- roughly $ 1.30 -- a day.
He worked in the family's furniture upholstery business before a dispute forced him to the streets. He has lost everyone dear in his life, from his siblings to his parents.
But one person resurfaced about 15 years ago: an unrequited love that had left him a bachelor. Caste differences made their union impossible, just as they prevent many love stories even today. The woman got married in 1984 and went on to have children who are now married.
The rekindling is one of friendship. They speak by phone once a month; he asks about her life, her children, and she asks if he is eating well.
"There were others who would call in the past," Mr. Varma said. "There is no one else now."
Mr. Varma takes his seat on the ground floor of the cinema hall. In the row in front of him is Simran, the prostitute.
When the movie's wildly popular songs come on, Simran shimmies in her seat, singing along and getting up to dance in the aisle. She mimics the dialogue. And when the Simran on the screen waves goodbye to Raj, the Simran in the theater also waves her hand in goodbye.
Every time the light from the screen reflects on Mr. Varma's face, he is lounged in his seat, his soft eyes glued to the film.
"I find peace here," Mr. Varma said. "I get a little calm."

This Endless Waiting Game Can Wear You Down: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Catherine, Princess of Wales, seems to live in a state of perpetual waiting. What does that do to a woman?
Prince Harry's blockbuster memoir, "Spare," has dragged the royal family back into international focus with details at once banal and intriguing. Kate Middleton, as she is still sometimes known to those of us who remember her before her royal marriage, figures in the memoir and the Netflix documentary "Harry & Meghan" as a sketch of steely disapproval and emotional coolness.
It is true that Catherine, Princess of Wales, seems poised in perpetual expectation, a real-life version of the fairy tale princesses who must wait stoically (some sweeping, some sleeping) until their prince finds and marries them. When she was the pretty young woman who dated Prince William for nearly 10 years (including a brief breakup) before becoming engaged, the British tabloids cruelly nicknamed her "Wait-y Katie."
No one of course imagined that William might be the one doing the waiting. No, fairy tales, monarchies and, frankly, conventional heterosexual courtship practices to this day dictate that women wait to be chosen. And pop culture narratives from Cinderella (which dates to the 17th century) to "The Bachelor" reconfirm this constantly. Women wait for marriage to reward their beauty, charm or virtue. And so it finally came to pass for Catherine Middleton.
But for Kate, being engaged meant simply replacing one type of waiting with another, as she entered her next highly public stage: anticipating the wedding. Media coverage of this period focused on her royal transformation -- her passage from an athletic-looking young woman with an infectious grin and tumbling wavy hair into an impossibly slender, impeccably coifed, swan-like creature. Her beauty grew ethereal, with no visual disruptions or irregularities left to catch the gaze: hair smooth, body sleek, smile distant.
Magazines speculated about Kate's austere slimming diet and the elocution lessons intended to posh-ify her accent. Yet those newly refined tones remained a mystery, because Kate rarely spoke in public. She became an object of purely visual fascination -- a liminal being hovering on the threshold of the marriage she, and the entire world, still awaited.
Fairy princess stories end with weddings. The blank "they lived happily ever after" is all we ever get as a description of postnuptial royal life. So, how to fill this void? In Catherine's case, the media crafted a story of still more waiting: When would she conceive an heir to the throne? Then, when can we see the baby? Then, when is the next baby?
She obliged, smiling calmly through three (famously difficult) pregnancies that barely seemed to alter her sylph-like form, re-emerging each time, a polished, camera-ready Madonna with child on the steps of London's St. Mary's Hospital.
As a mother and wife, she has continued to telegraph control and studiously maintained patience. Even when encountering the kind of disruption that might try a mother's temper, like a public tantrum by young Prince Louis, her gracious demeanor never falters.
She seems to find self-expression through one medium, though: photography. The princess is such a fine photographer, in fact, that Buckingham Palace sometimes distributes her family portraits to the media. They're good pictures. They're also clear evidence of how thoroughly she has internalized the idealized gaze that the palace prefers to train on the royals.
With the death of Queen Elizabeth and Charles's ascension to the throne, Catherine enters yet another stage of public waiting -- this time, the wait to be queen -- a possibly decades-long slog that will likely require still greater levels of self-control. Even more than a princess, a queen must hold herself apart from regular human life, remaining more symbol than woman.
Royal protocol constrains men too, of course. But princes and kings enjoy greater latitude; they play polo, join the army, fly helicopters and wear military regalia for most official occasions. All this lends them an aura of vitality and action. But for centuries, the most spectacular -- and media worthy -- trappings of royalty have dwelled in the world of the feminine: jewels and crowns and fine fashion, things we associate with women. Women are the showpieces that make the monarchy watchable. Recent weeks have proven the exception to the rule though, as the telegenic Prince Harry set the media aflame.
Harry's most discussed revelations about Catherine may seem inconsequential: She supposedly upset Meghan by being reluctant to lend her a lip gloss. Catherine reacted angrily when Meghan suggested she may be suffering from "baby brain" during pregnancy. And then there's Catherine's famous purported rage over the flower girls' dresses for Meghan's wedding, which allegedly reduced Meghan to tears.
Yet a pattern emerges here: All these contretemps involve Catherine trying to exert some kind of bodily control in the face of perceived transgressions. Sharing lip gloss, admitting to hormonal changes, even ceding authority on the matter of a dress -- these all require letting down her guard and sharing some form of bodily intimacy, whether an item that touches her body (lip gloss), an intimate fact (hormonal fluctuations) or maternal control over something that touches her child's body (the dress).
In all cases, she resisted, striving instead to assert dominion over her (and her daughter's) body. It is behavior consistent with the extreme self-containment that distinguishes her public image.
In a way, the British monarchy is a perpetual performance of the refusal or shunting aside of various realities -- the reality of human bodies and, especially, the reality of power's darker side, including the machinations, manipulations and betrayals (not to mention the violence of imperial conquests) that built and sustain one of the richest families in the world.
The public spectacle of royalty is like a swan we see gliding serenely on a lake. But the private, usually unseen side consists of those webbed feet below, furiously churning in the water. One half cannot exist without the other. Perhaps Harry and Meghan's bombshells help balance out the family, serving as those pedaling feet. By tacitly agreeing to represent chaos they permit the others to seem calm and unruffled by comparison. And the calmest of all, the smoothest and most unperturbed of swans is Catherine, still silently gliding toward the future -- the ever-waiting princess.

Asking Readers, Twice, About Leaving Their Jobs: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: A series on quitting was a hit. But as some readers pointed out, it failed to address a few important concerns. Enter the follow-up series.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In the spring of 2022, as a surge in job departures was cresting in the United States (more than 40 million people left their jobs in 2021), the Special Projects team at The New York Times wanted to know how quitting had changed people's lives. So, we asked our readers in an online questionnaire -- and soon got our answer: Of the hundreds of responses, a majority of readers said that quitting had a positive effect on their well-being.
In August, we published three articles; each focused on a selection of those readers, and how quitting had affected their personal finances, work-life balance or relationships.
The series was a runaway hit. In the comments forum, hundreds of additional readers shared their stories, as well as what they believed the Great Resignation represented for the U.S. work force. "The larger story I see in this article is a society where the 40 hour a week grind just to survive isn't good for us humans," one reader wrote in a comment.
Others, however, criticized the series for overlooking or glossing over a few major factors involved in quitting -- or in not being able to quit. One reader asked: "Where are the tales about those who made a terrible mistake and now regret leaving their jobs? Where are the people who no longer have health insurance and are going bankrupt?" Others noted that the first two articles in the series did not include any subjects who were balancing work with parenthood. And though we did report on people who had become burned out in their jobs, we didn't address any specific fields in which burnout is perhaps most likely.
The criticisms were valid -- and got us thinking. So we crafted a second solicitation, hoping to address some of those concerns. We got more specific, asking about burnout, particularly for teachers and nurses. We addressed parents, asking them how parenting affected their decision to quit and what additional challenges it posed if they did.
It's not uncommon for the Special Projects team to solicit readers' thoughts, in part to help us craft articles like these. We've found that our digital audience is highly engaged -- many readers share comments on articles, for example -- and others are happy to share their stories. It's become a helpful supplement to more traditional reporting methods, and helps us include a wide variety of perspectives in our coverage.
The response to our second questionnaire was even more robust than it was the first time around. Nearly 1,000 readers wrote in, including dozens, if not hundreds, of teachers and nurses. Interestingly, though we are now approaching almost a year since the surge in quitting began, a majority of respondents were still extremely pleased with their decisions. One reader wrote in with a common sentiment -- that quitting has been a game changer.
The newer solicitation, in turn, spawned a follow-up series, titled Calling It Quits. The first article, which was published on Monday, revisited some of the subjects from the first series. How are they doing now? Are they still happy with their decision to quit? (Spoiler: They generally are.)
But we'll also focus on some of the themes we felt could use a deeper dive: Single parents. Teacher and nurse burnout. What happens when quitting isn't a panacea? How should both employees and companies assess job satisfaction? Is performative quitting online -- think TikTok and YouTube -- satisfying? A handful of future articles in the series will continue to explore the ripple effects of quitting.
We hope that the new series will have the same resonance with readers that the first one did -- and address some of their critiques.

A True War Story, an Indigenous Journey and More: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This month's picks include a Latvian satire about World War II, a family portrait by an Indian documentarian, an Oedipal thriller from Mexico and more.
The Sign Painter
Stream it on Tubi.
Set during World War II, "The Sign Painter" tells a dark, real-life history with bracing irony and fairy-tale whimsy. Ansis, a sign painter in rural Latvia, lives through three regime changes in the span of a decade, each reflected in the hues he's asked to color official buildings and signs with: green is favored by the dictatorship of Karlis Ulmanis, red by the Soviet occupation, and black by the Nazi invasion that follows.
Like the slightly canted angle that the director Viesturs Kairiss uses throughout the film, this playful conceit offers an off-kilter perspective on the past, emphasizing the tragic absurdity of human brutality. Ansis, played by Davis Suharevskis with an aura of wide-eyed purity, maintains a principled if diffident innocence throughout, while his two lady loves -- the forthright Jewish comrade, Zisele (Brigita Cmuntova), and the sweet, sly Latvian Christian girl, Naiga (Agnese Cirule) -- act as his strong-willed foils. The slapstick of the film's first half, replete with painting accidents, petty jealousies and romantic high jinks, gives way to bloody scenes of war and displacement in the second, making for a gutting tonal seesaw that Kairiss executes with finesse.
About Love
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Archana Phadke's intimate diary-doc opens with the filmmaker and her sister in a car, driving toward their house in South Bombay. Shiny skyscrapers loom on the horizon; their squat, worn building, home to their clan since 1902, marks a contrast, nestled within a crowded complex astir with chatter and dust. Old and new commingle in the Phadke house, where three generations of the family live in noisy, prickly coexistence. Archana observes their daily goings-on with a curious, slightly defiant eye; she loves her ancestral, history-laden home but balks at the traditions that continue to bind it.
As her relatives prepare for her brother's wedding, she suffers frequent nagging about her own reluctance to marry; her wariness, she reveals, comes from the complicated, loving, yet often rancorous marital dynamic of her parents and her grandparents. Her film gently zeros in on the patriarchal trappings of her family but never flattens her loved ones into didactic archetypes; her patient, affectionate gaze captures them in all their complexity. With its portrait of the kind of middle-class, multigenerational abode that's increasingly rare in growing cities like Mumbai, "About Love" feels like a microcosmic epic, an entire world captured in a grain of sand.
Compañía
Stream it on the Media City Film Festival website.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Venture beyond your usual streaming hide-outs this month and sample some of the treasures in "ThousandSuns Cinema: Indigenous Edition," a free online series hosted by the Media City Film Festival and copresented with Cousin, an artist-run collective supporting Indigenous filmmakers. The series rounds up an eclectic variety of films made by Indigenous artists from around the world. One recommendation from among its many gems: "Compañía," by the German-born filmmaker Miguel Hilari, who is of Aymara descent. A trance-like visual odyssey driven more by rhythm and sound than by narrative, this mesmerizing documentary revolves around an Indigenous community in Bolivia whose members journey from the city to their ancestral village in the Andes Mountains to celebrate a festival honoring their dead.
Hilari weaves together evocative, fog-shrouded shots of the natural landscape and close, tactile scenes of the community's everyday urban lives with snippets of interviews in which various individuals recount stories of death and migration -- so that both kinds of departure become parallel, flecked by loss, grief, hope and more. Like several other films in the series, "Compañía" is as much a document of a community's rituals as it is a kind of ritual in itself, a gesture of preservation and remembrance in the face of rapid change.
Summer White
Stream it on Ovid.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A classic Oedipal triangle -- mother, son, and mother's new boyfriend -- forms the simmering heart of Rodrigo Ruiz Patterson's taut Mexico City--set feature. The unsettlingly intimate relationship between Valeria (Sophie Alexander-Katz), a young, divorced mother, and her 13-year-old son, Rodrigo (Adrián Ross), is evident in opening scenes that show them sleeping in the same bed, then brushing their teeth together, naked. When Valeria starts bringing home a new beau named Fernando (Fabián Corres), the pensive Rodrigo -- who likes to cut school, smoke cigarettes and beat up used cars -- seems primed to act out.
But "Summer White" stalls the inevitable with some surprising twists: As it turns out, Fernando is friendly and kind, with a paternal tenderness that both touches and frustrates Rodrigo. The mother-son relationship recedes to the background, and Rodrigo and Fernando's tense, shifting dynamic comes to the fore, made unpredictable by the erratic emotional currents of adolescent boyhood. Refusing easy lines of sympathy and black-and-white morals, "Summer White" turns a familiar narrative into an engrossing, unnerving tightrope walk of a film.
God's Crooked Lines
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The twists arrive a mile a minute in this lavishly directed, elaborately plotted thriller by the Spanish director Oriol Paulo. Set in the 1970s, the film knits together the tropes of many a detective mystery -- a slippery femme fatale; a psychiatric hospital buzzing with secrets; a private detective with tricks up her sleeve -- into a continually surprising narrative of fickle allegiances and blurry truths.
Things are not quite what they seem right from the beginning, when the elegant, dyed-blonde heiress Alice Gould (Bárbara Lennie) arrives at an asylum; she brings with her a doctor's letter warning of her penchant for lying and accusing her of having tried to poison her husband. Alice claims the opposite -- that her husband tried to kill her for her fortune -- but soon suggests that her entire story might be a grand red herring; apparently, she's a for-hire investigator who's entered the institution to find the truth about a mysterious recent death.
The haunting camerawork, beguiling performances from an ensemble cast and endless cascade of revelations and flashbacks ensures, however, that nothing is certain. Is Alice caught up in her own delusional fantasies, or is she a victim of an elaborate gaslighting scheme? This is a pulpy affair that shocks and entertains, while also reckoning with the often draconian ways in which the state and medical establishments handle mental illness.

MELBOURNE, Australia — Nick Kyrgios is finally home.
He is in Australia, with his people and in the place he longs for during all those homesick months living out of a suitcase on the professional tennis road.
For months, he soaked up the sun and trained in Sydney. But he also squeezed in a bit of time, although never enough for his liking, on the black couch in his childhood home in Canberra, Australia’s quiet, rural capital, telling his mother how safe he feels while she drinks tea a few feet away in the kitchen. He could sleep in his old room, where his cherished collection of colorful basketball shoes lines the shelves. That is next to the room with hundreds of his trophies and plaques and dozens of his smashed rackets. His pet macaw is in an aviary out back. Mornings bring brisk, 12-kilometer (7.5-mile) walks with his father, his golden retriever King and his miniature Dachshund Quincy, up nearby Mount Majura.
He hit balls, and lifted weights, goofed around with and gave endless swag to the children at the tennis center in Lyneham where he got his start. Like many in Australia — and lots of other places these days — they worship their local folk hero, no matter how boorish and aggressive he can be in the heat of competition, or when a live microphone appears at his chin. Or maybe that’s why they do.
Now though, everything is suddenly different.
Last year, Kyrgios evolved from a temperamental talent with so much unrealized potential into the kind of transcendent showman that this supposedly genteel sport offers up every so often — the gifted bad boy who drives the tennis establishment mad but enthralls crowds in the late stages of the most important championships.
Whether the tennis establishment likes it or not, no one in the sport fills a stadium like Kyrgios these days. Even his doubles matches have become raucous, packed affairs. And as the Australian Open gets underway, Kyrgios, 27, is among the favorites to challenge nine-time champion Novak Djokovic for his home Slam, which may be the ultimate double-edged sword. That level of pressure and expectation has been kryptonite for Kyrgios before, his self-destructive psyche exploding at a crucial moment, producing his unique brand of irresistible tennis theater.
“It’s going to be a hard couple weeks, regardless of whether I win or lose, emotionally, mentally,” Kyrgios said in a pre-Christmas interview from his parents’ home. “I’m one of the players that has a scope lens on him all the time. Big target on my back.”
With all his recent success and notoriety, so much suddenly appears to be riding on Kyrgios. The game’s leaders see him as the rare player who can reach a new and younger audience. Fans raise their beers and bump chests as Kyrgios wins points with his signature trick shots through the legs and behind the back. They wear basketball jerseys when they watch him and when they play, just as he does, and they turn his matches, even the doubles contests, into the something like a rowdy night at a UFC bout.
“He brings something different,” said Andrea Gaudenzi, a former pro who is now the chair of the ATP Tour, the men’s professional circuit.
Ken Solomon, chair and CEO of the Tennis Channel, the sport’s leading media partner, called Kyrgios “ground zero” in efforts to attract fans who have never touched a racket and perhaps never will. On Friday, Netflix released “Break Point,” its documentary series on pro tennis that the sport hopes will do for it what “Drive to Survive” did for Formula One. The premiere episode focused almost exclusively on Kyrgios, who took a signature victory lap on Twitter.
Tennis Australia announced earlier last week that Kyrgios would play Djokovic in a charity exhibition Friday evening. Tickets sold out in 58 minutes.
Three hours before the match, he hobnobbed with the top clients of a luxury hotel chain during a promotional table tennis game. Before the event started, he sat alone in a quiet hallway, feeling the pressure of what lay ahead. Moments later, holding a racket in a packed rooftop bar, the bright eyes and big smile of the star entertainer emerged.
Leaning on Kyrgios as a pitchman for the game carries plenty of risk. What makes him so irresistible, that at any time he might produce another can’t-miss moment on the court, has at times made him a walking grenade. And he’s the one with a finger on the pin.
There is also the allegation of domestic violence.
In early February, Kyrgios is due in court in Canberra to face a charge of common assault stemming from an altercation with an ex-girlfriend, Chiara Passari, in December 2021. Kyrgios has declined to discuss the matter since it became public during his run to the Wimbledon final in July.
Common assault is the least serious assault charge in Australia, but it implies that the victim experienced immediate, unlawful violence, or the threat of it, although not bodily injury. Kyrgios’ lawyers have said that they will mount a defense focused on mental illness, citing his history of depression and substance abuse, struggles that Kyrgios has said will always be with him but that he now has under control. If the court accepts this defense and dismisses the case, it could then decide to impose a treatment plan. The maximum penalty for common assault is two years’ imprisonment.
The incident occurred during the first weeks of Kyrgios’ relationship with his now-constant companion, Costeen Hatzi, whom he met online. He had also just recommitted himself fully to tennis after years of ambivalence and mental turmoil. The sport had brought riches and fame but also loneliness, with its endless travel and solitary battles on the court, which tortured his psyche.
The withering criticism and racist attacks he endured when he lost matches that he was expected to win, or broke rackets and berated tennis officials, triggered memories of those years before a growth spurt at 17 turned him into a strapping, 6-foot-4 elite athlete. As an overweight boy with dark skin and modest means in an overwhelmingly white country where everyone seemed to have more, he was mocked and bullied, despite his talent for tennis, or maybe because of it.
Goran Ivanisevic, the Wimbledon champion who coaches Djokovic, has called Kyrgios a “tennis genius.” Kyrgios’ father, Giorgos, first noticed that skill when Kyrgios was a toddler hitting a ball hanging on a string from a metal pole. He never missed. Soon Kyrgios was learning the sport on dilapidated courts near his parents’ home in Canberra. His father, a house painter from Greece, would hit a bucket of balls with him after work.
“Still wears the same overalls he walked off the boat in,” Kyrgios said of his father, who still paints houses. “He must have been exhausted.”
His mother, Norlaila, who is from Malaysia and worked as a software engineer for health care organizations, would drive for hours to get him and his brother to tournaments. They stayed at backpacker hostels and tried to stretch $20 to cover dinner for him and his siblings at cheap Indian restaurants in the countryside.
His parents knew next to nothing about tennis. Tennis Australia and the tennis authority for his provincial region worked to fill in the gaps, and Kyrgios notched his breakthrough win at 19, when he upset Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2014.
It nearly ruined him. After that win and all the expectations it produced, Kyrgios thought he had to solve every problem on his own. When he couldn’t, he lashed out, at tennis officials, the media and the people around him.
Then, last fall, after a year in which he flirted with quitting but also showed flickers of his magical game, Kyrgios began to realize he didn’t have to do it all alone. He could talk about his fears and insecurities and the fragility of his mind to the people closest to him, and they could help.
“Knowing that I am not alone anymore and I can kind of open up and talk to people, now that’s a big one for me,” he said. “It’s OK to, you know, feel like having to cry some days.”
He also decided he was tired of letting himself and others down. Before last year’s Australian Open, he embarked on the kind of solid six-week training block he had not done in years. He played with top opponents for 90 minutes each day and hit the weight room. He spent two hours several times a week playing full-court basketball, his true love, with top Australian players to hone his conditioning.
Asked for a scouting report on his hoops game, he put it like this:
“Loves shooting mid-rangers,” “Can shoot a three-ball pretty good,” “Play like a wing,” “In the corner,” “Come off picks,” “Pretty versatile,” “Can guard a big,” “Pretty physical,” “Like Tobias Harris in his prime.”
He also ate better, and he focused on getting more rest instead of more drinks.
By the end of January, with Thanasi Kokkinakis, his countryman and childhood friend, he had won the doubles title for his first Grand Slam championship. Then he mostly stuck to the healthier living through Wimbledon, where he once had to be dragged from a pub at 4 a.m. on the morning of a match. Not this time, although his sublime tennis did come with multiple confrontations with chair umpires and a tense verbal sparring match with Stefanos Tsitsipas during which Tsitsipas tried to hit Kyrgios with a ball.
He fell to Djokovic in the final in four sets, but he remained disciplined through the U.S. Open. There, he obliterated the top seed and defending champion, Daniil Medvedev, in the fourth round before suffering an upset loss to Karen Khachanov of Russia in the quarterfinals. Exhausted from the season and from playing mostly at night so broadcasters could maximize the television audience, he caught the first flight home and played just one more singles tournament.
Kyrgios will play Roman Safiullin, an unheralded Russian, in the first round Tuesday.
What happens now?
Tennis, like few other sports, is an MRI of the soul. Kyrgios knows he will never pursue the game with the clinical efficiency and emotional discipline that Nadal and Djokovic have showcased for so long. He is going to throw and break rackets. It’s a manifestation of how much he cares, he said, and for him to thrive, tennis has to be about who he is, someone who plays with emotion, instinct and improvisation, like a jazz solo rather than a symphony.
If he can do that, maybe he can find peace on the court, even when the pressure brings the stress of a near-explosion that keeps his mother, too worried about what will happen, from being able to watch.
“Not many people can say that they have become a Slam threat, they are going to have the support of the nation, well, the support of some of the nation behind him,” he said. “Just got to try to enjoy it.”
For Kyrgios, that has always been the toughest task of all. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: HBO's new post-apocalyptic series is based on a video game with tens of millions of fans. For them and for newcomers, here's what to expect.
The pop culture landscape is littered with bad adaptations of hit video games, from the notoriously awful 1993 film "Super Mario Bros." to the recently canceled series "Resident Evil," on Netflix. HBO hopes to buck that trend with its first, "The Last of Us," based on the wildly popular video game series about the survivors of a devastating pandemic. After years of being stuck in development purgatory as a potential movie, the adaptation has evolved into one of this winter's most hotly anticipated shows, starring Pedro Pascal ("The Mandalorian") and Bella Ramsey ("Game of Thrones").
Premiering on Sunday, the nine-episode first season largely follows the outline of the first PlayStation game, from 2013, which to date has sold over 20 million copies. New to the franchise? Here's what to know about the series before it debuts.
Hollywood purgatory
Developed by the video game company Naughty Dog, "The Last of Us" is a deeply cinematic game set after the collapse of civilization, caused by a parasitic fungus that turns people into brain-dead, flesh-ripping monsters. The game was an instant success -- a divisive 2020 sequel likewise sold millions -- and it was targeted for adaptation almost immediately.
In 2014, the production studio Screen Gems announced that it would be distributing a Sam Raimi-produced film version of the game, with Kaitlyn Dever and the "Game of Thrones" star Maisie Williams as early contenders to play the female lead. In 2016, the project stalled over creative disagreements about the tone of the film, with one of the lead developers of the game, Neil Druckmann, saying that he had wanted a movie resembling "No Country for Old Men" while the studio wanted "World War Z."
Then in March 2020, HBO announced it would be producing a series created by Druckmann and Craig Mazin, the creator of HBO's Emmy-winning "Chernobyl." Part zombie flick, part road picture, the result (based on an advance screening of the first nine episodes) is a bleak, post-apocalyptic television drama with echoes of "Children of Men," "The Road" and "The Walking Dead."
A frightening future, today
The bulk of Season 1 takes place in 2023, two decades after a heartbreaking prologue in which Joel (Pascal), a construction contractor and single father from Austin, sees his life fall apart and the pandemic take hold. By our present year, the world has been torn apart not only by the vicious creatures who were once human but also by a brutal military dictatorship. For everyone else, it's often kill or be killed.
In this dystopian future, where Boston has become a walled city, Joel meets a switchblade-wielding teenage girl named Ellie (Ramsey), who is being held captive by a rebel group known as the Fireflies. The Fireflies have discovered that Ellie is immune to the fungus and may, therefore, hold the key to humanity's survival. When Joel's brother, Tommy (Gabriel Luna), goes missing, Joel, who in this new world has become an intrepid smuggler, agrees to smuggle Ellie outside the walls. In exchange, the Fireflies give him the supplies he needs to search for his brother. Things go quickly wrong, and the cross-country journey begins.
Familiar faces (and sounds)
Most of the supporting characters in the HBO version of "The Last of Us" will be familiar to players of the game, including Joel's smuggling partner (and seeming romantic partner), Tess (Anna Torv), and the Fireflies leader Marlene (Merle Dandridge, who also voiced the character in the game). Fans of the game series will also recognize the brothers Henry (Lamar Johnson) and Sam (Keivonn Woodard); Ellie's former ally Riley (Storm Reid); and the malevolent David (Scott Shepherd), a cult leader with dark secrets of his own.
A few major characters, however, won't be so recognizable. Nick Offerman plays the familiar smuggler Bill, but his role in the series is very different. Another character named Frank, who is only a dead body in the game, is brought to life by Murray Bartlett in the series. A vicious revolutionary named Kathleen, played by Melanie Lynskey, is entirely new.
Mazin and Druckmann also found small onscreen roles for the game's main voice actors, including Troy Baker (who voices Joel in the game), Ashley Johnson (who voices Ellie) and Jeffrey Pierce (Tommy). Even the game's original composer, Gustavo Santaolalla, returns to do the TV score.
A faithful adaptation
The big question for fans of the video game is, how faithful will the series be to its source material? Early signs suggest the answer is "very," with the show including most of the major characters and plot points. It even incorporates material from the excellent expansion prequel to the game titled "Left Behind."
Without the action-first requirements of a video game, Druckmann and Mazin seem freed to deepen the dominant themes. As a result, the show tells an even more character-driven, grounded story about a broken man who is stuck in the past and the traumatized girl who forces him to rediscover his own humanity, equal partners in a symbiotic hero's journey. Joel has barely scraped by for 20 years when he meets Ellie, but she gives him reason to hope again, even as their road winds through unspeakable violence.
Unlike a lot of child-in-distress characters, Ellie is extremely tough; she grew up in this world, and her arc is as essential as Joel's. The game has been lauded for its diversity of characters in a medium often dominated by macho male protagonists, and that hasn't been lost in translation.

Full text: MELBOURNE, Australia -- Nick Kyrgios is finally home.
He is in Australia, with his people and in the place he longs for during all those homesick months living out of a suitcase on the professional tennis road.
For months, he soaked up the sun and trained in Sydney. But he also squeezed in a bit of time, though never enough for his liking, on the black couch in his childhood home in Canberra, Australia's quiet, rural capital, telling his mother how safe he feels while she drinks tea a few feet away in the kitchen.

For Kyrgios, that has always been the toughest task of all.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- I am, faith and begorrah, no monarchist.
Yet I found myself, over the last few years, exhausted by the exodus of Harry and Meghan, quitting palace life for the Netflix lobby, spilling secrets to accrue the gazillion that would be needed for a Vinyasa-and-Oprah lifestyle in Montecito.
If Meghan Markle wanted to change the world, couldn't she do it more effectively from within the monarchy, blowing the dust off old rituals, as she did with her wedding? How could Meghan be "shocked to discover institutional racism in the very institution that created the most enduring business model for it?," Alicia Montgomery wrote in Slate.
Couldn't Harry and Meghan rise above Rupert Murdoch and salacious tabloid coverage, as the Obamas rose above the vile coverage on Murdoch's Fox News? (And shouldn't the royals stop having the tabloids laid out with their breakfast?)
Harry thought he'd find closure in disclosure. He will never feel the crown's heaviness, but was his burden so unbearable that it needed multimedia unburdening? The family spats seemed sitcom-worthy, the drama as puffed up as a flower girl's dress. As someone who has maneuvered sibling friction over politics, I learned to bite my tongue so I could remain close to my siblings.
Couldn't the couple have played the inside game, as Diana did, more effectively torturing Harry's "villain," Camilla?
Now that I have read "Spare," however, these questions seem pointless. It's like asking Orestes, "Couldn't you just have made nice with your mother?"
The unfathomable 1997 accident in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris, the crash that extinguished Diana's radiance, a luminosity recalled so lovingly by her son in his memoir, turned the House of Windsor into the House of Atreus.
Much to the shock and discomfort of the royal family, Diana's death opened a flood of emotion for the stiff-upper-lip Brits, and Harry is determined to keep that torrent flowing and make sure his mother is avenged.
The book is about hunting and being hunted. Harry hunted for the Taliban in Afghanistan and game in Africa and Balmoral -- and love. When he killed a rabbit as a child, his nanny "blooded" him -- smeared the animal's blood on his forehead. When a teenage Harry killed a stag, his guide stuck his head in the carcass, giving him a "blood facial."
Harry often identifies with the quarry. Once, when he was high on weed at Eton, he saw a fox and felt more connected to it than to his classmates or his family. He loathes being hunted by what he terms the "sadists" from the tabloids, just as his mother was, to the point where he thinks both sanity and life are endangered, for him and Meghan.
This is a prince who needs a hug. He couldn't get one from his "Pa," who couldn't get one from his mother. (Maybe that's why Charles kept his tattered teddy bear into adulthood.) Harry's brother, preoccupied with primogeniture, often kept his affectionate younger brother at arm's length, oddly calling him "Harold" and earning a place as Harry's "arch nemesis."
So Harry married Meghan, a hugger, like his mother, and moved to hug-at-hello Southern California where a stranger like Tyler Perry offered up his L.A. compound to the homeless couple and A-listers welcomed the former "Suits" actress to their ranks.
I have to admit, if it were me, I would have put up with a lot to live through history, to see the end of the Elizabethan era. I would have loved to be bouncing over the Scottish highlands with the queen in her Land Rover, nursing a thermos of Scotch and hearing anything she had to say about anyone.
Harry, winningly self-deprecating in the book, recalls his moniker of "Prince Thicko" and concedes he was not literary. He feels intimidated that Meghan has read "Eat, Pray, Love." He is also so uninterested in history -- even though it was his own family he was studying -- that a teacher presented him with a wooden ruler engraved with the names of every British monarch since 1066. When he got a chance to chat with his great-grandmother, he did not quiz Gan-Gan about her illustrious and notorious relatives. He taught her how to say "Booyakasha," Ali G-style.
He couldn't get into Shakespeare, despite his father's love of the Bard. "I opened Hamlet," Harry wrote. "Hmmm: Lonely prince, obsessed with dead parent, watches remaining parent fall in love with dead parent's usurper ...? I slammed it shut. No, thank you." Harry is not an intellectual, like Hamlet, although he is aggrieved and obsessed with his mother and following what he thinks are the desires of his parent's ghost, even if it leads to a collapse of the court.
Harry's internal struggle was not "To be or not to be" but "To split or not to split." He split, he spilled and now, as at the end of all Shakespearean tragedies, the stage is covered in blood and littered with bodies.
Harry told a Telegraph writer that it could have been worse and that he left out a lot of damaging material about his father and brother. He is just, he said, "trying to save them from themselves."

MELBOURNE, Australia — Nick Kyrgios is finally home.
He is in Australia, with his people and in the place he longs for during all those homesick months living out of a suitcase on the professional tennis road.
For months, he soaked up the sun and trained in Sydney. But he also squeezed in a bit of time, although never enough for his liking, on the black couch in his childhood home in Canberra, Australia’s quiet, rural capital, telling his mother how safe he feels while she drinks tea a few feet away in the kitchen. He could sleep in his old room, where his cherished collection of colorful basketball shoes lines the shelves. That is next to the room with hundreds of his trophies and plaques and dozens of his smashed rackets. His pet macaw is in an aviary out back. Mornings bring brisk, 12-kilometer (7.5-mile) walks with his father, his golden retriever King and his miniature Dachshund Quincy, up nearby Mount Majura.
He hit balls, and lifted weights, goofed around with and gave endless swag to the children at the tennis center in Lyneham where he got his start. Like many in Australia — and lots of other places these days — they worship their local folk hero, no matter how boorish and aggressive he can be in the heat of competition, or when a live microphone appears at his chin. Or maybe that’s why they do.
Now though, everything is suddenly different.
Last year, Kyrgios evolved from a temperamental talent with so much unrealized potential into the kind of transcendent showman that this supposedly genteel sport offers up every so often — the gifted bad boy who drives the tennis establishment mad but enthralls crowds in the late stages of the most important championships.
Whether the tennis establishment likes it or not, no one in the sport fills a stadium like Kyrgios these days. Even his doubles matches have become raucous, packed affairs. And as the Australian Open gets underway, Kyrgios, 27, is among the favorites to challenge nine-time champion Novak Djokovic for his home Slam, which may be the ultimate double-edged sword. That level of pressure and expectation has been kryptonite for Kyrgios before, his self-destructive psyche exploding at a crucial moment, producing his unique brand of irresistible tennis theater.
“It’s going to be a hard couple weeks, regardless of whether I win or lose, emotionally, mentally,” Kyrgios said in a pre-Christmas interview from his parents’ home. “I’m one of the players that has a scope lens on him all the time. Big target on my back.”
With all his recent success and notoriety, so much suddenly appears to be riding on Kyrgios. The game’s leaders see him as the rare player who can reach a new and younger audience. Fans raise their beers and bump chests as Kyrgios wins points with his signature trick shots through the legs and behind the back. They wear basketball jerseys when they watch him and when they play, just as he does, and they turn his matches, even the doubles contests, into the something like a rowdy night at a UFC bout.
“He brings something different,” said Andrea Gaudenzi, a former pro who is now the chair of the ATP Tour, the men’s professional circuit.
Ken Solomon, chair and CEO of the Tennis Channel, the sport’s leading media partner, called Kyrgios “ground zero” in efforts to attract fans who have never touched a racket and perhaps never will. On Friday, Netflix released “Break Point,” its documentary series on pro tennis that the sport hopes will do for it what “Drive to Survive” did for Formula One. The premiere episode focused almost exclusively on Kyrgios, who took a signature victory lap on Twitter.
Tennis Australia announced earlier last week that Kyrgios would play Djokovic in a charity exhibition Friday evening. Tickets sold out in 58 minutes.
Three hours before the match, he hobnobbed with the top clients of a luxury hotel chain during a promotional table tennis game. Before the event started, he sat alone in a quiet hallway, feeling the pressure of what lay ahead. Moments later, holding a racket in a packed rooftop bar, the bright eyes and big smile of the star entertainer emerged.
Leaning on Kyrgios as a pitchman for the game carries plenty of risk. What makes him so irresistible, that at any time he might produce another can’t-miss moment on the court, has at times made him a walking grenade. And he’s the one with a finger on the pin.
There is also the allegation of domestic violence.
In early February, Kyrgios is due in court in Canberra to face a charge of common assault stemming from an altercation with an ex-girlfriend, Chiara Passari, in December 2021. Kyrgios has declined to discuss the matter since it became public during his run to the Wimbledon final in July.
Common assault is the least serious assault charge in Australia, but it implies that the victim experienced immediate, unlawful violence, or the threat of it, although not bodily injury. Kyrgios’ lawyers have said that they will mount a defense focused on mental illness, citing his history of depression and substance abuse, struggles that Kyrgios has said will always be with him but that he now has under control. If the court accepts this defense and dismisses the case, it could then decide to impose a treatment plan. The maximum penalty for common assault is two years’ imprisonment.
The incident occurred during the first weeks of Kyrgios’ relationship with his now-constant companion, Costeen Hatzi, whom he met online. He had also just recommitted himself fully to tennis after years of ambivalence and mental turmoil. The sport had brought riches and fame but also loneliness, with its endless travel and solitary battles on the court, which tortured his psyche.
The withering criticism and racist attacks he endured when he lost matches that he was expected to win, or broke rackets and berated tennis officials, triggered memories of those years before a growth spurt at 17 turned him into a strapping, 6-foot-4 elite athlete. As an overweight boy with dark skin and modest means in an overwhelmingly white country where everyone seemed to have more, he was mocked and bullied, despite his talent for tennis, or maybe because of it.
Goran Ivanisevic, the Wimbledon champion who coaches Djokovic, has called Kyrgios a “tennis genius.” Kyrgios’ father, Giorgos, first noticed that skill when Kyrgios was a toddler hitting a ball hanging on a string from a metal pole. He never missed. Soon Kyrgios was learning the sport on dilapidated courts near his parents’ home in Canberra. His father, a house painter from Greece, would hit a bucket of balls with him after work.
“Still wears the same overalls he walked off the boat in,” Kyrgios said of his father, who still paints houses. “He must have been exhausted.”
His mother, Norlaila, who is from Malaysia and worked as a software engineer for health care organizations, would drive for hours to get him and his brother to tournaments. They stayed at backpacker hostels and tried to stretch $20 to cover dinner for him and his siblings at cheap Indian restaurants in the countryside.
His parents knew next to nothing about tennis. Tennis Australia and the tennis authority for his provincial region worked to fill in the gaps, and Kyrgios notched his breakthrough win at 19, when he upset of Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2014.
It nearly ruined him. After that win and all the expectations it produced, Kyrgios thought he had to solve every problem on his own. When he couldn’t, he lashed out, at tennis officials, the media and the people around him.
Then, last fall, after a year in which he flirted with quitting but also showed flickers of his magical game, Kyrgios began to realize he didn’t have to do it all alone. He could talk about his fears and insecurities and the fragility of his mind to the people closest to him, and they could help.
“Knowing that I am not alone anymore and I can kind of open up and talk to people, now that’s a big one for me,” he said. “It’s OK to, you know, feel like having to cry some days.”
He also decided he was tired of letting himself and others down. Before last year’s Australian Open, he embarked on the kind of solid six-week training block he had not done in years. He played with top opponents for 90 minutes each day and hit the weight room. He spent two hours several times a week playing full-court basketball, his true love, with top Australian players to hone his conditioning.
Asked for a scouting report on his hoops game, he put it like this:
“Loves shooting mid-rangers,” “Can shoot a three-ball pretty good,” “Play like a wing,” “In the corner,” “Come off picks,” “Pretty versatile,” “Can guard a big,” “Pretty physical,” “Like Tobias Harris in his prime.”
He also ate better, and he focused on getting more rest instead of more drinks.
By the end of January, with Thanasi Kokkinakis, his countryman and childhood friend, he had won the doubles title for his first Grand Slam championship. Then he mostly stuck to the healthier living through Wimbledon, where he once had to be dragged from a pub at 4 a.m. on the morning of a match. Not this time, although his sublime tennis did come with multiple confrontations with chair umpires and a tense verbal sparring match with Stefanos Tsitsipas during which Tsitsipas tried to hit Kyrgios with a ball.
He fell to Djokovic in the final in four sets, but he remained disciplined through the U.S. Open. There, he obliterated the top seed and defending champion, Daniil Medvedev, in the fourth round before suffering an upset loss to Karen Khachanov of Russia in the quarterfinals. Exhausted from the season and from playing mostly at night so broadcasters could maximize the television audience, he caught the first flight home and played just one more singles tournament.
Kyrgios will play Roman Safiullin, an unheralded Russian, in the first round Tuesday.
What happens now?
Tennis, like few other sports, is an MRI of the soul. Kyrgios knows he will never pursue the game with the clinical efficiency and emotional discipline that Nadal and Djokovic have showcased for so long. He is going to throw and break rackets. It’s a manifestation of how much he cares, he said, and for him to thrive, tennis has to be about who he is, someone who plays with emotion, instinct and improvisation, like a jazz solo rather than a symphony.
If he can do that, maybe he can find peace on the court, even when the pressure brings the stress of a near-explosion that keeps his mother, too worried about what will happen, from being able to watch.
“Not many people can say that they have become a Slam threat, they are going to have the support of the nation, well, the support of some of the nation behind him,” he said. “Just got to try to enjoy it.”
For Kyrgios, that has always been the toughest task of all. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Influencers Help Propane Group Fight Climate Action: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: An industry group is spending millions of dollars to push back against efforts to move heating away from oil and gas.
For D.I.Y. enthusiasts, Matt Blashaw is a familiar face, judging bathroom remodels or planning surprise home makeovers on popular cable television shows.
Mr. Blashaw also has an unusually strong opinion about how Americans should heat their homes: by burning propane, or liquid petroleum gas.
"When I think of winter, I think of being inside. I think of cooking with the family, of being by a roaring fire -- and with propane, that is all possible," he said on a segment of the CBS affiliate WCIA, calling in from his bright kitchen. "That's why we call it an energy source for everyone."
Less well known is the fact that Mr. Blashaw is paid by a fossil fuel industry group that has been running a furtive campaign against government efforts to move heating away from oil and gas toward electricity made from wind, solar and other cleaner sources.
The Propane Education and Research Council, or PERC, which is funded by propane providers across the country, has spent millions of dollars on "provocative anti-electrification messaging" for TV, print and social media, using influencers like Mr. Blashaw, according to the group's internal documents viewed by The New York Times.
As a federally-sanctioned trade association, PERC is allowed to collect fees on propane sales, which helps fund its marketing campaigns. But according to the law that created this system, that money is supposed to be used for things like research and safety.
In 2023, the organization plans to spend $ 13 million on its anti-electrification campaign, including $ 600,000 on "influencers" like Mr. Blashaw, according to the documents, which were obtained from PERC's website as well as a public records request by the Energy and Policy Institute, a pro-renewables group.

The overwhelming majority of scientists around the globe agree that the burning of coal, gas and oil produces greenhouse gases that are dangerously heating the planet. Scientists commissioned by the United Nations have warned that nations must deeply and quickly cut those emissions to avoid a catastrophic escalation of deadly flooding, heat waves, drought and species extinction.
The propane industry sees things differently. It needs to "combat the growing narrative that fossil fuel combustion is the main cause of climate change, and that propane is a dirty fossil fuel," Stuart Weidie, chairman and chief executive of North Carolina propane company Blossman Gas, told the propane council at a February 2021 meeting.
"The movement to electrify everything is rapidly gaining momentum, and poses a substantial threat to the sustainability of our industry," he said, according to meeting minutes.
Erin Hatcher, who heads communications at PERC, said its campaign "asserts propane's role in a clean energy future" and "promotes the advantages of a wide path to decarbonization." Influencers like Mr. Blashaw, she said "use and specify propane in their construction projects and are very familiar with propane's advantages." Ms. Hatcher would not say how much her group has paid Mr. Blashaw.
Mr. Weidie said that his fundamental belief in the importance of a low-carbon future had been "lost in out-of-context conversation." He said he believed electrification was set to "play a big role but is not the only answer," and that propane was "a great energy for generations to come."
Mr. Blashaw referred questions to PERC.
Most American homes are heated by natural gas or oil. But in states where the energy grid is increasingly powered by wind, solar and other renewables, electric heat pumps are fast becoming a lower-carbon alternative to gas and oil. They heat as well as cool.
Researchers at Princeton University found that for the United States to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050, nearly one-quarter of American homes would need to switch to heat pumps. That's double the number today.
Congress has approved billions of dollars to help Americans electrify buildings, including tax credits for heat pumps, as part of the major climate law passed last summer.
But such a shift would reduce demand for propane, which is used in 50 million American homes, in furnaces, stoves, fireplaces and a range of appliances, according to the National Propane Gas Association. Propane, like natural gas, doesn't emit as much planet-warming greenhouse gases as coal, gasoline or diesel. But it's still derived from fossil fuels.
"If you're burning gas to heat your house anywhere in a northern climate, it's a huge amount of emissions, probably the largest part of your emissions," said Forrest Meggers, an associate professor at Princeton.
The propane industry's anti-electrification campaign has been particularly well funded because of PERC's status as a federally-sanctioned trade association.
A 1996 law authorized the creation of PERC and allowed it to collect a half-cent fee on every gallon of propane it sells, an example of what is known as a federal "checkoff program" designed to support specific industry sectors, typically agricultural commodities. Those fees are supposed to be used for safety and consumer education, training, or research and development projects.
But ambiguous language in the original bill, together with limited oversight by the Department of Energy, has meant the group has diverted millions of dollars from the fee toward marketing, including its anti-electrification campaigns. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has repeatedly raised concerns that PERC has been misusing the funds it raises from the fee, which comes to more than $ 40 million a year, and criticized lax government oversight.
PERC has also funded groups working on campaigns in response to federal and state climate policies, possibly violating a provision in the 1996 law that bans the organization from lobbying, the G.A.O. has warned.
In 2022, for example, PERC committed nearly $ 900,000 to a New York propane industry group to address the "massive challenge from well-funded efforts to electrify the entire state" -- namely, to fight policies stemming from New York's 2019 climate law which, among other goals, aims to ensure that buildings and vehicles stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2040.
New York had passed "the most radical climate change legislation in the country" and propane was "marked for extinction, along with natural gas, heating oil and gasoline," Rich Goldberg, whose public relations firm led the effort, warned last year in a blog post. The propane industry needed to run an "aggressive, fuel-neutral campaign aimed at slowing down the CLCPA electrification freight train," he said, referring to New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.
On social media and an opposition website, the local New York Propane Gas Association panned heat pumps as cripplingly expensive and unreliable, especially in cold climates, urging residents to oppose the state's climate plans. The group also lobbied against a state carbon tax, which failed to advance.
The group's claim about heat pumps is misleading. Advances in technology mean the pumps are effective in colder regions, said Dr. Meggers of Princeton. Federal rebates of up to $ 8,000 for low- and moderate-income households, as well as various state-level incentives, have made heat pumps more affordable. And efficient heat pumps can save households hundreds of dollars a year, compared to oil and gas systems, according to the Department of Energy.
Still, by the New York propane group's own accounting, its social media ads reached 2 million people, and its videos were shown more than 2.8 million times. "PERC is running the largest national anti-electrification campaign I've encountered anywhere in the United States," said Charlie Spatz, a researcher at the Energy and Policy Institute. "Propane customers, whether they're buying fuel for their home heating or for their grill, they're unwittingly funding PERC's anti-climate agenda."
In an interview, Mr. Goldberg stood by his characterization of the New York climate law. "People would be required to convert their energy use in their house, how they drive, how power is produced," he said. "That's pretty extreme."
Ms. Hatcher of PERC, meanwhile, said the council was unaware of any current concerns about its spending. She said the group makes sure the activities it funds are authorized under the 1996 law and added that most of its budget goes to research and development, training, and safety education.
PERC budgets for 2021-2023 seen by The Times show that marketing and communications is the largest spending category.
Senator Martin Heinrich, Democrat of New Mexico and a strong advocate for climate action, said he would be "requesting that the Department of Energy exercise its statutory oversight to ensure that PERC complies with the law and spends its funds appropriately."
The Energy Department "takes seriously any allegations that an entity associated with the department may be conducting activities outside the scope of its congressional authorization," spokeswoman Charisma Troiano said in a statement. She said her department would "work with our congressional partners to examine these allegations."
She added that the department was requesting additional information after PERC submitted a budget in December 2022 which only provided "basic information on the Council's activities."
The New York Propane Gas Association did not provide comment.
The propane industry's messaging has gone beyond heating.
"Space Gal" Emily Calandrelli is a Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained science communicator who has hosted shows on Netflix.
She is now a paid influencer for the propane industry, according to PERC documents.
Last August, Ms. Calandrelli appeared on local Houston network CW39 to malign electric bus technology as expensive, unreliable -- and, where the electric grid is still powered heavily by coal and natural gas, not very clean.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"The good news is that there are now better alternatives for cleaner school buses today, like propane school buses," she said, which could reduce tailpipe emissions for a far lower cost.
Experts question that claim. For tailpipe emissions that could both harm kids' lungs and warm the planet, "electric buses are going to change the game," said Hailin Li, a professor at West Virginia University. And with the federal government providing $ 5 billion toward electric school buses, there is little reason to go with propane, he said.
Federal rules require broadcasters to announce when content has been sponsored or paid for in any way. CW39 did state that Ms. Calandrelli is working with "Energy For Everyone," but did not name the propane industry.
Ms. Hatcher of PERC said TV networks were fully aware of their guests' sponsors. Ms. Calandrelli referred questions to PERC. CW39 did not respond to requests for comment.

Blashaw also has an unusually strong opinion about how Americans should heat their homes: by burning propane, or liquid petroleum gas.
“When I think of winter, I think of being inside. I think of cooking with the family, of being by a roaring fire — and with propane, that is all possible,” he said on a segment of the CBS affiliate WCIA, calling in from his bright kitchen. “That’s why we call it an energy source for everyone.”
Less well known is the fact that Blashaw is paid by a fossil fuel industry group that has been running a furtive campaign against government efforts to move heating away from oil and gas toward electricity made from wind, solar and other cleaner sources.
The Propane Education and Research Council, or PERC, which is funded by propane providers across the country, has spent millions of dollars on “provocative anti-electrification messaging” for TV, print and social media, using influencers like Blashaw, according to the group’s internal documents viewed by The New York Times.
As a federally-sanctioned trade association, PERC is allowed to collect fees on propane sales, which helps fund its marketing campaigns. But according to the law that created this system, that money is supposed to be used for things like research and safety.
In 2023, the organization plans to spend $13 million on its anti-electrification campaign, including $600,000 on “influencers” like Blashaw, according to the documents, which were obtained from PERC’s website as well as a public records request by the Energy and Policy Institute, a pro-renewables group.
The overwhelming majority of scientists around the globe agree that the burning of coal, gas and oil produces greenhouse gases that are dangerously heating the planet. Scientists commissioned by the United Nations have warned that nations must deeply and quickly cut those emissions to avoid a catastrophic escalation of deadly flooding, heat waves, drought and species extinction.
The propane industry sees things differently. It needs to “combat the growing narrative that fossil fuel combustion is the main cause of climate change, and that propane is a dirty fossil fuel,” Stuart Weidie, chair and chief executive of North Carolina propane company Blossman Gas, told the propane council at a February 2021 meeting.
“The movement to electrify everything is rapidly gaining momentum, and poses a substantial threat to the sustainability of our industry,” he said, according to meeting minutes.
Erin Hatcher, who heads communications at PERC, said its campaign “asserts propane’s role in a clean energy future” and “promotes the advantages of a wide path to decarbonization.” Influencers like Blashaw, she said, “use and specify propane in their construction projects and are very familiar with propane’s advantages.” Hatcher would not say how much her group has paid Blashaw.
Weidie said his fundamental belief in the importance of a low-carbon future had been “lost in out-of-context conversation.” He said he believed electrification was set to “play a big role but is not the only answer,” and that propane was “a great energy for generations to come.”
Blashaw referred questions to PERC.
Most American homes are heated by natural gas or oil. But in states where the energy grid is increasingly powered by wind, solar and other renewables, electric heat pumps are fast becoming a lower-carbon alternative to gas and oil. They heat as well as cool.
Researchers at Princeton University found that for the United States to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050, nearly one-quarter of American homes would need to switch to heat pumps. That’s double the number today.
Congress has approved billions of dollars to help Americans electrify buildings, including tax credits for heat pumps, as part of the major climate law passed last summer.
But such a shift would reduce demand for propane, which is used in 50 million American homes, in furnaces, stoves, fireplaces and a range of appliances, according to the National Propane Gas Association. Propane, like natural gas, doesn’t emit as much planet-warming greenhouse gases as coal, gasoline or diesel. But it’s still derived from fossil fuels.
“If you’re burning gas to heat your house anywhere in a northern climate, it’s a huge amount of emissions, probably the largest part of your emissions,” said Forrest Meggers, an associate professor at Princeton.
The propane industry’s anti-electrification campaign has been particularly well funded because of PERC’s status as a federally-sanctioned trade association.
A 1996 law authorized the creation of PERC and allowed it to collect a half-cent fee on every gallon of propane it sells, an example of what is known as a federal “checkoff program” designed to support specific industry sectors, typically agricultural commodities. Those fees are supposed to be used for safety and consumer education, training, or research and development projects.
But ambiguous language in the original bill, together with limited oversight by the Department of Energy, has meant the group has diverted millions of dollars from the fee toward marketing, including its anti-electrification campaigns. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has repeatedly raised concerns that PERC has been misusing the funds it raises from the fee, which comes to more than $40 million a year, and criticized lax government oversight.
PERC has also funded groups working on campaigns in response to federal and state climate policies, possibly violating a provision in the 1996 law that bans the organization from lobbying, the GAO has warned.
In 2022, for example, PERC committed nearly $900,000 to a New York propane industry group to address the “massive challenge from well-funded efforts to electrify the entire state” — namely, to fight policies stemming from New York’s 2019 climate law which, among other goals, aims to ensure that buildings and vehicles stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2040.
New York had passed “the most radical climate change legislation in the country” and propane was “marked for extinction, along with natural gas, heating oil and gasoline,” Rich Goldberg, whose public relations firm led the effort, warned last year in a blog post. The propane industry needed to run an “aggressive, fuel-neutral campaign aimed at slowing down the CLCPA electrification freight train,” he said, referring to New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.
On social media and an opposition website, the local New York Propane Gas Association panned heat pumps as cripplingly expensive and unreliable, especially in cold climates, urging residents to oppose the state’s climate plans. The group also lobbied against a state carbon tax, which failed to advance.
The group’s claim about heat pumps is misleading. Advances in technology mean the pumps are effective in colder regions, Meggers said. Federal rebates of up to $8,000 for low- and moderate-income households, as well as various state-level incentives, have made heat pumps more affordable. And efficient heat pumps can save households hundreds of dollars a year, compared to oil and gas systems, according to the Department of Energy.
Still, by the New York propane group’s own accounting, its social media ads reached 2 million people, and its videos were shown more than 2.8 million times. “PERC is running the largest national anti-electrification campaign I’ve encountered anywhere in the United States," said Charlie Spatz, a researcher at the Energy and Policy Institute. “Propane customers, whether they’re buying fuel for their home heating or for their grill, they’re unwittingly funding PERC’s anti-climate agenda.”
In an interview, Goldberg stood by his characterization of the New York climate law. “People would be required to convert their energy use in their house, how they drive, how power is produced,” he said. “That’s pretty extreme.”
Hatcher of PERC, meanwhile, said the council was unaware of any current concerns about its spending. She said the group makes sure the activities it funds are authorized under the 1996 law and added that most of its budget goes to research and development, training, and safety education.
PERC budgets for 2021-2023 seen by the Times show that marketing and communications is the largest spending category.
Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., a strong advocate for climate action, said he would be “requesting that the Department of Energy exercise its statutory oversight to ensure that PERC complies with the law and spends its funds appropriately.”
The Energy Department “takes seriously any allegations that an entity associated with the department may be conducting activities outside the scope of its congressional authorization,” spokesperson Charisma Troiano said in a statement. She said DOE would “work with our congressional partners to examine these allegations.”
She added that the department was requesting additional information after PERC submitted a budget in December 2022 which only provided “basic information on the council’s activities.”
The New York Propane Gas Association did not provide comment.
The propane industry’s messaging has gone beyond heating.
“Space Gal” Emily Calandrelli is a Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained science communicator who has hosted shows on Netflix.
She is now a paid influencer for the propane industry, according to PERC documents.
In August, Calandrelli appeared on local Houston network CW39 to malign electric bus technology as expensive, unreliable — and, where the electric grid is still powered heavily by coal and natural gas, not very clean.
“The good news is that there are now better alternatives for cleaner school buses today, like propane school buses,” she said, which could reduce tailpipe emissions for a far lower cost.
Experts question that claim. For tailpipe emissions that could both harm kids’ lungs and warm the planet, “electric buses are going to change the game,” said Hailin Li, a professor at West Virginia University. And with the federal government providing $5 billion toward electric school buses, there is little reason to go with propane, he said.
Federal rules require broadcasters to announce when content has been sponsored or paid for in any way. CW39 did state that Calandrelli is working with “Energy For Everyone,” but did not name the propane industry.
Hatcher of PERC said TV networks were fully aware of their guests’ sponsors. Calandrelli referred questions to PERC. CW39 did not respond to requests for comment. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

NBC News Taps a Senior Editor at The Times to Serve as Its Next President: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The appointment of Ms. Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor at The Times, is a part of a broad overhaul of the news division at NBCUniversal.
NBCUniversal has appointed Rebecca Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor at The New York Times, as the president of editorial for NBC News, as part of a far-reaching reorganization of the division.
Ms. Blumenstein, 56, has overseen The Times's recruiting efforts and operations as part of the newsroom's top management team and advised the paper's publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. At NBC, she will inherit many of the responsibilities of Noah Oppenheim, who has been president of NBC News since 2017. He has struck a production deal with NBCUniversal, working on film and TV projects for the company.
With the appointment, Cesar Conde, who oversees NBCUniversal's news division, is turning over major parts of his marquee news brand to a highly decorated print and digital journalist, but one with little experience in television.
Ms. Blumenstein, a Michigan native, is a former foreign correspondent who served as deputy editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal before joining the senior leadership of The Times in 2017. She will take charge of the network's sprawling reporting operation as it seeks to expand its digital audience amid a long-term decline in broadcast TV viewership.
In a reorganization led by Mr. Conde, who as chairman of NBCUniversal News Group also runs CNBC and MSNBC, Ms. Blumenstein will oversee household-brand shows like "Meet the Press" and "Dateline."
Some significant parts of NBC News overseen by Mr. Oppenheim will now report directly to Mr. Conde, including the network's flagship program, "NBC Nightly News," and the lucrative "Today" franchise of morning programming. The cable channels MSNBC and CNBC do not fall under Mr. Oppenheim's portfolio and will continue to be led by their own presidents.
During her tenure at The Times, Ms. Blumenstein helped develop new formats to cover big breaking news events in real time, part of The Times's aggressive expansion of its digital journalism. She led the evacuation and resettlement of the company's Afghan employees and their families in the wake of the Taliban's takeover of Kabul in 2021.
In a statement on Wednesday, Ms. Blumenstein said that she was grateful to Mr. Sulzberger and Joe Kahn, the executive editor of The Times, for their "commitment to independent journalism."
"The news landscape is rapidly evolving," Ms. Blumenstein said. "I look forward to building on the deep journalistic foundation at NBC News to help the organization achieve its ambitions."
At The Journal, Ms. Blumenstein led a team of China correspondents to a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. In China, she got to know Mr. Kahn, then a fellow foreign correspondent; Mr. Kahn appointed Ms. Blumenstein to his senior leadership team when he became The Times's executive editor last year.
Her departure comes a few weeks after The Times announced that Clifford Levy, another deputy managing editor, would move to the company's business side later this year as deputy publisher of The Athletic and Wirecutter.
In a note to Times employees, Mr. Kahn said that "NBC News is very lucky to have" Ms. Blumenstein. "As I learned when we worked for rival news organizations covering China, she is a superb, competitive journalist who is also a delightful colleague," Mr. Kahn wrote.
At NBC, Mr. Oppenheim leaves his role after a six-year tenure that coincided with huge changes in the business model of TV news and the frenetic pace of the Trump presidency and a worldwide pandemic.
An NBC veteran who began as a producer for the Chris Matthews show "Hardball," Mr. Oppenheim took on major roles at CNBC and "Today" before ascending to lead NBC News. He led an expansion of the network's digital operations, including the debut of a fast-growing ad-supported streaming service, NBC News Now. NBC News Now generates more than 30 million hours of viewership monthly, the network said.
His tenure was also marked by controversy. Ronan Farrow, a former journalist and anchor at MSNBC, accused leadership at NBCUniversal, including Mr. Oppenheim, of trying to conceal a blockbuster investigation into allegations of sexual assault against the film producer Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Oppenheim said that Mr. Farrow's story, as reported for the network, did not meet its standards for publication. Tensions related to the episode spilled into public, including an extraordinary on-air moment when Rachel Maddow said she had deep concerns about the organization's handling of the story. NBC News renewed Mr. Oppenheim's contract after the episode.
In a memo on Wednesday, Mr. Oppenheim said he was proud that NBC News remains "the gold standard in journalism," adding: "Sharing this front-row seat to history with the smartest, most committed and most compassionate colleagues has been a tremendous privilege."
Mr. Conde, in appointing a veteran newspaper journalist to a key role, appeared to send a firm signal that he believes his organization's future will be increasingly digital and less dependent on traditional broadcast programming. In a memo on Wednesday, he said that NBC's news operations would evolve "to stay ahead of the many changes in the technology that delivers the news."
Ms. Blumenstein, he wrote, would "drive our journalism and original content across our broadcast and digital platforms as they continue to converge." Since Mr. Conde started as chairman in 2020, he has remade the news division's executive ranks, appointing Rashida Jones as president of MSNBC and KC Sullivan as president of CNBC.
The "Today" franchise will continue to be led by Libby Leist, a long-serving steward of the morning franchise. "NBC Nightly News" will continue to be led by Janelle Rodriguez, another NBC veteran who will also continue to oversee NBC News Now.
Along with his ongoing role at NBCUniversal, Mr. Oppenheim is developing a limited series at Netflix starring Robert DeNiro. Tentatively titled "Zero Day," the series is described as a political thriller in which Mr. DeNiro portrays an ex-president who returns to run the country in the wake of a major catastrophe. Mr. Oppenheim's collaborators on the series include Eric Newman, the showrunner of the drug trafficking drama "Narcos," and Michael S. Schmidt, a reporter at The Times.
Mr. Oppenheim is not the first media executive to daydream about jumping to the entertainment side, but he is rare among his peers in having found some success in that endeavor: He wrote the screenplay for the 2016 biopic "Jackie" starring Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy, the former first lady.

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Prince Harry and the Value of Silence," by Patti Davis (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Jan. 7):
I have not watched the Netflix documentary, nor do I plan to read Prince Harry's book about his family. Ms. Davis's essay expressed my sentiments exactly.
We do not need to know people's private family matters, and I think no good can come of this. I feel for Harry in that he is young and in time may come to regret his actions.
This royal life seems to be a very unhappy one, and I do hope that things come out well for him in the end, but I do not see that airing your dirty laundry is going to help matters.
Bette Cotter
Glendale, Calif.
To the Editor:
The British have a word for it: "whingeing." The closest we Americans can come to it is "crying in your beer." Whatever you want to call it, Harry has been wallowing in it.
While he may deserve a modicum of sympathy for having been born into a life that was largely preordained, he could have made a gracious exit. His uncle Prince Edward had the gumption to separate himself from monarchical constraints and forge a career in his own right, apart from the pomp and ceremony of the royal court.
Prince Harry could have done the same thing. He instead chose to exploit the prerogatives of his birth while at the same time reviling the system that offered him the platform to air his puerile grievances.
He should grow up.
Miles B. Anderson
Sag Harbor, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Re "Why Is America So Taken With These Two?," by Pamela Paul (column, Jan. 10):
Even though Harry's TV interviews and book might be self-serving, it doesn't matter to most Americans. He comes off as a smart, decent human being, just as vulnerable as the rest of us, a likable bloke.
In 1776, when Americans declared their independence from the throne, the British press reacted with contempt. Over 200 years later, when Prince Harry declared his independence from the monarchy, the British press responded with scorn. Some things never change.
Chase Webb
Portland, Ore.
To the Editor:
I don't know why entitled narcissists whose claim to fame is being famous seem so appealing, but I suspect it's for the same reason the Kardashians are millionaires and Donald Trump improbably became president.
If only we gave the same support to those with character, ability and talent.
Jay Markowitz
Pound Ridge, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Pamela Paul asks why Americans have a "particular crush" on the Sussexes. There's not a lot of evidence that they do.
Our media, however, seem to believe that the U.S. public is fascinated by and even admirers of royalty. Perhaps our columnists and TV commentators are overly influenced by the British tabloids' intense coverage of royalty.
The tabloids also whipped up support in the U.K. for Brexit; that's not turning out very well. And there's always an audience for circuses and spectacles of all sorts.
Richard Hoffman
Washington
To the Editor:
Could I please see by a show of hands all those who have had more than enough of Harry and Meghan?

Changing Our Gun Culture
To the Editor:
Re "Child's Access to Gun Shocks Virginia School" (front page, Jan. 10), about a 6-year-old who shot his teacher using a gun from home:
In a rational, caring and responsible society, the young are rightly viewed and treated as not having matured intellectually, emotionally and psychologically until their late teens to mid-20s. Grade-school-age children are not fully responsible for the quality of their judgments and decisions.
It is the responsibility of the society to educate, instill civilized values and put proper controls on behavior, as well as protect its youths from others and themselves. This role is assigned both to parents or other primary caretakers and to societal institutions such as schools, law enforcement and government.
In our culture, gun use and attitudes toward gun ownership have surpassed reasonableness to the level of immorality. We can't be in denial about this fact and we must address this problem, as a 6-year-old packing and violently using a handgun makes clear.
Paul Rosenberg
Palm Beach, Fla.

Fix the Korean War Memorial
To the Editor:
Re "Korean War Memorial Is Riddled With Errors" (front page, Jan. 9):
It is no surprise that the list of names etched onto the granite of the Korean War Veterans Memorial includes incorrect information and that there are names missing. Even if the results of the Barker brothers' work -- the Korean War Project -- had been properly utilized, some errors and omissions would have been inevitable.
Isn't there a role for technology here? Instead of permanently engraved names that are difficult and costly to revise, why not add a multimedia exhibit where individual names could be searched and displayed, perhaps with photos and a line or two about veterans' wartime experiences? It could easily be updated and corrected, probably for a very reasonable price.
If such technology is ever included, I hope the Barker brothers' extraordinary work and dedication to this project are highlighted. Thank you for calling attention to their efforts.
Linda Acheson Pool
Fox Chapel, Pa.
Please Don't Annoy the Bison
To the Editor:
Re "Establishing a New Home for Bison to Roam" (Science Times, Jan. 10):
I foresee a possible problem. If this project succeeds in getting large herds of bison roaming the West, people are going to want to see them. They are going to want to take selfies with bison.
I lived in Wyoming for about 10 years in the late 1970s and early '80s. Every year we would see stories in the paper about some tourist who got stomped or gored because they wanted their picture taken with a bison.
Bison are 1,500 pounds of smelly, nearsighted bad temper. They don't like people walking up to them to take selfies; they really don't like people trying to take a selfie with their babies. They are very capable of reducing said clueless tourist to dust.

Storing Digital Data
To the Editor:
Re "Your Memories. Their Cloud" (Sunday Business, Jan. 1), about the risks of storing important data on technology companies' servers:
This was a very timely article articulating the need to drastically reduce our personal digital data storage. But an issue not mentioned by the writer is the lack of security offered by digital storage methods in addition to the cloud.
Cloud storage is fine, but its vendors provide no guarantee that your data is safe, nor do they compensate for lost data. The problem with all other storage technologies -- be they CDs, hard drives, magnetic tapes or thumb drives -- is that they all have finite and often remarkably short lifetimes, putting critical data at risk. Further, magnetic and semiconductor storage are especially susceptible to the rare solar flare that may strike the earth at any time.
Considerable work is currently underway to develop new archival storage technologies that will successfully store data for centuries without change.

For do-it-yourself enthusiasts, Matt Blashaw is a familiar face, judging bathroom remodels or planning surprise home makeovers on popular cable television shows.
Blashaw also has an unusually strong opinion about how Americans should heat their homes: by burning propane, or liquid petroleum gas.
“When I think of winter, I think of being inside. I think of cooking with the family, of being by a roaring fire — and with propane, that is all possible,” he said on a segment of the CBS affiliate WCIA, calling in from his bright kitchen. “That’s why we call it an energy source for everyone.”
Less well known is the fact that Blashaw is paid by a fossil fuel industry group that has been running a furtive campaign against government efforts to move heating away from oil and gas toward electricity made from wind, solar and other cleaner sources.
The Propane Education and Research Council, or PERC, which is funded by propane providers across the country, has spent millions of dollars on “provocative anti-electrification messaging” for TV, print and social media, using influencers like Blashaw, according to the group’s internal documents viewed by The New York Times.
As a federally-sanctioned trade association, PERC is allowed to collect fees on propane sales, which helps fund its marketing campaigns. But according to the law that created this system, that money is supposed to be used for things like research and safety.
In 2023, the organization plans to spend $13 million on its anti-electrification campaign, including $600,000 on “influencers” like Blashaw, according to the documents, which were obtained from PERC’s website as well as a public records request by the Energy and Policy Institute, a pro-renewables group.

Weidie said his fundamental belief in the importance of a low-carbon future had been “lost in out-of-context conversation.” He said he believed electrification was set to “play a big role but is not the only answer,” and that propane was “a great energy for generations to come.”
Blashaw referred questions to PERC.
Most American homes are heated by natural gas or oil. But in states where the energy grid is increasingly powered by wind, solar and other renewables, electric heat pumps are fast becoming a lower-carbon alternative to gas and oil. They heat as well as cool.
Researchers at Princeton University found that for the United States to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050, nearly one-quarter of American homes would need to switch to heat pumps. That’s double the number today.
Congress has approved billions of dollars to help Americans electrify buildings, including tax credits for heat pumps, as part of the major climate law passed last summer.
But such a shift would reduce demand for propane, which is used in 50 million American homes, in furnaces, stoves, fireplaces and a range of appliances, according to the National Propane Gas Association. Propane, like natural gas, doesn’t emit as much planet-warming greenhouse gases as coal, gasoline or diesel. But it’s still derived from fossil fuels.
“If you’re burning gas to heat your house anywhere in a northern climate, it’s a huge amount of emissions, probably the largest part of your emissions,” said Forrest Meggers, an associate professor at Princeton.
The propane industry’s anti-electrification campaign has been particularly well funded because of PERC’s status as a federally-sanctioned trade association.
A 1996 law authorized the creation of PERC and allowed it to collect a half-cent fee on every gallon of propane it sells, an example of what is known as a federal “checkoff program” designed to support specific industry sectors, typically agricultural commodities. Those fees are supposed to be used for safety and consumer education, training, or research and development projects.
But ambiguous language in the original bill, together with limited oversight by the Department of Energy, has meant the group has diverted millions of dollars from the fee toward marketing, including its anti-electrification campaigns. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, has repeatedly raised concerns that PERC has been misusing the funds it raises from the fee, which comes to more than $40 million a year, and criticized lax government oversight.
PERC has also funded groups working on campaigns in response to federal and state climate policies, possibly violating a provision in the 1996 law that bans the organization from lobbying, the GAO has warned.
In 2022, for example, PERC committed nearly $900,000 to a New York propane industry group to address the “massive challenge from well-funded efforts to electrify the entire state” — namely, to fight policies stemming from New York’s 2019 climate law which, among other goals, aims to ensure that buildings and vehicles stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2040.
New York had passed “the most radical climate change legislation in the country” and propane was “marked for extinction, along with natural gas, heating oil and gasoline,” Rich Goldberg, whose public relations firm led the effort, warned last year in a blog post. The propane industry needed to run an “aggressive, fuel-neutral campaign aimed at slowing down the CLCPA electrification freight train,” he said, referring to New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.
On social media and an opposition website, the local New York Propane Gas Association panned heat pumps as cripplingly expensive and unreliable, especially in cold climates, urging residents to oppose the state’s climate plans. The group also lobbied against a state carbon tax, which failed to advance.
The group’s claim about heat pumps is misleading. Advances in technology mean the pumps are effective in colder regions, Meggers said. Federal rebates of up to $8,000 for low- and moderate-income households, as well as various state-level incentives, have made heat pumps more affordable. And efficient heat pumps can save households hundreds of dollars a year, compared to oil and gas systems, according to the Department of Energy.
Still, by the New York propane group’s own accounting, its social media ads reached 2 million people, and its videos were shown more than 2.8 million times. “PERC is running the largest national anti-electrification campaign I’ve encountered anywhere in the United States," said Charlie Spatz, a researcher at the Energy and Policy Institute. “Propane customers, whether they’re buying fuel for their home heating or for their grill, they’re unwittingly funding PERC’s anti-climate agenda.”
In an interview, Goldberg stood by his characterization of the New York climate law. “People would be required to convert their energy use in their house, how they drive, how power is produced,” he said. “That’s pretty extreme.”
Hatcher of PERC, meanwhile, said the council was unaware of any current concerns about its spending. She said the group makes sure the activities it funds are authorized under the 1996 law and added that most of its budget goes to research and development, training, and safety education.
PERC budgets for 2021-2023 seen by the Times show that marketing and communications is the largest spending category.
The Energy Department “takes seriously any allegations that an entity associated with the department may be conducting activities outside the scope of its congressional authorization,” spokesperson Charisma Troiano said in a statement. She said DOE would “work with our congressional partners to examine these allegations.”
She added that the department was requesting additional information after PERC submitted a budget in December 2022 which only provided “basic information on the council’s activities.”
The New York Propane Gas Association did not provide comment.
The propane industry’s messaging has gone beyond heating.
“Space Gal” Emily Calandrelli is a Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained science communicator who has hosted shows on Netflix.
She is now a paid influencer for the propane industry, according to PERC documents.
In August, Calandrelli appeared on local Houston network CW39 to malign electric bus technology as expensive, unreliable — and, where the electric grid is still powered heavily by coal and natural gas, not very clean.
“The good news is that there are now better alternatives for cleaner school buses today, like propane school buses,” she said, which could reduce tailpipe emissions for a far lower cost.
Experts question that claim. For tailpipe emissions that could both harm kids’ lungs and warm the planet, “electric buses are going to change the game,” said Hailin Li, a professor at West Virginia University. And with the federal government providing $5 billion toward electric school buses, there is little reason to go with propane, he said.
Federal rules require broadcasters to announce when content has been sponsored or paid for in any way. CW39 did state that Calandrelli is working with “Energy For Everyone,” but did not name the propane industry.
Hatcher of PERC said TV networks were fully aware of their guests’ sponsors. Calandrelli referred questions to PERC. CW39 did not respond to requests for comment. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
NBCUniversal has appointed Rebecca Blumenstein, a deputy managing editor at The New York Times, as the president of editorial for NBC News, as part of a far-reaching reorganization of the division.
Blumenstein, 56, has overseen the Times’ recruiting efforts and operations as part of the newsroom’s top management team and advised the paper’s publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. At NBC, she will inherit many of the responsibilities of Noah Oppenheim, who has been president of NBC News since 2017. He has struck a production deal with NBCUniversal, working on film and TV projects for the company.
With the appointment, Cesar Conde, who oversees NBCUniversal’s news division, is turning over major parts of his marquee news brand to a highly decorated print and digital journalist, but one with little experience in television.
Blumenstein, a Michigan native, is a former foreign correspondent who served as deputy editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal before joining the senior leadership of the Times in 2017. She will take charge of the network’s sprawling reporting operation as it seeks to expand its digital audience amid a long-term decline in broadcast TV viewership.
In a reorganization led by Conde, who as chair of NBCUniversal News Group also runs CNBC and MSNBC, Blumenstein will oversee household-brand shows like “Meet the Press” and “Dateline.”
Some significant parts of NBC News overseen by Oppenheim will now report directly to Conde, including the network’s flagship program, “NBC Nightly News,” and the lucrative “Today” franchise of morning programming. Cable channels MSNBC and CNBC do not fall under Oppenheim’s portfolio and will continue to be led by their own presidents.
During her tenure at the Times, Blumenstein helped develop new formats to cover big breaking news events in real time, part of the Times’ aggressive expansion of its digital journalism. She led the evacuation and resettlement of the company’s Afghan employees and their families in the wake of the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021.
In a statement Wednesday, Blumenstein said that she was grateful to Sulzberger and Joe Kahn, the executive editor of the Times, for their “commitment to independent journalism.”
“The news landscape is rapidly evolving,” Blumenstein said. “I look forward to building on the deep journalistic foundation at NBC News to help the organization achieve its ambitions.”
At the Journal, Blumenstein led a team of China correspondents to a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. In China, she got to know Kahn, then a fellow foreign correspondent; Kahn appointed Blumenstein to his senior leadership team when he became the Times’ executive editor last year.
Her departure comes a few weeks after the Times announced that Clifford Levy, another deputy managing editor, would move to the company’s business side later this year as deputy publisher of The Athletic and Wirecutter.
In a note to Times employees, Kahn said that “NBC News is very lucky to have” Blumenstein. “As I learned when we worked for rival news organizations covering China, she is a superb, competitive journalist who is also a delightful colleague,” Kahn wrote.
At NBC, Oppenheim leaves his role after a six-year tenure that coincided with huge changes in the business model of TV news and the frenetic pace of the Trump presidency and a pandemic.
An NBC veteran who began as a producer for the Chris Matthews show “Hardball,” Oppenheim took on major roles at CNBC and “Today” before ascending to lead NBC News. He led an expansion of the network’s digital operations, including the debut of a fast-growing ad-supported streaming service, NBC News Now. NBC News Now generates more than 30 million hours of viewership monthly, the network said.
His tenure was also marked by controversy. Ronan Farrow, a former journalist and anchor at MSNBC, accused leadership at NBCUniversal, including Oppenheim, of trying to conceal a blockbuster investigation into allegations of sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Oppenheim said that Farrow’s story, as reported for the network, did not meet its standards for publication. Tensions related to the episode spilled into the public, including an extraordinary on-air moment when Rachel Maddow said she had deep concerns about the organization’s handling of the story. NBC News renewed Oppenheim’s contract after the episode.
In a memo Wednesday, Oppenheim said he was proud that NBC News remains “the gold standard in journalism,” adding, “Sharing this front-row seat to history with the smartest, most committed and most compassionate colleagues has been a tremendous privilege.”
Conde, in appointing a veteran newspaper journalist to a key role, appeared to send a firm signal that he believes his organization’s future will be increasingly digital and less dependent on traditional broadcast programming. In a memo Wednesday, he said that NBC’s news operations would evolve “to stay ahead of the many changes in the technology that delivers the news.”
Blumenstein, he wrote, would “drive our journalism and original content across our broadcast and digital platforms as they continue to converge.” Since Conde started as chair in 2020, he has remade the news division’s executive ranks, appointing Rashida Jones as president of MSNBC and KC Sullivan as president of CNBC.
The “Today” franchise will continue to be led by Libby Leist, a long-serving steward of the morning franchise. “NBC Nightly News” will continue to be led by Janelle Rodriguez, another NBC veteran who will also continue to oversee NBC News Now.
Along with his ongoing role at NBCUniversal, Oppenheim is developing a limited series at Netflix starring Robert De Niro. Tentatively titled “Zero Day,” the series is described as a political thriller in which De Niro portrays an ex-president who returns to run the country in the wake of a major catastrophe. Oppenheim’s collaborators on the series include Eric Newman, the showrunner of the drug-trafficking drama “Narcos,” and Michael S. Schmidt, a reporter at the Times.
Oppenheim is not the first media executive to daydream about jumping to the entertainment side, but he is rare among his peers in having found some success in that endeavor: He wrote the screenplay for the 2016 biopic “Jackie” starring Natalie Portman as Jacqueline Kennedy, the former first lady.

Murphy Aims To Let More Sell Liquor In New Jersey: [National Desk]

Full text: "It is OK to admit it. It's cool to be from New Jersey again," Gov. Philip D. Murphy said on Tuesday in his State of the State address.
TRENTON, N.J. -- Gov. Philip D. Murphy presented an upbeat vision of New Jersey on Tuesday during his State of the State address: a suddenly cool state where A-list actors come to shoot movies and, with luck, residents will have more places to grab a drink.
Mr. Murphy, who was re-elected in 2021 by a narrow margin, is the chairman of both the National Governors Association and the Democratic Governors Association. His wife, Tammy Murphy, has set up a super PAC that could be used to bolster any future political ambitions that Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, might harbor. He has said that he strongly supports President Biden, an ally from the same party who has indicated that he plans to run for re-election.
Still, Tuesday's annual address had the air of an audition.
Mr. Murphy mentioned his friendship with Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah, a Republican and vice chairman of the National Governors Association, and derided "Washington-style dysfunction and chaos."
"Let us never forget that in the grand ranking of things, we are partisans fourth, elected officials third, New Jerseyans second and Americans first and foremost," he said during his first in-person State of the State since 2020, prompting many in the room to stand and clap. Here are some takeaways.
Murphy wants to phase out tightly controlled liquor licenses.
In a nearly hourlong speech, the governor discussed only a few initiatives.
He proposed phasing out liquor license rules over the next several years, a suggestion nearly as contentious as asking residents to pump their own gas. He also said the state would begin offering free and anonymous access to Naloxone, an opioid overdose-reversal drug, and give Shore communities funds to rebuild ocean boardwalks.
Liquor licenses in the state are currently a fixed commodity: In each municipality, the state permits one license for every 3,000 residents.
As a result, the ability to sell alcohol at a restaurant or bar is a coveted -- and expensive -- right, which can be sold for a large profit.
"The old rules have purposely created market scarcity and driven up costs to the point where a liquor license can draw seven figures," Mr. Murphy said.
He estimated that expanding the number of licenses, which would most likely require legislative approval, would create 10,000 jobs and generate $ 1 billion in new tax revenue.
To offset financial losses, current license holders would be eligible for a "targeted tax credit," the governor said, "to support them as the supply of licenses grows."
Much of Mr. Murphy's first term was spent railing against a corporate tax incentive program created by his Republican predecessor. But then he pushed through $ 14 billion in corporate tax breaks in less than a week, a deal that helped him to broker peace with critics in his own party ahead of his re-election campaign.
On Tuesday, he proposed altering the tax incentive program to give companies financial credit for remote workers.
"We have to recognize that in the new, post-pandemic business environment, not every new job created for a New Jerseyan is going to be housed in a physical office in New Jersey," he said. "For many New Jerseyans, working remotely is here to stay."
The governor focused on touting progress in the state.
Mr. Murphy, 65, broke from his past left-leaning rhetoric and instead focused on his efforts to make New Jersey more affordable -- and safer.
He ticked off efforts to reduce car thefts and strengthen gun laws, progress that on Monday faced a setback when a federal judge ruled that key elements of a recent gun-related law were unconstitutional.
The law, which Mr. Murphy signed three weeks ago in response to a Supreme Court ruling in June, set up a broad list of places where gun owners are not permitted to carry weapons -- a half dozen of which were invalidated by the judge, Renée Marie Bumb.
The attorney general has said the state planned to appeal the ruling.
Much of the address offered a look back at policies from Mr. Murphy's first term and the hopeful path on which he believes he has placed New Jersey.
He touted the state's expanded film and television industry, growth evident in Netflix's decision to build a production hub at a former military installation on the Jersey Shore. The site is expected to be the company's second-biggest production complex, after its studios in New Mexico.
He also stressed his hope of making New Jersey an East Coast leader in wind energy and the growth in the state's new cannabis industry.
"It is OK to admit it," he said. "It's cool to be from New Jersey again. It's cool because we are once again leading in all the right things."

Trying To Escape A Royal Catch-22: [Review]

Full text: At once emotional and embittered, the royal memoir is mired in a paradox: drawing endless attention in an effort to renounce fame.
SPARE, by Prince Harry
Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex and Man About Montecito, isn't one for book learning, he reminds readers of his new memoir, "Spare." And yet its pages are dappled with literary references, from John Steinbeck ("He kept it tight," the prince writes admiringly of "Of Mice and Men"); to William Faulkner, whose line from "Requiem for a Nun" about the past never being dead, nor even past, he discovers on BrainyQuote.com; to Wordsworth and other poets. Shakespeare's "Hamlet," though, hit a little too close to home. "Lonely prince, obsessed with dead parent, watches remaining parent fall in love with dead parent's usurper...?" Harry writes. "No, thank you."
He prefers to sink into TV comedies like "Family Guy," where he admires Stewie, the unnervingly mature baby, and "Friends," where he identifies with the tortured Chandler Bing. Reading "Spare," though, one kind of wants to snatch the remote control from his hands and press into them a copy of Joseph Heller's "Catch-22." Not because of Harry's military endeavors (unlike Yossarian, he seems to have felt sane only in active combat) but because of the seemingly inescapable paradox of his situation.
In the prince's full-throated renunciation of fame and royalty with all its punishing invasions of privacy, he has only become more famous, if not more regal, trading his proximity to the throne for the No. 1 spot on cushioned chairs opposite Oprah and Anderson Cooper. With "Harry & Meghan," the gauzy Netflix series preceding this book, he and the Duchess now might well be overexposed. (Maybe this is part of the grand plan, to drive away inquiring minds by boring them to bits?)
My interest in the English royal family tends to dwindle after the era of previous renouncers like Edward and Wallis and the dynamically dysfunctional Princess Margaret, who "could kill a houseplant with one scowl," Harry writes. They weren't close; Margaret once gave him a cheap pen wrapped with a rubber fish for Christmas. I devoured early episodes of "The Crown" but Season 5, with its focus on Charles and Diana's marital troubles, left me delicately yawning.
Still, I expected to enjoy "Spare," given that it was written with the help of the talented author J.R. Moehringer, whose own memoir, "The Tender Bar," I adored before it was even a glimmer in Ben Affleck's eye, and who helped the tennis star Andre Agassi's autobiography, "Open," transcend the locker room. And I did. In parts.
"Spare" -- its title as minimalist as Agassi's; its cover a similar full-frontal stare -- is a thing of many parts, of shreds and patches, of bitter gibes (particularly at Harry's older brother, William, the "heir" to his "spare," whom he calls "Willy") and sustained existential crisis. Its basic three-act structure of childhood, Army service and wedded bliss is as subdivided as a California lot into shorter episodes and paragraphs, many only one sentence long.
Harry's distinctly English voice (he doesn't like kilts, for example, because of "that worrisome knife in your sock and that breeze up your arse") at times does weird battle with the staccato patois of a tough-talking private eye doing voice-over in a film noir. Describing his "Gan-Gan" at Balmoral: "She wore blue, I recall, all blue ... Blue was her favorite color." Then, like a gun moll, the Queen Mother orders a martini.
If there's a murder Harry is trying to solve, it's of course that of his own mother, Princess Diana, whose death in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in 1997, under chase by paparazzi, is the defining tragedy of his life, and thus of this book. To her younger son, only 12 at the time, the click of cameras wielded by paps, as he derisively calls them, came to sound "like a gun cocking or a blade being notched open." (From the looks of "Harry & Meghan," which has plenty of sanctioned shots of the couple's courtship and toddlers, he is fighting back by hand with his own iPhone.) Diana defended herself against the constant onslaught of photographers by lobbing water balloons and, more sinisterly, by hiding in the trunks of getaway cars, a trick Harry eventually picked up. "It felt like being in a coffin," he writes. "I didn't care."
Mired in a "red mist" of grief and anger, the prince self-medicates at first with candy and then, as the hated tabloids report with varying degrees of accuracy, alcohol, weed, cocaine, mushrooms and ayahuasca. (More mildly he tries magnesium supplements, and I'm not sure anyone needs to know that this loosened his bowels at a friend's wedding.)
Along with Harry's deployment to Afghanistan -- where, he observes, "you can't kill people if you think of them as people" -- he escapes repeatedly to Africa, whose lions seem less threatening than the journalistic predators at home. In one of the book's cringier moments, he writes that Willy, who calls him Harold though his given name is Henry, stamps his foot over choosing the continent as a cause. "Africa was his thing," Harry explains, mimicking his brother's petulant tone. "I let you have veterans, why can't you let me have African elephants and rhinos?"
Cattily he notes Willy's "alarming baldness, more advanced than my own," while dinging the Princess of Wales for being slow to share her lip gloss. Candidly he shows the then-Prince Charles doing headstands in his boxer shorts and his family's charade of an annual performance review: the Court Circular.
Like its author, "Spare" is all over the map -- emotionally as well as physically. He does not, in other words, keep it tight. Harry is frank and funny when his penis gets frostbitten after a trip to the North Pole -- "my South Pole was on the fritz" -- leaving him a "eunuch" just before William marries Kate Middleton. In an odd feat of projection, he gives the groom an ermine thong at the reception, then applies to his own nether regions the Elizabeth Arden cream that his mother used as lip gloss -- "'weird' doesn't really do the feeling justice" -- and worries that "my todger would be all over the front pages" before finding a discreet dermatologist.
Therapy, in which he claims William refuses to participate, and a whiff of First by Van Cleef & Arpels, help Harry learn to cry, unlocking a stream of repressed recollections of Diana, and that's when even the most hardened reader might herself weep. Charles's own scent, Dior's Eau Sauvage, and his marriage to Camilla, leave him relatively cold.
And yet when his father advises of the unrelenting and often racist press coverage of Harry's union to Meghan -- "Don't read it, darling boy" -- it's difficult not to agree. The prince claims to have a spotty memory -- "a defense mechanism, most likely" -- but doesn't appear to have forgotten a single line ever printed about him and his wife, and the last section of his tell-all degenerates into a tiresome back-and-forth about who's leaking what and why. Maybe a little more Faulkner and less Fleet Street would be helpful here?
Still bitter over the late author Hilary Mantel, unnamed here, comparing the royal family to pandas -- "uniquely barbarous" and dehumanizing, he writes, while admitting "we did live in a zoo" -- Harry then turns right around and calls three courtiers the Bee, the Fly and the Wasp. He seems both driven mad by "the buzz," as the royals' inexhaustible chronicler Tina Brown would call it, and constitutionally unable to stop drumming it up.

TRENTON, N.J. — Gov. Philip D. Murphy presented an upbeat vision of New Jersey on Tuesday during his State of the State address: a suddenly cool state where A-list actors come to shoot movies and, with luck, residents will have more places to grab a drink.
Murphy, who was reelected in 2021 by a narrow margin, is the chair of both the National Governors Association and the Democratic Governors Association. His wife, Tammy Murphy, has set up a super PAC that could be used to bolster any future political ambitions that Murphy, a Democrat, might harbor. He has said that he strongly supports President Joe Biden, an ally from the same party who has indicated that he plans to run for reelection.
Still, Tuesday’s annual address had the air of an audition.
Murphy mentioned his friendship with Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah, a Republican and vice chair of the National Governors Association, and derided “Washington-style dysfunction and chaos.”
“Let us never forget that in the grand ranking of things, we are partisans fourth, elected officials third, New Jerseyans second and Americans first and foremost,” he said during his first in-person State of the State since 2020, prompting many in the room to stand and clap. Here are some takeaways.
Murphy wants to phase out tightly controlled liquor licenses.
In a nearly hourlong speech, the governor discussed only a few initiatives.
He proposed phasing out liquor license rules over the next several years, a suggestion nearly as contentious as asking residents to pump their own gas. He also said the state would begin offering free and anonymous access to naloxone, an opioid overdose-reversal drug, and give Shore communities funds to rebuild ocean boardwalks.
Liquor licenses in the state are a fixed commodity: In each municipality, the state permits one license for every 3,000 residents.
As a result, the ability to sell alcohol at a restaurant or bar is a coveted — and expensive — right, which can be sold for a large profit.
“The old rules have purposely created market scarcity and driven up costs to the point where a liquor license can draw seven figures,” Murphy said.
He estimated that expanding the number of licenses, which would most likely require legislative approval, would create 10,000 jobs and generate $1 billion in new tax revenue.
To offset financial losses, current license holders would be eligible for a “targeted tax credit,” the governor said, “to support them as the supply of licenses grows.”
Much of Murphy’s first term was spent railing against a corporate tax incentive program created by his Republican predecessor. But then he pushed through $14 billion in corporate tax breaks in less than a week, a deal that helped him to broker peace with critics in his own party ahead of his reelection campaign.
On Tuesday, he proposed altering the tax incentive program to give companies financial credit for remote workers.
“We have to recognize that in the new, post-pandemic business environment, not every new job created for a New Jerseyan is going to be housed in a physical office in New Jersey,” he said. “For many New Jerseyans, working remotely is here to stay.”
The governor focused on touting progress in the state.
Murphy, 65, broke from his past left-leaning rhetoric and instead focused on his efforts to make New Jersey more affordable — and safer.
He ticked off efforts to reduce car thefts and strengthen gun laws, progress that on Monday faced a setback when a federal judge ruled that key elements of a recent gun-related law were unconstitutional.
The law, which Murphy signed three weeks ago in response to a Supreme Court ruling in June, set up a broad list of places where gun owners are not permitted to carry weapons — a half dozen of which were invalidated by the judge, Renée Marie Bumb.
The attorney general has said the state planned to appeal the ruling.
Much of the address offered a look back at policies from Murphy’s first term and the hopeful path on which he believes he has placed New Jersey.
He touted the state’s expanded film and television industry, growth evident in Netflix’s decision to build a production hub at a former military installation on the Jersey Shore. The site is expected to be the company’s second-biggest production complex, after its studios in New Mexico.
He also stressed his hope of making New Jersey an East Coast leader in wind energy and the growth in the state’s new cannabis industry.
“It is OK to admit it,” he said. “It’s cool to be from New Jersey again. It’s cool because we are once again leading in all the right things.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

After a River of Revelations, Prince Harry’s Memoir Lands in the U.K.

LONDON — The release of Prince Harry’s memoir, “Spare,” was hotly anticipated in Britain, with revelations from leaked passages headlining newspapers across the country in recent days.
But as bookstores placed “Spare” in window displays and flung open their doors Tuesday, reaction appeared muted in London under a rainy gray sky. Early morning lines teemed with journalists, but regular book buyers were slower to file through the doors.
That seemed at odds with the interest that some booksellers said the memoir had drummed up and with the anticipation it had garnered online. Waterstones, Britain’s largest bookstore chain, said that it had seen some of the biggest preorders in a decade and that “unprecedented” numbers of people had ordered the memoir for in-store pickup Tuesday. The memoir also raced to the top of the list of bestsellers on Amazon’s websites in Britain and the United States.
“We expect ‘Spare’ to be one of this year’s bestsellers,” John Cotterill, the nonfiction category manager for Waterstones, said in a statement Tuesday, saying that the book “added welcome interest to a usually quieter month.”
A spokesperson for another retailer, WHSmith, declined to comment on sales but said that the company had extended hours at a small number of stores so that they would be open at midnight for the memoir’s release.
Of those who did venture into bookstores, some were curious and others were dismissive of the latest episode in a mounting royal drama that has played out in tell-all interviews, in a Netflix documentary series and on social media.
Some said they saw recent revelations by Harry as nothing more than a distraction — the machinations of Britain’s aristocracy at stark odds with the deepening economic squeeze being felt across the country.
“It’s been hugely overblown. I don’t think people care,” said Nikki Kastner, an owner of Herne Hill Books, a small independent seller in south London. “It’s not exactly the ‘Harry Potter’ launch, is it?”
Others, however, appeared to be more intrigued.
Monika Nicolaou, a self-described fan of Britain’s royal family, dropped by the Waterstones bookstore in London’s Piccadilly Circus to pick up a copy of “Spare” Tuesday and planned to start reading it on her way to work.
“Dirty laundry should be left behind the scenes,” she said, explaining that she disapproved of Harry’s decision to share secrets about the royal family. “I don’t think it was brave.” Still, she said, she wanted to read his perspective.
In the book, Harry writes about the death of his mother, Princess Diana; about his account of the negotiations over his role in the family that led Harry and his wife, Meghan, to eventually leave England; about his tense relationship with his brother, Prince William; about his own battles with anxiety and about his time in Afghanistan; and other insights.
“​​It’s making people question whether they really like him or not,” said James Broadley, who was looking at the bookstore’s display with his wife. The book is retailing for 28 pounds (about $35), but many retailers like Waterstones and Amazon are selling it for half price — a customary offer for a “highly anticipated and prominent publication” to compete with heavy online discounting, according to a spokesperson for Waterstones.
Although Broadley said he did not see himself as a huge royalist, he said he was considering buying the book and nonetheless found the situation intriguing.
“It feels like they’ve gone the tabloid aspect of dishing dirt,” he said, adding that although the book was a “cash grab,” he understood the motivations behind it.
“This is part of him going alone,” Broadley said. “He’s got to make it somehow.”
Harry has said that he will give a portion of proceeds from the book to British charities, according to a description on the memoir’s website.
The biggest revelation for Elisabeth Stang, 56, a tourist from Norway who picked up a copy of the book at Waterstones, was the extent of the rift between Harry and William, now heir to the throne. “They are a hurt family,” she said, adding that the two had lost their mother so young and with the whole world watching them.
“I just think they are more normal than maybe we all think they are,” she said.
Joanna Davey, 38, who was passing through Waterstones for a meeting but did not buy the book, said, “I just feel really sad for him. I think you can tell he’s really experienced a lot of trauma in his life.
“It would be better if he sat down with a therapist instead of spilling his guts on paper,” she added. In the book, Harry does write about going to therapy, saying his wife persuaded him to continue it.
Aside from rainy skies, some blamed the wall-to-wall news media coverage of the memoir’s leaked contents in previous days for any less-than-enthusiastic in-person reaction Tuesday.
“It’s been on the radio all week. People are sick of it,” said Salman Gohar, a London cabdriver. “It took the magic out of the launch.
“I liked him before, but he’s just going after them one by one now,” Gohar added in reference to Harry.
The book’s revelations have reignited older gossip about the family among royal watchers — Harry writing, for example, about how he and his brother begged his father not to marry Camilla, now the queen consort.
For those unwilling to brave the weather Tuesday, there was social media. Reactions flickered among the comical, the supportive and the morally outraged. The hashtags #SparebyPrinceHarry and #Camilla trended Tuesday on Twitter, with many lamenting that Harry was aggravating mounting rifts in the royal family, while others expressed sympathy for his account of what he and his wife had endured.
Even bookstores could not resist getting in on the action, with one independent retailer in Britain opting for a characteristically more satirical window display.
“Anyway, we do have some spare copies of Spare if you want one,” it concluded. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Day 6 | Interact With Others: [Science Desk]

Full text: If you think you'll be happier staying home, you're wrong.
This is Day 6 of Well's 7-day Happiness Challenge. To start at the beginning, click here .
Predicting how a future event will make us feel is known in psychology as affective forecasting -- and most human beings are pretty lousy at it. "People are terrible at knowing what is good for them," said Dr. Bob Waldinger, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, "and we seem particularly bad at forecasting the benefits of relationships."
It can be tempting to just stay home rather than socialize, said Dr. Waldinger, who is an author of the new book "The Good Life." "We'll think, 'I know I'm going to be happy if I stay home and watch Netflix but not if I go to that party."'
But interacting with other people, he said, often "improves our mood and makes us happier than we expect it will. Making the choice to go out and be with people involves risk, usually a small one -- but offers the possibility for encounters that are enlivening, interesting or just plain fun."
Happiness Challenge Day 6: Put a social plan on the calendar
Your exercise for today is to make a social plan -- a walk with the old friend you never seem to see, lunch with the former co-worker who always made you laugh -- and put it on the calendar. If you've ever told someone you like that you should get coffee "sometime," today's the day to make it official. Do not cancel or postpone.
"Many of us might be out of shape when it comes to socializing," said Philip Gable, an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Delaware. Motivate yourself to go out by setting small goals instead of larger ones, he suggested. Instead of committing to be at a party for three hours, he said, give yourself a half-hour, or vow that you'll chat with three people. And of course it doesn't have to be a party. A face-to-face human interaction of any sort, especially one that might build toward more social dates in the future, is what we're aiming for today.
There's a group out there for everybody
A good way to build ties is by joining a group that meets regularly -- say, a pickle-ball team at the local gym. Researchers call that regular proximity with other humans propinquity and have shown that the more propinquity we have, the greater the chances are that we'll form friendships.
To create more propinquity for yourself, get creative. Dig in a neighborhood community garden. Volunteer with a dog-rescue group. Join a local walking club.
A 2016 study found that people who had what the researchers called "multiple group identifications" -- such as church communities, hobby groups, support groups or sports teams -- had greater levels of happiness. And the more groups they were in, the better. "Overall," the researchers wrote, "our findings suggest that thinking more about one's group life (and perhaps putting a plan into action in order to enhance it) could have significant benefits for one's overall sense of well-being."
Even introverts need social activities
A 2020 study conducted during the pandemic found that the resulting social isolation was not, as was commonly believed, "an introvert's paradise." Even for people who considered themselves introverts, the study authors write, "close human affiliation serves as a protective buffer against social disconnectedness and low mood."
A self-described introvert, Jenn Granneman, the founder of the online community Introvert, Dear and the author of the upcoming book "Sensitive: The Hidden Power of the Highly Sensitive Person in a Loud, Fast, Too-Much World," has said that introverts aren't antisocial but instead selectively social. Introverts can cultivate a sense of belonging by "looking for passions rather than friends," said Susan Cain, the author of "Quiet: The Power of Introverts In A World That Can't Stop Talking," a repudiation of the extrovert ideal. Pursue something that interests you, she said, and "the like-minded friends will come."
Introverts can summon the resolve to initiate plans by telling themselves they're "giving the gift of going first," Ms. Granneman added. "Send the text, ask the question or plan a date. You might be surprised at how much the other person appreciates you reaching out."
One way Ms. Granneman does this is to buy two tickets, a few months in advance, to any shows or events that catch her eye. When the event rolls around, she said, "having the extra ticket puts some pressure on me, in a good way, to reach out to my network because I want someone to go with me and I don't want the ticket to go to waste." Most people are excited to be offered a ticket, she said, and almost always accept.
Here's a bonus exercise for today: If you receive an invitation this week, say yes when you normally might say no.
Did you put something social on the calendar this week? Let us know in the comments.
From the Friendship Files: Uzma, Liz, David and Scott
Each day of Well's 7-Day Happiness Challenge, we'll be sharing stories of meaningful friendships collected from readers across the country. We'd love to hear yours. Submit your own tale of friendship .
Uzma's three best friends -- Liz, David and Scott -- have been at the center of her life for two decades, offering each other "unconditional love." Her father died when she was in college, and she is estranged from her mother. "This friendship has been my chosen family," she said. "Whatever matters to one of us matters to all of us."
Uzma, 37, met Liz first, in a North Carolina high school. Despite their different backgrounds -- Liz is the daughter of Christian ministers; Uzma is Muslim, a first-generation American whose parents are from Burma and India -- the pair became inseparable. They had sleepovers every weekend and joined each other on family vacations and holidays. "Liz picked up Hindi just being with my family so much," Uzma said.
The two met Scott and David early in their first year of college. Over the years, they have bonded over board games and trivia nights. "We love a good puzzle," she said.
They lived together at times during college and after. "We've just always wanted to be together," Uzma said. "We've all brought things that are different, like, Scott's Jewish and I'm Muslim. Liz and I happen to be straight. Scott and David happen to be gay."
In the 20 years since college, they have scattered across the country -- and, at times, the world -- so the foursome has relied on traditions to stay connected. They rent a big house "somewhere in the middle" nearly every New Year's and Fourth of July. Once, it was the beach in Delaware; another get-together was in the Poconos. ("When one of us meets a serious partner, we know it's real when they are invited to the reunion weekends," Uzma said.) They also have a running group text and used Google Chat and Skype to hang out online well before the pandemic.
"We're each other's good-news friends. We're each other's bad-news friends," Uzma said. "Separate from each other's parents and significant others, we are each others' first phone calls." -- Catherine Pearson

Why Is America So Taken With These Two?: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Whether out of Anglophilia, nostalgia, masochism, traditionalism or just a particular strain of fealty to the rich and famous, America's quixotic devotion to the British monarchy remains strong.
What, then, explains America's particular crush on the semiroyal Sussexes? Harry and Meghan haven't been especially kind to the monarchy since fleeing Frogmore, their renovated royal "cottage," in 2020. Nor did they ever fully deliver on the prospect of an American infiltration of the crown.
But their most recent multiplatform, multimillion-dollar media blitz -- which began with Meghan's Spotify podcast, expanded into a six-part Netflix documentary tribute to their love for each other and for themselves, and culminates this week with a "60 Minutes" interview with Harry that aired Sunday night and then the publication of his memoir, "Spare" -- offers several possible reasons the duke and duchess have been spared the ire they stirred up overseas.
It's because they chose America. Apparently, it's better to be a celebrity in the United States than fifth in line for the throne in Britain. Though Harry and Meghan are now without royal stipend, they've got a sizable inheritance in a country where the rich grow richer and where members of royalty, without the baggage of being a tax burden, are treated with less skepticism. Having initially decamped to Vancouver Island in a bid for privacy, they soon fled to Los Angeles in a bid for -- what's the opposite of privacy? As Harry says in the documentary, he'd "outgrown" his environment and "this was the most obvious place to come."
The fact that the Sussexes ditched a country they characterize as anti-immigrant, overrun with racists and burdened by the legacy of colonialism makes Americans feel better about their own country, which also (whoops) might be described as anti-immigrant, overrun with racists and burdened by the legacy of colonialism. But Harry and Meghan see America as a haven.
"They made it such an issue when I went to the U.K.," Meghan says of her mixed-race heritage in the documentary. "Before that, most people didn't treat me like a Black woman." Perhaps Americans appreciate the notion that nationalism and xenophobia are somehow over there and not here. It's nice to be let off the hook for a change.
It's because they're fighting for change. Call them martyrs, call them revolutionaries, call them anti-establishment or simply change makers. Now thoroughly enlightened re: the old order's ills, Harry and Meghan are taking a stand against colonialism, racism and oppression of all stripes, jetting around the world, occasionally in a friend's private plane, in their campaign against injustice. As the website for their organization Archewell ("Leading the way with compassion") proclaims: "Each of us can change our communities. All of us can change the world."
Many people in Britain, across the Commonwealth and in America did, in fact, see the interracial couple's union as a sign of positive change -- but perhaps no one more so than the couple themselves. In a run-up interview to promote her podcast last year, Meghan recalled a South African man who compared the joy at her royal wedding to the celebrations when Nelson Mandela was freed from prison. But, according to the Sussexes' narrative, they became too popular, threatening the monarchy. As Harry put it, they were "stealing the limelight" or "doing the job better than someone who was born to do this."
The series goes a step further in its anti-institutional fervor, tying the couple's personal travails to a reckoning with British colonialism, the mistreatment of Princess Diana and the Black Lives Matter movement. One of the documentary's sympathetic talking heads refers to the pair as "symbols of social justice" and says the hate directed toward them was "a way to signal to the rest of us to stand down." According to this version of events, the palace has pushed back against the couple because, as Harry explains, "if you speak truth to power, that's how they respond."
It's because they speak our language. This isn't about the accent but about the mode. Harry and Meghan value sharing over the stiff upper lip. Rather than staying mum, they insist on speaking up and speaking out -- and speaking their own truth, as opposed to the more rigorous feat of speaking the truth. When they do speak, it's in the manicured, massaged and meditative parlance of self-care and cause-driven commerce. Words like "conscious," "consent" and "purpose" roll off their tongues in soothing uptalk. They've created a "safe harbor" for themselves. This is a "new path we were trying to forge." Their work is about "creative activations" and "building community."
Everything is done with intention. "We've been really conscious of protecting our kids as best as we can and also understanding the role that they play in this really historical family," Meghan explains in the documentary. Because the palace wouldn't protect them, they must protect themselves. Once they were victims; now they are survivors. As a media-scarred Harry put it to Anderson Cooper on "60 Minutes" Sunday, "I will sit here and speak truth to you with the words that come out of my mouth, rather than using someone else, an unnamed source, to feed in lies or a narrative to a tabloid media that literally radicalizes its readers to then potentially cause harm to my family, my wife, my kids."
It's because they're American-style celebrities. Harry and Meghan have outdone Princess Diana's collaborations with the press by taking full control. They are our first reality-TV royals. And in America, while it's wrong for someone else to invade your privacy, it's perfectly fine -- even applauded -- to exploit your own.
The Sussexes are accessible. They're fun! Meghan is just a working mom. Harry is a romping millennial dad. These celebrities -- they're just like us! -- can tell us all about themselves via their own artisanal media empire.
You can find them on Instagram, where they initially found each other and where they chose to announce their independence (as they would say, "stepping back rather than stepping down"). They take selfies, they film themselves incessantly, and at least one of them has firm views about portrait versus landscape iPhone footage. The documentary spends a solid episode offering a blow-by-blow -- or, rather, a text-by-text -- narrative of their entire courtship. They give us so much private information, saturating us with the minutiae of each glowing embrace, that they essentially deprive us of wanting or needing to get anything more anywhere else.
Like many a TikToker or Substacker, Harry and Meghan relish taking charge of the narrative. They made their documentary, they say, because, as they put it, they've never been "asked" for their story and weren't "allowed" to tell it. That's if you don't count fawning coverage from Oprah, People or The Cut. (Only very recently -- was it mid-Episode 5? Or 6? -- did some in the American media palpably flag in their adulation.)
But even the friendliest venues stopped short of the couple's preferred spin on "The Little Mermaid." In Harry's twitterpated eyes: Meghan "sacrificed everything that she ever knew, the freedom that she had, to join me in my world. And then, pretty soon after that, I ended up sacrificing everything I know to join her in her world." Prince Harry undeniably sacrificed his family and his birthright. Most people, royal fans or not, would have liked to see this all play out differently.
Despite the dents and holes in their well-honed and highly lucrative story, the Sussexes have delivered an especially American take on what the American Meghan calls a "modern fairy tale." America loves a melodrama, an against-all-odds story, an us versus them. America loves an almost happily ever after and any gossip that keeps on giving. As is now abundantly clear, Harry and Meghan are giving their all to give America all of that.

A Royal Tell-All Is Everywhere. Has the Public Heard Enough?: [News Analysis]

Full text: Even in the United States, which has a high tolerance for redemptive stories about overcoming trauma and family dysfunction, the tide seems to be turning.
In their prolonged campaign to tell their story -- and to present themselves as victims of the British royal family, the tabloid press and critics and haters everywhere -- Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, have in the last two years revealed their secrets to Oprah Winfrey, revealed them again to various sympathetic television interviewers, produced and starred in a six-part Netflix series and, in the case of Harry, appeared on the actor Dax Shepard's podcast, "Armchair Expert."
Now comes the prince's multimillion-dollar ghostwritten memoir, "Spare." Set for release Tuesday, it has been leaking out over the last few days, one eye-popping detail after the next. (The book mistakenly appeared in stores early in Spain, and was snapped up and translated by alert members of the British news media, injecting an element of chaos into the publisher's rollout.)
Harry and Meghan still have many sympathizers, particularly those who see the couple's grievances through the lens of the racism Meghan encountered in Britain and who say that she -- and Harry, once he married her -- never stood a chance in such a stultified, reactionary institution as the monarchy.
But something has changed, judging from the response so far. Even in the United States, which has a soft spot for royals in exile and a generally higher tolerance than Britain does for redemptive stories about overcoming trauma and family dysfunction, there is a sense that there are only so many revelations the public can stomach.
"Look, everyone has a family," the television host Don Lemon declared on "CNN This Morning" last week. "I have arguments in my family. Am I going to put that out there for the whole world to see? I don't understand why on earth he would want to put that out there. I know he's selling a book, but to me it's just ..." ("Gauche," he added later.)
Was it gauche, for instance, for Harry to accuse Prince William of pushing him to the floor while the two argued about Meghan, ripping Harry's necklace and shattering a dog's bowl whose shards then gouged his back? Or to describe how the brothers squabbled in front of their father after Prince Philip's funeral? ("Please, boys, don't make my final years a misery," Charles is quoted as saying.) How about Harry's account of how, high on mushrooms, he believed a garbage can was talking to him, or the passage about how Meghan offended Kate, the Princess of Wales, by boldly asking if she could borrow her lip gloss?
It's one thing to be criticized; it's another to be openly ridiculed.
It can't be a great sign, for instance, that the Jimmy Kimmel show last week staged a re-enactment of the supposed argument in the kitchen that it called "Two Princes." Set to a voice-over of an actor reading the passage in a plummy English accent, the skit featured two actors who were, bizarrely, each dressed as the musician Prince.
On the other side of the Atlantic, four media personalities on the couch of the British show "This Morning" could barely keep it together last week as they discussed another revelation in the book, Harry's account of the first time he had sex.
"An older woman took his virginity and then, when the act of darkness had been completed, he lay on his front and she smacked his bottom," said one, the writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth, to peals of laughter.
Preorders have already catapulted the book to the top of best-seller lists, and the ubiquitous coverage is unlikely to damage sales, at least in the short term.
"I'm sure they don't mind all the publicity," said Jeffrey W. Schneider, a co-founder of the public relations firm The Lead PR, speaking of the book's publisher, Penguin Random House. "It is also true that what is good for a publisher is not necessarily the same as what is good for the person who has published the book."
Indeed, more worrying for Harry and Meghan is whether the continued public re-litigation of their troubles has grown so repetitive or even tiresome that it has eroded their personal brand and damaged their potential future earnings. Once they have exhausted the topic of themselves, what is left for them to talk about?
"It's overload," Schneider said. "There's been a lot about them, and now there's a lot more. While people's fascination has always been pretty high, maybe there is a natural limit to that."
If he had been advising Harry and Meghan, said Howard Bragman, the chairman of the crisis-management firm La Brea Media, he would have impressed on them that there is only so much mileage you can get out of a finite amount of material.
"You have to realize that you can really only tell your story once," Bragman said.
There is also the question of timing. Harry's book is being published shortly after the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. Whatever you think of the monarchy, Elizabeth's funeral gave the royal family the chance to showcase qualities like discretion, fortitude, an adherence to duty and tradition, and an aptitude for remaining publicly stoic in the face of private grief.
But Harry embodies the opposite of all that. With his revelations about private family conversations, his accounts of his anguish and unhappiness at the behavior of his father, stepmother and brother, especially in the wake of his mother's death, and his eagerness to divulge un-regal details about topics like Meghan and Kate's high-drama altercation over the bridesmaids' dresses at his and Meghan's wedding, he presents a stark contrast to William and, especially, to Kate, who in public have said exactly nothing about any of this.
"It feels a little reality-television-y to me," Bragman said of the Harry-and-Meghan media offensive. The couple, he added, "feel a little Trumpian, in that they seem like they can't let a grudge go."
Alas, even one of the queens of reality television, the former "Real Housewives of New York City" star Bethenny Frankel, believes that Harry and Meghan have finally said too much.
"Is it too late to change the name of Harry's book to 'Dirty Harry Laundry?"' Frankel said in a video on Instagram, filming herself as she lay in bed. She decried the level of detail in the book. "How much more? Are we going with Meghan to get a Pap smear? I mean, what's next?" ("Okay, but how is this any different than the reality shows that you did?" a commenter named wendyjo79 responded, which seemed like a fair point.)
Many people have defended Meghan and Harry on social media and elsewhere in the last few days. But for every person who sticks up for the couple, there is someone else who says that enough is enough.
"We've all just fallen down some wormhole where we will never be free of hearing every single detail of Prince Harry's life and why he believes no one has ever had a worse life than his," the former "View" co-host Meghan McCain said on Twitter. "This is never going to end. He's never going to let us live!"

For Prince Harry's Book, Chaos and Brisk Sales: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: A litany of leaks and interview clips before the book's publication has made the process hard for the publisher to control, but has also driven early interest.
The details streaming from leaks and interview teasers in advance of Prince Harry's memoir, "Spare," have been sensational, even explosive. News organizations around the world have covered them breathlessly.
There's Harry's description of his brother, William, knocking him to the floor during a fight, and Harry's admission that he killed 25 people in Afghanistan. There's also his claim that William and his wife, Kate, encouraged him to dress up as a Nazi, and his recollection of losing his virginity to an older woman in a field behind a bar.
A tell-all by a member of the British royal family was bound to be a nightmare to manage. Big books, widely anticipated books, will often leak, despite publishers' best attempts to keep the process tightly orchestrated. But the contents of Harry's memoir have been excavated to such a degree that it has raised the question: Will readers still be curious enough to buy the book?
So far, it looks like the answer is yes. The media frenzy seems to be driving interest in the memoir, which is due out Tuesday. "Spare" held the No. 1 spot on Amazon in the United States and Britain on Friday, as well as at Barnes & Noble. Booksellers and distributors said that preorders are enormous and growing with the avalanche of press coverage.
Still, the extraordinary volume of leaks highlighted the challenges, and perhaps the impossibility, of choreographing the release of what may be the most anticipated and divisive celebrity memoir of all time.
Many of the memoir's eye-popping revelations have already spilled in leaks, and some of the most dramatic moments from the interviews Harry gave promoting the book have circulated online as teasers. This was all preceded by a six-part Netflix documentary, "Harry & Meghan," which aired in December, and where Harry made incendiary accusations against his family, including a claim that his brother's communications aides planted negative stories about his wife, Meghan Markle, in the London tabloids.
Despite the risk that blanket coverage could lead to Harry and Meghan fatigue, many booksellers expect the memoir to be an unmitigated success. Random House has said it is printing 2.5 million hardcover copies for North America alone. Ingram, the book wholesaler, has 90,000 copies in its warehouses to restock stores that run out. ReaderLink, which distributes books to chain stores like Target and Walmart, said it had ordered about 300,000 copies. Barnes & Noble has also ordered hundreds of thousands of copies.
James Daunt, who heads Barnes & Noble and the British bookstore chain Waterstones, said that even the negative leaks have been driving up customer interest in "Spare," and that he expects to see "the most extraordinary" first-day and first-week sales.
After The Guardian obtained a copy of the book and revealed some of its biggest bombshells, reservations for in-store purchases of the book shot up in Britain, he said.
"This one has really whipped up a level of press hysteria that I really struggle to think of one that's comparable," Daunt said. "All it does is build up this great excitement, which gets people into bookstores."
Ever since Penguin Random House announced in 2021 that they had acquired a memoir by Harry -- who stunned the world when he and his wife announced they were parting ways with the royal family -- the book's content has been the subject of intense speculation in the publishing world, in the British tabloids and among royal watchers.
Publishers often guard against leaks with strict embargoes, in some cases requiring anyone who works on the book, including typesetters and copy editors, to sign nondisclosure agreements. Retailers are often required to sign an affidavit agreeing to store books in a monitored, locked and secure area if they get copies before the on-sale date. Some publishing executives even choose not to send highly anticipated books to airport bookstores because they tend to pay less attention to embargoes.
Matt Latimer, a founder of the literary agency Javelin, which has handled many books by high-profile politicians, said he has never seen an embargoed book leak from within a publishing house or printing plant. It's in the days before publication, when the books have to be put on trucks and shipped to stores, that the revelations start.
"I call this the danger zone," Latimer said. "The week or two before publication, there is almost always a leak."
A simultaneous international release complicates this delicate process further. "Spare" will be released in 16 languages at the same time, multiplying opportunities for leaks: In Spain, the book accidentally went on sale early on Thursday.
Publishing executives say that leaks can be beneficial if they drive the right kind of media coverage, and drum up interest in the book. During the Trump era, some of the most explosive information in tell-all books by journalists and former administration officials often leaked out early and dominated cable news coverage for days, which catapulted titles to the top of the best seller lists. But in some cases, books that are built around news nuggets can see their sales nosedive after the news cycle is exhausted and the media has moved on.
It's too soon to say whether the overall sales trajectory of Harry's memoir will be affected by the steady drip of revelations. Many readers will buy the book for an intimate view of Prince Harry's life from his perspective, not just for bomblets of news. Harry has partnered with a highly regarded ghostwriter, J.R. Moehringer, and a cascade of articles does not offer the same narrative journey as a well-crafted book. And his story, while ripe for tabloid fodder, also deals with universal themes like race, class, and the sometimes tortured relationships between brothers or between fathers and sons. The book's title refers to a phrase that Charles is reported to have used to refer to Harry, his second son, as his "spare," or back up heir, since he'd already secured an heir in Harry's older brother.
"It's ridiculous and it's fun, but it's also clearly going to be an interesting book that's going to keep on selling and it's going to keep on being part of the conversation," said Daunt, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble.
"We're making a bet that this book has got legs," he said. "It's not going to be a flash in the pan."

It's a balmy January afternoon. You buy an avocado and pickled turnip sandwich from Gjelina and some legal weed at a high-end smoke shop. After popping by a Fred Segal boutique, you meet friends for early mocktails under the trees at San Vicente Bungalows.
It's an ideal Los Angeles day. And soon you won't have to leave Manhattan for it.
New York City may think of itself as singular, but it's increasingly possible to live the Los Angeles lifestyle here without the inconvenience of a cross-country flight. New Yorkers drive more and ride the subway less. They're eating earlier, dressing sloppier and doing ketamine. The mayor parties at a Kardashian hangout, and there's an organic mattress store on Fifth Avenue.
Is this the Los Ang-ularity?
Cultural exchange between the two cities dates back decades, and innovations like juice bars, fad diets and luxe leisure wear long ago brought a California feel to the gilded Manhattan of Carrie Bradshaw and Blair Waldorf.
But these days, in the bicoastal vibe wars, New York is giving L.A.
New York's first legal recreational pot store opened last month, bringing a staple of Los Angeles living to Lower Broadway. New car registrations spiked 28 percent in Manhattan between 2019 and 2021. A beach is being built off the West Side Highway, beneath the Whitney Museum.
Eleven Madison Park, Manhattan's pinnacle of four-star dining, went vegan. Midtown is chockablock with Los Angeles culinary favorites like Katsuya, Dave's Hot Chicken and Sugarfish. Keith McNally, the ultimate New York restaurateur, has a son who just married a Spielberg. Netflix bought the Paris Theater -- the city's last single-screen movie house -- and built a 170,000-square-foot soundstage in Bushwick.
Even the clearest distinction between the two cities -- climate -- has been smoggier of late. On Wednesday, Los Angeles reached a high of 61 degrees; in New York, the mercury hit 66.
OK, so Manhattan will never have palm trees. (Soon, Los Angeles may not either!) But a convergence of forces -- social, economic, epidemiological -- seem to be bringing the cultures of the two cities closer together.
First, the pandemic: the time of Peloton, suburban fantasies and acute health consciousness. Deprived of their usual energies and social delights, New Yorkers lusted for wide open spaces and spiritual awakenings, innovative exercise regimens and controlled environments.
"The entire pandemic was the L.A. lifestyle," said the Bravo host and longtime New Yorker Andy Cohen. "We stayed at home and did nothing!"
Sue Chan, a food industry event specialist who splits her time between the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles and the Lower East Side of Manhattan, said that New Yorkers' isolation during Covid fueled an obsession with "self-improvement, self-care and self-love: a.k.a., the epitome of Californian living, where one can go for days without seeing a single human."
Enter the wave of woo-woo.
Luxe wellness spots have proliferated. At Sage + Sound on the Upper East Side, the owners blessed black tourmaline crystals and buried them under the floor before opening the 5,000-square-foot store in October.
Remedy Place, the Los Angeles health club that opened in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in September, offers lymphatic drainage suits and hyperbaric chambers to members who pay fees of several thousand dollars a year; one sound healing class features "harmonic frequencies of multiple Himalayan singing bowls." The club's motto -- "When we remedy together, we amplify the shared experience" -- promises togetherness, the kind of Los Angeles thing that New Yorkers once loved to avoid.
"There was always a cynical New York nostril flare about horoscopes and anything considered more Southern California, and that's been completely normalized," said Jill Kargman, the actress, writer and native New Yorker, citing acquaintances who now dabble in ayahuasca and kambo, an Amazonian frog toxin used for purging. "People microdose to get through a P.T.A. meeting."
Even Mayor Eric Adams -- a self-described vegan who secretly eats fish -- recently told New Yorkers: "I deserve good work-life balance."
New Yorkers have also adopted another habit of Los Angeles living: early dining.
Lauren Young, a spokeswoman for Resy, the reservation app owned by American Express, said that New Yorkers have "shifted a little toward earlier times, whereas L.A. historically already did dine earlier." From 2019 to 2022, 5 p.m. reservations in New York City increased by 1.9 percent. "This might not seem like a big shift, but it amounts to thousands of reservations," Ms. Young said.
"New York used to love to pretend it had a European-style, 9 or 10 p.m. dinner culture," said Chris Black, a New York fashion consultant and a host of the "How Long Gone" podcast who now lives in West Hollywood. A recent return visit was less Marais, more Marina del Rey: Mercer Kitchen and Il Buco "wouldn't seat me for dinner at 7 p.m., because it was so busy," he said.
Manhattan's next big Los Angeles moment will be the opening of San Vicente Bungalows, the West Hollywood private clubhouse that is a favorite of Hollywood's apex predators. Its owner, Jeff Klein, is opening a branch at the Jane Hotel, whose rooftop will be adorned with soil and trees to better replicate the verdant original. Gabé Doppelt, a former Condé Nast editor and gatekeeper of Tower Bar on Sunset Boulevard, another Klein property, is set to move to Manhattan to ensure the social caliber of the new establishment.
Avocado Green Mattress sells California-made "vegan mattresses" at its Fifth Avenue "experience center." Detox Market, an Abbot Kinney favorite, has become part of the East Houston Street landscape. Nushama, a psychedelic wellness center featuring $ 4,500 ketamine treatments, opened in Midtown in 2021 and plans to expand to the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn.
Steven Phillips-Horst, a host of the podcast "Celebrity Book Club with Steven & Lily," said the collision of West Coast wellness culture with New York decadence has resulted in something he calls "responsible hedonism."
"People definitely want their green juice and their matcha negronis," he said. "There's an element of indulgence to both cities that fuses a more traditional '90s L.A. idea of green juice and health food and the New York, old-school brasserie vibe, putting that together in this incomprehensible TikTok slop."
A useful case study is NoHo, the downtown Manhattan neighborhood once home to Jean-Michel Basquiat and Robert Mapplethorpe that has recently turned into LiLA: Little L.A.
Gjelina, the vaunted organic food destination on Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice, opened its New York outpost on New Year's Eve on Bond Street, a few doors down from fellow Los Angeles imports Reformation and Goop. Hillsong, the megachurch once favored by Angeleno A-listers like Justin Bieber and Vanessa Hudgens (at least until its pastor's scandalous downfall), is opening a new headquarters off Great Jones Street. There's an Edie Parker Boutique that sells $ 795 luxury bongs and a Bowery "wellness dispensary" with affirming neon signs like "Goodies Vibes Only."
That first legal recreational pot shop? It's around the corner just off Astor Place.
The trend extends south to SoHo, where Fred Segal, the longtime West Hollywood fashion mecca, opened its first Manhattan location in November. Inside, shoppers can browse brightly colored cotton basics named for Los Angeles neighborhoods ("Pico" tee, $ 180) and a $ 48 baseball cap embroidered with the word "Free." The shop, a pop-up that will be open at least through April, abuts a parking lot, "so it sort of felt like home," said the owner, Jeff Lotman.
The new Fred Segal is near a new Staud, the highly Instagrammable West Coast fashion brand whose founder, Sarah Staudinger, recently married the Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel. Irene Neuwirth, the popular Los Angeles jewelry designer, debuted her first Manhattan store in December; Jennifer Fisher, another jewelry designer, whose clients include Selena Gomez and Lisa Rinna, just opened a new SoHo flagship.
Kate Berlant, the Angeleno actress and comedian, attended New York University. But she discovered a different East Village after returning in the fall for her current one-woman show, "Kate." "There's this matcha hellscape -- and I love matcha!" she said. "It really depresses me, all that athleisure and wellness. There's that eerie feeling of an aesthetic taking over the culture entirely."
The L.A.-ward tilt is also evident in New York's culinary scene, where nonalcoholic, or NA, cocktails are now de rigueur. "Juices and tonics are California clichés, but now it's nearly impossible to see a beverage menu in New York City without a NA section," Ms. Chan said.
Corner Bar, the scene-y Dimes Square spot, features three spirit-free spirits on its cocktail menu, including an $ 18 "amaretti sour" that mixes nonalcoholic bourbon, almond, lemon and honey; the newly reopened Monkey Bar in Midtown offers a $ 19 "phony Negroni." Compare that to old-school haunts like Sparks Steak House, whose "beverage and cigar" list includes a single virgin drink: nonalcoholic St. Pauli Girl beer.
Even the latest booze served in Manhattan is supposedly better for you: Body, a low-proof vodka that touts "non-GMO Indiana corn" as an ingredient -- and was founded by Jilly Hendrix, a close friend of the "Hills" star Lauren Conrad -- is stocked at the Rockefeller Center cocktail emporium Pebble Bar and the new Aman New York on Fifth Avenue.
Maer Roshan, the editor of Los Angeles magazine, said he was not surprised that New York, his former home, was taking cues from its West Coast rival. "Everyone I know here had a shaman five years ago," he said. "And now I'm hearing from my friends in New York, 'We found this great shaman in Long Island!"'
Ms. Kargman pledged to do her part to beat back that trend.
"I dress up, hate vegan, loathe pot and don't work out," she said. "I was just asked if I wanted to do a mommy mushroom journey. Kill me now!"
Still, the true Los Ang-ularity may not occur until New York gains its very own branch of the ultimate Los Angeles symbol of health and wealth: the upscale organic grocery store Erewhon.
"That's the final frontier," Mr. Black said, echoing other commentators who wondered why it hadn't happened already.
On that front, there may be some hope.
"It's a big and exciting question, huh?!" an Erewhon executive, Demi Marie Alhaik, said when asked about the prospect. She added that while Erewhon has no current plans for a New York opening, "it is certainly on our radar."
"It will happen," Ms. Alhaik said. "It's just a matter of when."

Full text: A VHS tape of "Peter and the Wolf," the Disney animated short from 1946, played on repeat at home when Diego Calva was growing up in the 1990s.
Both terrified and tantalized by that first cinematic obsession as a child, Calva discovered the power of audiovisual storytelling in the unnerving leitmotif of the villainous wolf.
"Without being able to put in words, it made me realize that I was a little box of feelings and that movies could make them surface," Calva explained, speaking in Spanish. "That hooked me."
After only one major independent movie, the actor from Mexico City is now starring alongside Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie in his first mega-budget American production: the director Damien Chazelle's silent-era revel "Babylon," about the grotesque origins of the Hollywood film industry and why movies fascinate us.
Calva, 30, received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor in a musical or comedy for his performance as the Mexican-born Manny Torres, who slowly moves up the ranks in 1920s Hollywood -- from catch-all production assistant to influential producer.
His character functions as the story's driving force: as both the link between Pitt's and Robbie's characters -- two successful, often deranged actors -- and as the viewer's guide to this decadent world. Calva gives Manny an adoring naïveté about the movies, which fuels the character's determination to become a part of them, even if his devotion eventually backfires.
While Calva worked hard to win the part, performing wasn't his original dream. Long before Hollywood called, Calva had ambitions to become a writer-director, as he explained in an interview at a hotel in Beverly Hills. The tall, easygoing novice wore a preppy look composed of a gray sweater vest over a white T-shirt, black slacks and a pair of shiny black shoes.
From a young age, he surrounded himself with friends a few years older who were making short films. Like Manny, Calva helped out in miscellaneous positions behind the scenes of those independent shoots, whether it was catering or holding a boom mic.
On one such set, he was asked to step in for an actor who hadn't shown up, which led to more jobs, mostly unpaid, in front of the camera. He eventually landed his first lead in a feature film, appearing in the director Julio Hernández Cordón's 2015 gay drama "I Promise You Anarchy," a festival hit.
The story follows two male skateboarders in a tumultuous romance, as they become involved with criminals trafficking human blood on the black market.
On a friend's recommendation, Hernández Cordón checked out Calva's Facebook profile. Afterward, the director eagerly reached out to Calva, who had been skating since early adolescence.
"Within five minutes of meeting Diego, I knew he was the right person for the part because of his confidence and charisma," Hernández Cordón said on a video call from Mexico City.
While there was no formal casting process, Calva and his co-star, Eduardo Eliseo Martinez, had to agree to the intimate scenes in the screenplay. Their openness to portraying intense desire solidified the director's trust in them.
"I've always considered myself a bit punk and I love skating," Calva said, "so the movie was like bringing to life some situations I was already going through at the time."
As Hernández Cordón pointed out, Calva straddles the line between his middle-class upbringing, raised by a single mother who instilled in him an affinity for the arts, and the street smarts attained by wandering a large metropolis with kids from other socioeconomic backgrounds.
"I knew Diego had an innate talent, but I worried that he wouldn't realize the gift he has," Hernández Cordón said. "I'm very happy that he's starting a new chapter with 'Babylon."'
That introduction to performing professionally, however, didn't dazzle Calva enough to make him push his filmmaking aspirations aside.
He went on to enroll at the Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica, one of Mexico's pre-eminent film schools, to study directing. But to stay afloat financially, Calva took on acting work, which created a conflict with the institution's policies.
Ultimately, he chose to leave the school and returned to acting full time, appearing on TV series and in supporting parts on the big screen, and putting on acting workshops for children.
It was during this period of doubt about his future that the opportunity to audition for the third season of the Netflix hit series "Narcos: Mexico" arrived. He aced it. And while playing the real-life drug lord Arturo Beltrán Leyva on the show introduced him to production on a larger scale, Calva couldn't anticipate what would soon come his way.
As Damien Chazelle searched, in late 2019, for a fresh face to star in "Babylon," he came across Calva's image amid a stack of headshots. The Oscar-winning director was struck by the actor's gaze.
"There was something of a dreamer in his eyes, something of a poet," Chazelle said via video. "But I had no idea if he could act."
The character he envisioned Calva for, Manny, is partly inspired by two Latin American filmmakers whose careers started to take off in the 1920s: Enrique Juan Vallejo, the Mexican cinematographer and director, and René Cardona, the prolific Cuban-born director.
Calva submitted several self-taped auditions and eventually met with Chazelle online during the early months of the Covid pandemic. The more intrigued Chazelle became by Calva, the more it also became apparent that the actor had limited experience and that his English needed work.
Chazelle and Olivia Hamilton, his wife and a producer of the film, "debated whether it was a gamble worth taking with Diego," Chazelle said. "She had this full 100 percent unwavering belief in him."
Several months into the casting process, Calva began to feel overwhelmed by the life-changing magnitude of the opportunity, which seemed closer to materializing but not yet certain. Aside from executing Chazelle's increasingly specific notes about his line delivery, improving his English became a priority.
In late 2020, Calva finally traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Chazelle and Robbie, who would play Nellie LaRoy, a fictional starlet and Manny's love interest.
Using his cellphone, Chazelle filmed the chemistry read between Calva and Robbie in his backyard. Their palpable energy convinced him that Calva could deliver on his potential.
"He had this kind of Al Pacino-level ability to command the camera without seeming to do anything," Chazelle said. In fact, Pacino's arc from innocence to corruption as Michael Corleone in "The Godfather" films served as a key reference for Calva's turn.
Robbie admired Calva's ability to improvise in his second language.
"It's so transformative to act with him because he's so present that you forget you're doing a scene," Robbie said. "He was the greatest scene partner I could ever wish for."
For Calva, the parallels between him and Manny feel almost like docu-fiction. "I identify with him in wanting to belong in the world of the movies," he said. The actor's wide-eyed reactions to an epic set piece early in the sweeping story came from genuine emotion.
"My first day on a Hollywood set was also the character's first day on a Hollywood set," Calva explained. "All of the expressions of surprise you see on my face are real."
By the time one of the final scenes was shot, in which Manny watches the musical "Singin' in the Rain" and cries, Calva had been immersed in the universe of Chazelle's movie for nearly eight months. For that emotional moment, the director asked him to replay "Babylon" in its entirety, from Manny's point of view, via facial expressions.
"It's such a crazy piece of direction, and he does it," Robbie said. "You feel everything you've felt for the last three hours play out on his face in a few seconds."
"I needed an actor who could really dig deep and summon something," Chazelle said. "It's the hardest kind of acting to do because you don't have the benefit of words, language or even body movement. You have to do it all just in your face, in your eyes."
As Manny rises in Hollywood, he loses perspective, even denying his Mexican identity and claiming to be from Spain. Calva, grounded in advice from his mother, whom he considers his best friend, said he believed that wouldn't happen to him.
"I don't want to lose my childlike outlook on life, my ability for wonder," Calva said. "I want to remember the road back home and know that if I make mistakes I won't lose myself."
For now, Calva plans to remain in Mexico City and build his burgeoning career, but whenever he's wanted on this side of the border, the actor will joyfully oblige.
"They invited me to this party," Calva said with a hint of mischievous glee. "Getting me out of Hollywood is going to be difficult."

Full text: With questions swirling about the utility of voice assistants, we asked readers how they use one of the most popular, Amazon's Alexa. Here's what they answered.
When Amazon released Alexa in 2014, the company had big dreams for the technology. The voice assistant, the company suggested, could succeed smartphones as the next essential consumer interface.
Alexa, which was embedded in Amazon's voice-activated Echo smart speakers, soon became one of the most popular voice assistants, alongside Apple's Siri and Google's Assistant.
But nearly a decade on, questions have arisen about the utility of voice assistants, including how often people use Alexa to shop for items or buy subscriptions. In November, Amazon began corporate layoffs, some of which targeted the division that makes Alexa and the Echo speakers.
An Amazon representative referred to comments its executives have made that the company is not giving up on Alexa and that it will continue developing new features for it.
We decided to ask readers how they use and interact with Alexa and how the technology fits into their lives. Nearly 200 people in the United States and Europe responded.
Those who relied on the voice assistant said they used it mainly for mundane tasks such as setting timers and checking the weather. Many said they had grown attached to Alexa and missed it when they were away. Most said they did not use Alexa to help them with shopping. Others told us, just as emphatically, that they would never use an Alexa device.
Here's a selection of the responses in readers' own words, which have been edited and condensed for clarity.
A partner when living alone
Susan Jackson lives on Bainbridge Island, Wash. She has two Alexa-enabled devices.
I am 73, live alone, and I use Alexa every day to tell me the weather, turn on the lights, tell me the time in foreign countries so I can call people there, and for cooking. Lots of cooking problems solved by Alexa. She helps me cut down recipes; she patiently tells me how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon.
I use it for some reading lights and ALWAYS for my Christmas tree. Nothing worse than crawling under your tree to turn it off and on.
If I met someone, he or she would have to fit into my life. They would have to love my house, my dogs, my Alexa, my drawing, my friends ... or they can go to hell!
An arbiter during debates
David Webster lives in Cornwall, England, with his wife and their three children. He said they use their Alexa devices multiple times a day.
Many, many basic things we use it for. We would be lost without it.
It's things like timers. I know that if the oven is on, there's at least one Alexa timer going. If Janine, my wife, is cooking something, many of her recipes are from American cookbooks, and she will need to convert them to the metric system.
I could do it on the phone. But I've got wet hands, or my wife has flour on her hands. We're opening the oven. I don't want to touch another device -- talking to it is so convenient.
If we are having a discussion around the dining room table, and she's in the next room, just shout out "Alexa ..."
Caring for a parent with dementia
Elizabeth lives in Minneapolis. She asked that her last name not be used to protect her mother's privacy. Elizabeth does not use Alexa in her own home, but she has two devices with screens in her mother's apartment. She and her sister use the Alexa app on their phones to manage their mother's devices remotely.
My mother has dementia, and Alexa allows us to keep her safe, to give her companionship, to make her days brighter with music -- the list goes on and on. It is not an overstatement to say it is helping us keep her out of a nursing home.
We primarily use the app to make "Announcements": These are phrases we type into the app that the machine then says aloud. We use this feature in the moment and also on a repeat schedule. The Echo device also shows the announcement text on the screen, so my mother can read it (a big help). Examples are little announcements about the weather and such that keep her company. The fact that a warm voice is in the room with her seems to give her a sense of companionship that the phone does not.
Using the app's "Drop In" feature and our iPhone cameras, we can appear on one of her Echo devices (using additional Blink cameras, we can see which room she's in) and initiate a call without her having to do anything on her end. We'll use this if she's left the phone off the hook or if we feel it's necessary or helpful for her to see us.
We also use the "Routines" feature to control the lights in my mother's apartment. According to her doctor, keeping her home well lit is important to managing her confusion and avoiding napping during the day. The routines feature helps us avoid having to make call after call to remind her of activities.
Alexa's on staff
Maria Kinaman lives in Miami with her husband and two young daughters. They have six Alexa devices.
Alexa feels as if she's on staff at this point. We overuse her for music, but also as a timer, for the weather, to play white noise, and we have synced it with our home security system and use it to lock and set the alarm for our doors. Not once have I made a purchase off it, though.
I have taken Alexa with me on vacations that are longer than two days.
A total immersion
Brendan T. Freeman lives in Burien, Wash., with his two dogs. He has 60 devices controlled by Alexa in his home, including lights, fans and heaters.
I wake every morning at 3:30 to drink coffee and read The New York Times. I walk into the kitchen and say the wake word -- "shake" -- which turns on and dims three fixtures (one in the kitchen so I can see, one in the living room and one in the bedroom). The coffee is freshly brewed, turned on by the Alexa app at 3:20.
While I lie in my bed with my laptop reading the news, the Alexa app turns on a Pandora light jazz station at 4 a.m. If I happen to oversleep, the music serves as my alarm clock.
When I first sit down in my office at 7 a.m., I look at my calendar and ask Echo to set alarms 10 minutes before any scheduled meetings I have. If there is something I need to remember to do during the day (buy dog food, call the doctor's office), I'll ask Alexa to set a reminder at a certain time.
When I go to bed, I say, "Echo bedtime," and all the lights throughout the condo turn off.
Checking on kids
Yiu Wai Chan lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two children, ages 11 and 7. They own 13 Alexa-enabled devices and nine other smart devices.
We use it to turn on and off our living room lights and to drop in (talk from our phone to the Alexa Dot devices) from the car to check in on our kids sometimes.
We have no plans to shop with it, as we like to really research our purchases and see items in person or at least in videos or in pictures online before buying.
Clever life hacks
Michael Redmond lives in Rehoboth Beach, Del., with his husband. They have seven Alexa devices and three Google smart devices.
We have a Wyze camera trained on the sump pump in our crawl space, whose feed we display on an Alexa Show. It's a pain to physically go into the basement to check the pump.
We don't use it to shop on Amazon. It's too hard to compare prices using the device.
We take an Alexa Dot with us when we travel.
Four devices in one Brooklyn apartment
Kerry Hoffman lives in Brooklyn with her husband and cat. They have four Alexa-enabled devices.
My husband set up automatic blinds that are controlled by Alexa. Not only can she open and close the blinds fully, she can adjust the shades up and down, too. We say, "Alexa, set living room blinds to 3 percent," and she'll open the shades so we can see outside.
It's too risky
Aaron Lawless lives in Springfield, Va., with his wife and two children.
In an era of massive hacks and data breaches, having an always-listening device connected to the internet sitting in my house is not worth the risk.
My wife is with me on not wanting an Alexa, but my 10-year-old has mentioned that it might be fun to have Alexa. He hears his friends talk about having Alexa, and he's sold on the coolness of it. Mom and I are in agreement that it's not happening, though.
And not even helpful
Heather Keever lives in the Chicago suburbs with her husband and 15-year-old son.
It is very important to keep Alexa, Echo, etc., devices out of our family. We've returned ones "gifted" to us; we don't want them.
I tried my brother's Alexa when we were visiting him to set an oven timer. It worked, but setting the actual timer on the oven worked just as well (maybe easier).
I'm not willing to give up my privacy for things I can easily do without.
My fingers work just fine
Richard Feury lives in Shelburne Falls, Mass., with his wife.
Don't need one. Don't want one. Wish they would go away.
I'm not so lazy that I want a machine to turn on the lights, lock the doors or switch from Hulu to Netflix for me. My legs and fingers still work just fine.
And I don't want a device like Alexa to be used by corporations to learn more about my habits, lifestyle, political leanings, etc. I value what little privacy I still have, and Alexa erodes that.

Full text: Looking for something to do in New York? Get some social guidance from Colin Quinn, or catch Holiday Lights at the Bronx Zoo before it wraps up for the season.
Comedy
'Small Talk'
Jan. 6-Feb. 11 at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Manhattan; lortel.org.
Colin Quinn has had a prominent voice in pop culture since 1987, first as an announcer on the MTV game show "Remote Control," then as the Weekend Update anchor for "Saturday Night Live" in the late 1990s, and then as the ring master of a raucous rotating panel of stand-ups on Comedy Central's "Tough Crowd With Colin Quinn" in the early 2000s.
Quinn knows how to keep the conversation lively. So in his new one-hander, "Small Talk," which opens on Friday, the comedian vows to teach everyone "how to stop sucking the energy out of the room." Since 2010, his Broadway and Off Broadway runs have resulted in specials on HBO ("Long Story Short"), Netflix ("Unconstitutional" and "The New York Story") and CNN ("Red State, Blue State").
Performances are on Fridays at 7 and 9 p.m., on Saturdays at 3 and 7 p.m. and Mondays through Thursdays at 7 p.m. Tickets start at $ 39 and are available at ovationtix.com. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Exo-Tech
Jan. 7 at 7:30 p.m. at Public Records, 233 Butler Street, Brooklyn; publicrecords.nyc.
This isn't your father's jam session: Exo-Tech, a rotating collective of progressive pop makers and jazz artists, retrofits the concept with a small army of synthesizers and a doggedly experimental impulse. The brainchild of the pop eccentric Kimbra and the Australian musician and curator Sophia Brous, Exo-Tech first assembled in 2016 for a show at National Sawdust; over the years, its all-star cast has included Questlove, David Byrne and Caroline Polachek.
On Saturday, Brous will bring her crew to Public Records, where they will perform an improvisatory set in the round, as is their custom. Taja Cheek, who makes elliptical, avant-garde compositions under the name L'Rain; Spencer Zahn, the composer who last year collaborated with Dawn Richard on a joint album, "Pigments"; Mauro Refosco, the Atoms for Peace percussionist and a performer in David Byrne's "American Utopia"; and others are slated to participate. Tickets are about $ 31 and available at dice.fm. OLIVIA HORN
Billy Harper
Jan. 5-8 at Smoke, 2751 Broadway, Manhattan; smokejazz.com.
On his early recordings, made in the first half of the 1970s with leaders such as Lee Morgan and Gil Evans, Billy Harper already had a massive sound on the tenor saxophone, combining John Coltrane's spiraling intensity with a bluesy brawn that pointed back to his Texas origins. Harper's authority has only grown with age: A half-century on, he stands as one of the most commanding horn men on the planet, a pillar of stirring post-bop jazz whose robust back catalog seems long overdue for rediscovery.
Often heard with an exemplary all-star collective, the Cookers, Harper will helm his own band this weekend, as part of Smoke's annual Coltrane festival. Among the players is the drummer Billy Hart, a fellow Cooker and a 2022 N.E.A. Jazz Master. Expect to hear Coltrane staples alongside timeless Harper originals like "Priestess," "Croquet Ballet" and "Call of the Wild and Peaceful Heart," as the master musician celebrates his 80th birthday.
Sets are at 7 and 9 p.m. on Thursday and Sunday and at 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Tickets start at $ 35 for in-person shows and are $ 15 for the livestreams on Friday and Saturday. They are available at Smoke's website. HANK SHTEAMER
Kids
Holiday Lights
Jan. 6-8 at the Bronx Zoo, Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road; bronxzoo.com.
This is the final weekend to see a variety of animals in a whole new light. The Bronx Zoo's dazzling display of more than 360 silk-and-steel lanterns in the form of wildlife -- as well as creature silhouettes created by glittering LEDs -- will shine for the last time on Friday and Saturday from 3 to 10 p.m. and on Sunday from 3 to 9 p.m.
One of the region's annual luminous shows, the latest Holiday Lights, which comprises six trails throughout the zoo, features 30 new species, including African elephants, Malayan tapirs and Andean bears. Divided into geographic areas and ecosystems, the exhibition also has a Forest of Color filled with brilliantly hued residents like the regal sunbird and the morpho butterfly.
In addition to glowing fauna, young visitors can enjoy sparkling trees, ice-carving demonstrations, Wildlife Theater puppet performances and stilt walkers. Illuminated Playground, a concluding festival within the festival, will transform the Schiff Family Great Hall into a palace of twinkling swings and seesaws from 5 to 8:30 each evening.
Tickets for timed entry, which must be purchased in advance, start at $ 24.95; holiday train rides (on site), at $ 3. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
The Lost Rider: A Chronicle of Hollywood Sacrifice
Jan. 5-14 at Film at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan; filmlinc.org.
If you had trouble wrapping your head around Jordan Peele's "Nope," the eclectic selections he made for this series may or may not offer clarification. An animated version of Eadweard Muybridge's "Plate Number 626" -- a photographic locomotion study featured in "Nope" -- will play before 35-millimeter screenings of the 1933 version of "King Kong" (on Friday). The pointedly political 1972 western "Buck and the Preacher" (on Saturday), directed by Sidney Poitier, stars Poitier as a wagon master and Harry Belafonte as an ersatz clergyman who eventually join forces. A "secret short selection" will be paired with Elem Klimov's relentlessly upsetting war film "Come and See" on Sunday.
"Nope" itself will screen on 70 millimeter, with Peele, Keke Palmer and others present at showings on Thursday that have mostly sold out. (The print will play again on Jan. 14.) Peele has also selected no fewer than four movies with Corey Feldman: "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter" (on Sunday), "Stand by Me" (on Tuesday), "Dream a Little Dream" (also on Tuesday) and "The Birthday" (on Jan. 13). Feldman will make an appearance at every screening except for the one of "Friday the 13th." BEN KENIGSBERG

Major Indexes Rally After Report on Jobs: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/major-indexes-rally-after-report-on-jobs/docview/2760720651/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street closed broadly higher Wednesday after wavering for much of the day as investors weighed the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting of policymakers and welcomed encouraging data on job openings.
The major indexes rallied following a government report showing that job openings increased more than expected in November. Stocks then shed some of their gains after the minutes from the Fed meeting last month underscored how the central bank remains determined to keep rates high to crush inflation.
The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent after having been down 0.2 percent in the early going. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq composite added 0.7 percent. Small company stocks outpaced the broader market, lifting the Russell 2000 index 1.2 percent higher.
The Fed raised its key short-term interest rate last month for the seventh time in 2022 and signaled more hikes to come. Still, the increase was smaller than those announced after its previous four meetings, reflecting signs that inflation, while still high, has been showing signs of easing.
The minutes from the mid-December meeting show that Fed officials remained determined to keep rates high and have taken little comfort from inflation's decline from a peak of 9.1 percent in June to 7.1 percent in November.
Stocks marched higher before the 2 p.m. Eastern release of the Fed minutes after the government reported that the number of job openings in November was higher than expected. While that could maintain pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates high to fight inflation, the resilience in the labor market also bolsters hopes on Wall Street that the economy can avoid sliding into a protracted recession.
"I think the market is trying to figure out if the recession indeed comes, will it be a bad one," said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial. "I think investors are right, that if we do fall into a recession, it's not going to be a deep and prolonged recession."
The latest update on job openings is the first set of employment data that Wall Street will get this week. The government will release its weekly unemployment report on Thursday and its closely watched monthly employment report, for December, on Friday.
The strong jobs market helped insulate a weakening economy from slipping into a recession in 2022. The Fed, though, is trying to lower inflation with its rate increases and that also means it needs to cool employment.
The minutes from the central bank's last policy meeting shows Fed officials suggested that a continuing streak of robust hiring could keep inflation elevated and was a key reason they expected to raise interest rates this year more than they had previously forecast.
The Fed's benchmark lending rate stands at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, up from close to zero following seven increases last year. It forecast that the rate will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023 and it isn't calling for a rate cut before 2024.
Crude oil prices fell and Treasury yields ended lower Wednesday.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, fell to 3.71 percent from 3.75 percent late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, slipped to 4.34 percent from 4.38 percent.
Banks, companies that rely on consumer spending and communications stocks accounted for a big share of the rally. Citigroup rose 2.6 percent, Starbucks added 3.6 percent and Netflix gained 4.9 percent.
Energy stocks fell as the price of U.S. crude oil settled 5.3 percent lower. Chevron fell 1.1 percent. But more than 80 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 notched gains.
The latest updates for the job market come amid more layoffs within the technology sector, which has been dealing with falling demand as inflation squeezes consumers.
Investors cheered several companies that decided to make cuts to their workforces as they face weaker demand. The cloud computing software company Salesforce rose 3.6 percent after it announced it is laying off about 10 percent of its work force. The video hosing platform Vimeo rose 4 percent after reportedly notifying workers about job cuts.

Diego Calva and the Detour That Took Him to ‘Babylon’

Full text: Enlarge this image.
A VHS tape of “Peter and the Wolf,” the Disney animated short from 1946, played on repeat at home when Diego Calva was growing up in the 1990s.
Both terrified and tantalized by that first cinematic obsession as a child, Calva discovered the power of audiovisual storytelling in the unnerving leitmotif of the villainous wolf.
“Without being able to put in words, it made me realize that I was a little box of feelings and that movies could make them surface,” Calva explained, speaking in Spanish. “That hooked me.”
After only one major independent movie, the actor from Mexico City is now starring alongside Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie in his first megabudget American production: director Damien Chazelle’s silent-era revel “Babylon,” about the grotesque origins of the Hollywood film industry and why movies fascinate us.
Calva, 30, received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor in a musical or comedy for his performance as the Mexican-born Manny Torres, who slowly moves up the ranks in 1920s Hollywood — from catchall production assistant to influential producer.
His character functions as the story’s driving force: as both the link between Pitt’s and Robbie’s characters — two successful, often deranged actors — and as the viewer’s guide to this decadent world. Calva gives Manny an adoring naïveté about the movies, which fuels the character’s determination to become a part of them, even if his devotion eventually backfires.
While Calva worked hard to win the part, performing wasn’t his original dream. Long before Hollywood called, Calva had ambitions to become a writer-director, as he explained in an interview at a hotel in Beverly Hills. The tall, easygoing novice wore a preppy look composed of a gray sweater vest over a white T-shirt, black slacks and a pair of shiny black shoes.
From a young age, he surrounded himself with friends a few years older who were making short films. Like Manny, Calva helped out in miscellaneous positions behind the scenes of those independent shoots, whether it was catering or holding a boom mic.
On one such set, he was asked to step in for an actor who hadn’t shown up, which led to more jobs, mostly unpaid, in front of the camera. He eventually landed his first lead in a feature film, appearing in director Julio Hernández Cordón’s 2015 gay drama “I Promise You Anarchy,” a festival hit.
The story follows two male skateboarders in a tumultuous romance, as they become involved with criminals trafficking human blood on the black market.
On a friend’s recommendation, Hernández Cordón checked out Calva’s Facebook profile. Afterward, the director eagerly reached out to Calva, who had been skating since early adolescence.
“Within five minutes of meeting Diego, I knew he was the right person for the part because of his confidence and charisma,” Hernández Cordón said on a video call from Mexico City.
While there was no formal casting process, Calva and his co-star, Eduardo Eliseo Martinez, had to agree to the intimate scenes in the screenplay. Their openness to portraying intense desire solidified the director’s trust in them.
“I’ve always considered myself a bit punk and I love skating,” Calva said, “so the movie was like bringing to life some situations I was already going through at the time.”
As Hernández Cordón pointed out, Calva straddles the line between his middle-class upbringing, raised by a single mother who instilled in him an affinity for the arts, and the street smarts attained by wandering a large metropolis with kids from other socioeconomic backgrounds.
“I knew Diego had an innate talent, but I worried that he wouldn’t realize the gift he has,” Hernández Cordón said. “I’m very happy that he’s starting a new chapter with ‘Babylon.’”
That introduction to performing professionally, however, didn’t dazzle Calva enough to make him push his filmmaking aspirations aside.
He went on to enroll at the Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica, one of Mexico’s preeminent film schools, to study directing. But to stay afloat financially, Calva took on acting work, which created a conflict with the institution’s policies.
Ultimately, he chose to leave the school and returned to acting full time, appearing on TV series and in supporting parts on the big screen, and putting on acting workshops for children.
It was during this period of doubt about his future that the opportunity to audition for the third season of the Netflix hit series “Narcos: Mexico” arrived. He aced it. And while playing real-life drug lord Arturo Beltrán Leyva on the show introduced him to production on a larger scale, Calva couldn’t anticipate what would soon come his way.
As Damien Chazelle searched, in late 2019, for a fresh face to star in “Babylon,” he came across Calva’s image amid a stack of headshots. The Oscar-winning director was struck by the actor’s gaze.
“There was something of a dreamer in his eyes, something of a poet,” Chazelle said via video. “But I had no idea if he could act.”
The character he envisioned Calva for, Manny, is partly inspired by two Latin American filmmakers whose careers started to take off in the 1920s: Enrique Juan Vallejo, a Mexican cinematographer and director, and René Cardona, a prolific Cuban-born director.
Calva submitted several self-taped auditions and eventually met with Chazelle online during the early months of the COVID pandemic. The more intrigued Chazelle became by Calva, the more it also became apparent that the actor had limited experience and that his English needed work.
Chazelle and Olivia Hamilton, his wife and a producer of the film, “debated whether it was a gamble worth taking with Diego,” Chazelle said. “She had this full 100% unwavering belief in him.”
Several months into the casting process, Calva began to feel overwhelmed by the life-changing magnitude of the opportunity, which seemed closer to materializing but not yet certain. Aside from executing Chazelle’s increasingly specific notes about his line delivery, improving his English became a priority.
In late 2020, Calva finally traveled to Los Angeles to meet with Chazelle and Robbie, who would play Nellie LaRoy, a fictional starlet and Manny’s love interest.
Using his cellphone, Chazelle filmed the chemistry read between Calva and Robbie in his backyard. Their palpable energy convinced him that Calva could deliver on his potential.
“He had this kind of Al Pacino-level ability to command the camera without seeming to do anything,” Chazelle said. In fact, Pacino’s arc from innocence to corruption as Michael Corleone in “The Godfather” films served as a key reference for Calva’s turn.
Robbie admired Calva’s ability to improvise in his second language.
“It’s so transformative to act with him because he’s so present that you forget you’re doing a scene,” Robbie said. “He was the greatest scene partner I could ever wish for.”
For Calva, the parallels between him and Manny feel almost like docu-fiction. “I identify with him in wanting to belong in the world of the movies,” he said. The actor’s wide-eyed reactions to an epic set piece early in the sweeping story came from genuine emotion.
“My first day on a Hollywood set was also the character’s first day on a Hollywood set,” Calva explained. “All of the expressions of surprise you see on my face are real.”
By the time one of the final scenes was shot, in which Manny watches the musical “Singin’ in the Rain” and cries, Calva had been immersed in the universe of Chazelle’s movie for nearly eight months. For that emotional moment, the director asked him to replay “Babylon” in its entirety, from Manny’s point of view, via facial expressions.
“It’s such a crazy piece of direction, and he does it,” Robbie said. “You feel everything you’ve felt for the last three hours play out on his face in a few seconds.”
“I needed an actor who could really dig deep and summon something,” Chazelle said. “It’s the hardest kind of acting to do because you don’t have the benefit of words, language or even body movement. You have to do it all just in your face, in your eyes.”
As Manny rises in Hollywood, he loses perspective, even denying his Mexican identity and claiming to be from Spain. Calva, grounded in advice from his mother, whom he considers his best friend, said he believed that wouldn’t happen to him.
“I don’t want to lose my childlike outlook on life, my ability for wonder,” Calva said. “I want to remember the road back home and know that if I make mistakes I won’t lose myself.”
For now, Calva plans to remain in Mexico City and build his burgeoning career, but whenever he’s wanted on this side of the border, the actor will joyfully oblige.
“They invited me to this party,” Calva said with a hint of mischievous glee. “Getting me out of Hollywood is going to be difficult.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: These shows take listeners deep into the stories and scandals behind the British throne.
Queen Elizabeth II's death in September ended the longest reign in Britain's history and began a seismic shift for the majority of Britons who have never known life under any other monarch. Her son Charles III, who will be crowned in the new year, has inherited a number of scandals, including the sexual-abuse allegations against Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his military titles and royal patronages in 2022; and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's self-imposed exile from royal life, which has been dramatically re-litigated in the couple's Netflix docuseries.
Whether you're a royal devotee just trying to kill time until Prince Harry's memoir is released in January or a curious newcomer to the world of Windsor, these five podcasts will provide context and commentary on the latest palace intrigue, fill in the gaps in your historical knowledge and offer some sense of what the monarchy's future may hold.
'Royally Obsessed'
As the pace and stakes of royal news have grown in recent years, the hosts of "Royally Obsessed" have been there every step of the way, offering affable and spirited insights. Introduced in 2018, a few months after the announcement of Harry and Meghan's engagement, the podcast focuses on the Cambridges and the Sussexes, and the increasingly clear rift between them. Early episodes now feel like a strangely poignant time capsule capturing a simpler time for royal fans, as Kaitlin Menza and Lisa Ryan chronicle the run-up to Harry and Meghan's wedding with infectious enthusiasm and discuss the historic significance of the addition of Meghan to the royal family. In March 2020, around the time the Sussexes said they would step back from royal duties, the current "Royally Obsessed" hosts, Roberta Fiorito and Rachel Bowie, took over the podcast and have been on hand ever since for weekly dissections of every rumour and carefully worded palace statement.
Starter episode: "Decoding the Docuseries"
'Noble Blood'
While the last few years of royal news have been a roller coaster by modern standards, they pale in comparison to the tales of betrayal and beheadings from centuries past. In this enormously entertaining scripted nonfiction show, Dana Schwartz delivers deep dives into how members of the nobility lived and died throughout history. Though many of the sagas covered here are familiar, like the execution of the Romanovs and the unfortunate fates of Henry VIII's wives, "Noble Blood" never delivers a rote version of their stories. For instance, listeners learn that Marie Antoinette's final words were an apology to her executioner, for accidentally stepping on his foot as she walked to the guillotine. But the most compelling episodes are often those that focus on obscure figures, like the fearsome Russian empress Anna Ioannovna, who constructed a palace out of ice, which she then used as a torture chamber.
Starter episode: "Ever Dearest Cousin Nicky"
'The HeirPod'
Omid Scobie has become one of the best known royal reporters ever since he, with Carolyn Durand, wrote "Finding Freedom," a best-selling biography of Harry and Meghan that hinted at behind-the-scenes drama that has since been openly discussed. In this ABC News series, Scobie offers an inside track on many of the monarchy's recent crises alongside Maggie Rulli, an ABC foreign correspondent, focusing on the diverging trajectories of Princes William and Harry. Though the podcast ended in the summer of 2021, it's well worth revisiting for anyone seeking insight into the rapidly shifting power dynamics of "the Firm," a term Harry and Meghan have used to refer to the British royal family.
Starter episode: "The impact of Harry and Meghan's Oprah interview"
'British History: Royals, Rebels and Romantics'
It's hard to fully understand the inner workings of an institution like the monarchy without a good handle on the centuries of history that have shaped it. Hosted by Carol Ann Lloyd, a writer and speaker whose expertise includes the Tudors, "British History" is a deeply researched treat for anyone who loves a good period drama. Some of her most unmissable episodes revolve around the 15th century Wars of the Roses, which inspired the "Game of Thrones" author George R.R. Martin. In addition to royal history, Lloyd often deviates into other aspects of medieval and Elizabethan England, including several Shakespeare-themed episodes and a mini-series on the history of witchcraft. While Lloyd generally limits her focus to the past, the show will occasionally dedicate an episode to current events when the moment calls for it; after the Queen's death, Lloyd released an episode in which she put the event in historical context as "the end of a second Elizabethan era."
Starter episode: "Elizabeth I: Woman & Queen with Prof. Susan Doran"
'Podcast Royal'
So many royal-news podcasts offer virtually the same content. What differentiates "Podcast Royal" is the way it capitalizes on the aspirational appeal of the monarchy, delivering royal-approved beauty, health and wellness tips that listeners can incorporate into their own civilian lives. Hosted by Jessica Robinson and Rachel Burchfield, an editor at Marie Claire, this podcast feels like an escapist glossy magazine in audio form, blending commentary on current events with features about the royals' residences and daily routines, along with longer explorations of how royal traditions have evolved over the years.
Starter episode: "25. Royal Weddings, Part 1: Dresses"
