Full text: These underappreciated plants attract a "hungry throng" of beneficial insects. They're not bad to look at, either.
To see a field of common milkweed in midsummer -- a sea of a thousand nodding pink flower heads -- you would not imagine that anything could ever stand in the way of the genus Asclepias.
Yes, common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), the most widespread milkweed east of the Rocky Mountains, can colonize disturbed sites and form impressive stands. But it is an exception among the more than 90 recognized North American species of milkweed, many of which often find it not so easy to continue making themselves at home.
"The milkweed is a displaced citizen in its own land," writes Eric Lee-Mäder in the opening of his new book, "The Milkweed Lands: An Epic Story of One Plant, Its Nature and Ecology." "Where once it owned the continent, it's now a kind of vagrant, occupying the botanical equivalent of homeless encampments."
As one example, he cites 2012 research, by John M. Pleasants of Iowa State University and Karen S. Oberhauser of the University of Minnesota, that estimates a nearly 60 percent decrease in the milkweed populations of the Midwest since 1999.
"Milkweeds, at least the North American ones, are like so many other meadow and grassland species," Mr. Lee-Mäder said in a recent conversation. "They're both dependent upon us and also subject to the various indignities of coexisting with us."
The beginnings of our agrarian legacy set much of their displacement in motion, when vast tracts of original prairie sod were plowed up to create croplands. Since the 1990s, the use of increasingly sophisticated chemical herbicides that kill everything but the crops genetically engineered to resist them has essentially "targeted milkweeds for elimination," he said.
Once, milkweed "would get shredded and pulverized by cultivation equipment, but it would spring back from the live rhizomes underground," he continued. Now, "the milkweed within those systems just dies."
We have relegated milkweed to ditches and abandoned lots, said Mr. Lee-Mäder, an ecologist at the invertebrate-focused Xerces Society, where he is the co-director of pollinator and agricultural biodiversity. He directs the nonprofit's private-sector initiatives, supporting pollinator-conservation work across thousands of acres with companies like General Mills, Nestlé and Danone, undertaking habitat restoration on farms that supply them with ingredients like almonds and blueberries.
Mr. Lee-Mäder and his wife, Mari Lee-Mäder, also operate Northwest Meadowscapes, in Port Townsend, Wash., a supplier of regional native seeds that also provides consultation services for meadow makers.
They know something that anyone who gives milkweed refuge will soon learn: If you welcome this plant, a diverse, living fan base will follow close behind -- and not only monarch butterflies.
If you plant it, they will come. Sometimes as if out of thin air.
A Two-Way Chemistry Equation
If someone says "milkweed," maybe you also hear "monarch butterfly" in your head. It's almost as if the two are inextricably linked.
Mention of this plant probably also brings to mind stories of its distinctive chemistry. Many plants defend themselves against herbivory by producing unpalatable or toxic chemicals, but "milkweeds take this strategy especially seriously," Mr. Lee-Mäder writes.
Asclepias produce potent steroids called cardenolides "that can disrupt the life functions of vertebrate animals unlucky enough to feed on them," he adds. (A bonus: These chemicals may also discourage deer.)
But while milkweeds have evolved their chemical defenses to protect themselves, they may also "be gifting these chemical defenses to some of the animals that live in association with them," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, "as much as using these to check and control the amount of herbivory that they have to sustain."
One notable example: monarchs, which have famously evolved to ingest milkweeds without harm. Their larvae rely on Asclepias as an obligate host plant, or a food required for at least one stage of development. Eating it fosters an anti-predation chemical defense of their own.
So critical is this relationship that female monarchs lay their eggs on milkweed leaves, ensuring that the needed sustenance is at hand when offspring emerge.
"They use their olfactory sense to identify the locations of milkweeds on wind currents," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, "tracking those down like bloodhounds on a trail, to be able to lay their eggs on those plants."
The monarch-milkweed connection is often spoken of as "chemical warfare," but Mr. Lee-Mäder prefers to think of it as a "two-way relationship" or "a partnership."
The monarchs' part: Although the adult butterflies are not great pollinators, they do visit milkweed flowers for nectar, potentially moving some pollinia (milkweeds' pollen-bearing structures) long distances during their migrations.
"That gene flow that monarchs may facilitate is probably unmatched by other flower visitors to milkweeds," Mr. Lee-Mäder said.
Not Just Monarchs
As intimate and celebrated as the plants' relationship with monarchs is, the community surrounding milkweeds is far more diverse.
"The hungry throng" that Mr. Lee-Mäder enumerates includes at least 40 insect species that "feed often or exclusively on North American milkweeds in the summer," he writes. They include butterflies, moths, beetles and aphids.
In a milkweed seed-farm field in the Midwest, he recalls witnessing a cloud of aphids descend on the breeze, as if tuned in by GPS to the emerging crops' location. "It's like seeing nature sort of manifest itself out of thin air around this plant," he said.
Before you say, "No, not aphids; not in my garden," think about their role in the big picture, Mr. Lee-Mäder said -- as food for beneficial insects like lady beetles and lacewing insects, for instance, which are, in turn, food for birds. And one of the most abundant milkweed-visiting aphids, the nonnative oleander aphid, is host-specific, meaning it doesn't eat other plants.
Other invertebrates, including slugs, snails and spider mites, may feast on milkweeds, too, as do some larger animals, like rabbits and ground squirrels, which are apparently resistant to poisoning.
Beyond so many opportunities for herbivory, Asclepias flowers provide nectar to adult butterflies and moths, along with an astonishing lineup of bee species and wasps.
And just look at them: Milkweeds are "among the most elaborate in the plant kingdom," he writes, with "a complexity comparable to that of rare orchids."
Which Ones to Grow?
It's easy to take delight in a stand of common milkweed or its Western counterpart, showy milkweed (A. speciosa) -- whether in bloom or later, holding their substantial seed-filled pods, or follicles. Lanky as these three- or four-footers may be, they put you "face to face with the wildness of what this genus can represent," Mr. Lee-Mäder said.
He expresses awe for rush milkweed (A. subulata), a three- to five-foot plant with whitish-green blooms that grows alongside the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) in nearly rainless parts of the desert Southwest. "It's a plant made up of stems -- it produces almost no leaves," he said, explaining its adaptation for survival.
There are other choices for gardens without a meadow-size space to offer, though, or those that aren't in the most arid places.
It's no surprise that butterfly weed (A. tuberosa), with its vivid orange flowers, has received the most horticultural attention.
"It's beautiful, it's compact, it's charismatic," Mr. Lee-Mäder said, noting also that orange is fairly uncommon among prairie and meadow flowers. Although the palette of Asclepias is generally quite different from East to West, "tuberosa is one that crosses the Continental Divide," he said, residing even in parts of the desert Southwest.
At just about two and a half feet high, a mature plant can produce "strikingly abundant blooms for the space that it takes up, and attract a really remarkable spectrum of flower visitors," he added. It is also pretty well adapted to the often highly altered soils of our human landscapes.
As its common name implies, swamp milkweed (A. incarnata), with its distinctive magenta flowers on stems of up to about four feet, can handle it wet. With rain gardens and bioswales increasingly being planted to manage more insistent runoff in a changing climate, this widespread species should get more play. Do you have a spot for it just beneath a downspout, or maybe at a pond's edge?
Another important but underappreciated species that Mr. Lee-Mäder wants to put in a word for, especially with Western gardeners, is the lavender-and-white-flowered narrowleaf milkweed (A. fascicularis), "one of the most widespread breeding plants for Western monarchs," he said.
Unlike Eastern butterfly populations, which overwinter in Mexico, Western monarchs spend the winter in coastal California and then move inland around March for breeding season. Their clusters break up and typically move straight eastward, into the Central Valley or Sierra Nevada foothills, fanning out from there.
"A monarch that wintered in Monterey might end up in Las Vegas or Boise or Spokane that next spring and summer," he said. They need more narrowleaf milkweed along their routes.
Like so many native plants, milkweeds may have persisted only on the fringes in nature, but gardeners can offer them prominent spots. A good place to begin researching which ones to choose is the Xerces Society's Project Milkweed and its region-specific plant lists.
"Planting milkweeds in a garden may be a small dent -- but it's a dent," Mr. Lee-Mäder said. "If everybody does it, it will add a different kind of richness to our landscapes."

David Gilmour, 91, an Entrepreneur Who Put Fiji Water in Square Bottles: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An entrepreneur for more than 50 years, he built a luxurious club in Fiji and started a bottled water company, now the second-largest imported water brand in the United States.
David Gilmour, a Canadian-born entrepreneur who in the 1990s built a luxury resort on Wakaya, a tiny island he owned in Fiji, and then created Fiji Natural Artesian Water, turning a local resource into a leading bottled brand, died on June 11 in Manhattan. He was 91.
The cause was cardiac arrest, said David Roth, a friend and business partner.
By the time he bought Wakaya from two business partners in 1987, Mr. Gilmour had built several businesses over 30 years. He imported Scandinavian home furnishings and built high-end stereos. He helped assemble a chain of hotels in the South Pacific, which made him familiar with the archipelago nation of Fiji, and he co-founded a gold-mining company.
But there was something different about Wakaya. At the time, he was mourning the death of his only child, Erin Gilmour, who had been murdered in her apartment in Toronto in 1983.
He called the island "the last bastion of sanity in the world," his wife, Jillian (Sweeney) Gilmour, said in a phone interview. "He thought when everything went kerflooey, this is where he would go.
"The island itself is so beautiful," she continued. "There's an area called Chieftain's Leap, with soaring cliffs, where peregrine falcons make their nests."
In 1990, Mr. Gilmour opened the Wakaya Club & Spa, a cluster of eight free-standing suites on a former coconut plantation. At the time, he said, he opened it as "really just a place where my friends, those I can't put up in my own home, can come and share the peace." He added: "I don't see it as terribly commercial, frankly. It will probably only break even."
It nonetheless became popular with celebrities, including Tom Cruise, Bill and Melinda Gates (who spent part of their honeymoon there) and Keith Richards, who fell out of a palm tree there in 2006 and was flown to a hospital in New Zealand with a head injury.
One day in the 1990s, Mr. Gilmour saw guests at the property drinking Evian water.
"He said, 'There's something wrong with this picture,' and I said, "What do you mean?"' Ms. Gilmour said. "And he said, 'We're on our own island, and they're drinking water from Lake Geneva. I know that with Fiji's rainfall, there must be a greater water source."'
Mr. Gilmour learned of an underground aquifer beneath the volcanic highlands of the Fijian island of Viti Levu, with water rich in the mineral silica. In 1996, his company began packaging and shipping its distinctive square bottles around the world.
Mr. Gilmour said the water's purity was the result of Fiji's geographic remoteness. "There's no acid rain, no industrial pollution, no pesticides," he told The Palm Beach Post of Florida in 1998. "It's the purest virgin ecosystem."
Fiji is now the second-largest imported water brand in the United States (after San Pellegrino), according to the Beverage Marketing Corporation.
David Harrison Gilmour was born on Nov. 5, 1931, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and grew up in Toronto. His father, Adam Gilmour, was an investment banker, and his mother, Doris Godson Gilmour, was an opera singer.
Mr. Gilmour studied business management for a year at the University of Toronto. He then accepted his father's offer of a $ 10-a-day stipend to travel through Europe, which he did for a while before returning to Canada.
"I learned what people are really like," he told Palm Beach Illustrated in 2015. "I learned to touch only what I totally believe in 100 percent. And I learned how to take care of myself."
He turned down his father's offer to join his bank and instead moved to Montreal, where he sold pots and pans door to door for a year.
His first business was importing modern, streamlined Scandinavian housewares and furnishings. He followed that in 1958 with the start-up Clairtone Sound, a collaboration with Peter Munk, a Hungarian-born electrical engineer. The company made critically acclaimed, sophisticated hi-fi systems whose buyers included Frank Sinatra and Hugh Hefner. But it foundered after branching into televisions and shifting operations, disastrously, to Nova Scotia.
Amid steep losses, Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Munk were forced out of the company in 1968 and later settled a lawsuit claiming that they sold shares before the announcement of poor quarterly results in 1967.
They recovered quickly and in 1969 started Southern Pacific Properties, which accumulated more than 50 hotels in Australia and New Zealand as well as in Fiji, New Caledonia, Tahiti and other islands. An ambitious development that was to be built near the pyramids in Giza, Egypt, was eventually nixed by President Anwar Sadat in 1978.
Three years later, Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat, a Singaporean banker, purchased Southern Pacific for a reported $ 130 million. But Wakaya remained separately owned by Mr. Gilmour and his partners, until Mr. Gilmour bought them out.
In the early 1980s, Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Munk were among the original partners in Barrick Gold, one of the world's largest gold producers. Mr. Munk was its longtime chairman and chief executive, and Mr. Gilmour was a board member until 2001. Mr. Munk died in 2018.
Mr. Gilmour described his working relationship with Mr. Munk in 2008 with The Globe and Mail of Toronto. "I am more the entrepreneurial type who likes challenges of starting up, and Peter loves growing a colossus," he said. "Once it reaches a critical mass, I kind of get bored sitting around a boardroom table."
Fiji Water, marketed as a luxury brand, was a major commercial success. But, like other brands, it drew scorn from environmentalists, who criticized the industry for the amount of energy it consumed and the greenhouse gases created in making and shipping plastic bottles, and for the plastic waste they leave behind. Fiji, in particular, was singled out for shipping water to consumers thousands of miles away.
Mr. Gilmour sold Fiji Water to Roll International in 2004, and Wakaya to Clare Bronfman, an heir to the Seagram's liquor fortune, in 2016, after a Category 5 cyclone devastated the island. "We sold it for 10 cents on the dollar," Ms. Gilmour said. In 2020, Ms. Bronfman was sentenced to prison for her role in enabling the Nxivm sex cult.
Mr. Gilmour's wife is his only immediate survivor. His marriages to Anna Wilmot, Erin's mother, and to Diane Williams ended in divorce. He lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.
Mr. Gilmour, who sold his Palm Beach estate last year for $ 44.9 million, had one last company in his portfolio at his death: Wakaya Perfection, a wellness company that sells powders and capsules of ginger and turmeric grown in volcanic soil in Fiji and Nicaragua.
"David had this belief that organic, single-source, very pure, high-quality ginger and turmeric would be something that people wanted," Mr. Roth, who started the company with Mr. Gilmour, said by phone. "And Oprah chose it twice as one of her favorite things."

Seaweed Is Hot. Can It Thrive as Planet Warms?: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For centuries, it's been treasured in kitchens in Asia and neglected almost everywhere else: Those glistening ribbons of seaweed that bend and bloom in cold ocean waves.
Today, seaweed is suddenly a hot global commodity. It's attracting new money and new purpose in all kinds of new places because of its potential to help tame some of the hazards of the modern age, not least climate change.
In London, a start-up is making a plastic substitute out of seaweed. In Australia and Hawaii, others are racing to grow seaweed that, when fed to livestock, can cut methane from cow burps. Researchers are studying just how much carbon dioxide can be sequestered by seaweed farms, as investors eye them as a new source of carbon credits for polluters to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.
And in South Korea, one of the most established seaweed growing countries in the world, farmers are struggling to keep up with growing export demand.
But even as its champions see it as a miracle crop for a hotter planet, others worry that the zeal to farm the ocean could replicate some of the same damages of farming on land. Much is unknown about how seaweed farms, particularly those far offshore, can affect marine ecosystems.
"Seaweed protagonists believe seaweed is a cure to everything, that seaweed is a magical panacea for climate problems," said David Koweek, chief scientist for Ocean Visions, a consortium of research organizations studying ocean-based interventions for the climate crisis. "Seaweed antagonists think seaweed is completely overhyped."
There's another problem. Seaweed is itself feeling the impact of climate change, particularly in Asia.
"The water is way too hot," said Sung-kil Shin, a third-generation seaweed farmer, as he pulled his boat into harbor one morning on Soando Island, just south of the South Korean mainland, where seaweed has long been foraged and farmed.
'Plastic' from seaweed
Pierre Paslier once made a living by designing plastic packages for cosmetics. It felt to him like "leasing out my brain to a big plastic polluter."
He wanted out. He wanted to create packaging that would come from nature and disappear into nature, quickly. With a friend from graduate school, Rodrigo García González, he created a company called NotPla, short for "not plastic."
From an East London warehouse, they designed an edible sachet of water, made of seaweed and other plant extracts: To drink the water you simply pop the sachet in your mouth. They designed another one that can hold ketchup and a third for cosmetics.
They also began making a seaweed-based coating for takeout cardboard boxes. Just Eat, a food delivery app in Britain, began using it for some of its orders, including at the European women's soccer finals in July at Wembley Stadium.
It's still niche. The seaweed coating, designed for home composting bins, is considerably more expensive than the plastic coating now used on most takeout boxes made of paper.
But Mr. Paslier is looking to the future. The European Union has a new law restricting single-use plastic. A global plastics treaty is under negotiation.
"Seaweed is not going to replace all plastic, but seaweed combined with other things can tackle single use plastic," he said. "We are barely scratching the surface."
Foragers from the past
In the gray light of dawn, Soon-ok Goh, a slight 71-year-old, swam soundlessly in the shallow waters of Gijang, on the southern coast of South Korea. Her feet were sheathed in yellow flippers, her thin, small frame in a wetsuit. She surfaced above water for a few seconds, took a long breath that sounded almost like a whistle in the quiet of the morning, then dived down again, yellow flippers upturned.
Ms. Goh is among the last practitioners of a vanishing trade. Since the end of the 7th century, women like her have foraged for wild seaweed, along with other seafood, in the chilly waters around the Korean Peninsula.
This morning, a tiny pink-handled knife in hand, she snipped shiny green-brown ribbons of kelp called miyeok. She plucked sea snails clinging to rocks, two kinds of sea cucumbers, a handful of kelp-devouring sea urchins.
All went into her sack.
What role seaweed plays in your life depends on where you're from.
For Alaska's Indigenous people, seaweed has been a source of sustenance for generations. The Irish and Welsh have used it to make pudding. Japanese soup stock is made of kelp. Seaweed extracts also help millions of people worldwide keep their teeth clean; it's been used to make toothpaste for years.
In Korea, bordered by water on three sides, 20 different species of seaweed have been recorded. It is central to cuisine and culture.
After childbirth, mothers are served a soup made of miyeok, iron-rich and brown, and children are served it on their birthdays to honor mothers. Dried, salted sheets of gim are eaten as snacks or dusted over cookies. Wispy tendrils of maesaengi are tucked into a steamy breakfast porridge that's believed to be a hangover cure.
In decades past, when there was no money to buy rice, you could go to the sea and find seaweed, said Hye Kyung Jeong, a food historian at Hoseo University in Seoul. "Seaweed helped people survive during famines," she said.
This is not the first time seaweed has helped avert a crisis.
Slimy arms race
The new frontier for seaweed production lies beyond Asia.
Steve Meller, an American businessman in Australia, grows seaweed in giant glass tanks on land. Specifically, a red seaweed native to the waters around Australia called asparagopsis, which beef and dairy companies are eyeing as a way to meet their climate goals.
A sprinkle of asparagopsis in cattle feed can cut methane from their burps by between 82 and 98 percent, according to several independent studies.
"The race is on, I suppose, to get the world's first commercial supply," Mr. Meller said. "The demand is off-the-roof scale."
Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy producer, has begun commercial trials of the seaweed supplement, and Ben and Jerry's is planning its own trials soon. The global dairy giant Danone has invested in an asparagopsis start-up.
Whether seaweed can make a dent in cattle methane remains unclear. In the United States, there's another hurdle to overcome: regulatory approval.
Nevertheless, it could be key to the beef and dairy industry's ability to meet climate goals. Emissions from food systems alone, mainly meat and dairy, could raise the global average temperature by 1 degree Celsius by the end of the century, blowing past the threshold of relatively safe global warming, researchers have said.
Climate pressures
Seabirds dive and squawk around the fishing port in Soando, an island off the southern tip of South Korea, as Mr. Shin's boat pulls in with the morning's harvest.
Mr. Shin, 44, has plied these waters for 20 years and has seen climate change upend his trade. He grows a red kelp species called pyropia, which favors cold water during its growing season. So he has been going further and further from shore in search of chilly waves.
By mid-April, Mr. Shin says, the water isn't as cold as Pyropia likes. His yield has suffered. "People want more seaweed these days," he said. "But there's no more seaweed."
Since 1968, the waters where Mr. Shin farms have warmed by 1.4 degrees Celsius, slightly higher than the global average. That's why South Korean scientists are racing to breed strains that can thrive in warmer waters.
Seaweed farms are a far cry from the rows of corn and wheat that make up monoculture farming on land. But even as they signify new opportunities, they present ecological risks, many of them unknown.
They could block sunlight to creatures who need it below. They could scatter plastic buoys in the sea, which already suffers from too much plastic. They could leave their plant detritus on the seafloor, altering the marine ecosystem.
"It needs to be carried out with a great deal of care," said Scott Pillias, a doctoral student in economics who studies marine systems at the University of Queensland. "We shouldn't expect seaweed to save us."

For centuries, it’s been treasured in kitchens in Asia and neglected almost everywhere else: those glistening ribbons of seaweed that bend and bloom in cold ocean waves.
Today, seaweed is suddenly a hot global commodity. It’s attracting new money and new purpose in all kinds of new places because of its potential to help tame some of the hazards of the modern age, not least climate change.
In London, a startup is making a plastic substitute out of seaweed. In Australia and Hawaii, others are racing to grow seaweed that, when fed to livestock, can cut methane from cow burps. Researchers are studying just how much carbon dioxide can be sequestered by seaweed farms as investors eye them as a new source of carbon credits for polluters to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.
And in South Korea, one of the most established seaweed-growing countries in the world, farmers are struggling to keep up with growing export demand.
What was mainly a relatively small Asian industry is now coveted by the West. Far beyond South Korea, new farms have cropped up in Maine, the Faeroe Islands, Australia, even the North Sea. Globally, seaweed production has grown by nearly 75% in the past decade. The focus is moving far beyond its traditional use in cuisine.
But even as its champions see it as a miracle crop for a hotter planet, others worry that the zeal to farm the ocean could replicate some of the same damages of farming on land. Much is unknown about how seaweed farms, particularly those far offshore, can affect marine ecosystems.
“Seaweed protagonists believe seaweed is a cure to everything, that seaweed is a magical panacea for climate problems,” said David Koweek, chief scientist for Ocean Visions, a consortium of research organizations studying ocean-based interventions for the climate crisis. “Seaweed antagonists think seaweed is completely overhyped.”
There’s another problem. Seaweed is itself feeling the impact of climate change, particularly in Asia.
“The water is way too hot,” said Sung-kil Shin, a third-generation seaweed farmer, as he pulled his boat into harbor one morning on Soando Island, just south of the South Korean mainland, where seaweed has long been foraged and farmed.
‘Plastic’ From Seaweed
Pierre Paslier once made a living by designing plastic packages for cosmetics. It felt to him like “leasing out my brain to a big plastic polluter.”
He wanted out. He wanted to create packaging that would come from nature and disappear into nature, quickly. With a friend from graduate school, Rodrigo García González, he created a company called NotPla, short for “not plastic.”
From an East London warehouse, they designed an edible sachet of water, made of seaweed and other plant extracts: To drink the water, you simply pop the sachet in your mouth. They designed another one that can hold ketchup and a third for cosmetics.
They also began making a seaweed-based coating for takeout cardboard boxes. Just Eat, a food delivery app in Britain, began using it for some of its orders, including at the European women’s soccer finals in July at Wembley Stadium.
It’s still niche. The seaweed coating, designed for home composting bins, is considerably more expensive than the plastic coating now used on most takeout boxes made of paper.
But Paslier is looking to the future. The European Union has a new law restricting single-use plastic. A global plastics treaty is under negotiation.
“Seaweed is not going to replace all plastic, but seaweed combined with other things can tackle single-use plastic,” he said. “We are barely scratching the surface.”
Foragers From the Past
In the gray light of dawn, Soon-ok Goh, a slight 71-year-old, swam soundlessly in the shallow waters of Gijang, on the southern coast of South Korea. Her feet were sheathed in yellow flippers, her thin, small frame in a wet suit. She surfaced above water for a few seconds, took a long breath that sounded almost like a whistle in the quiet of the morning, then dived down again, yellow flippers upturned.
Goh is among the last practitioners of a vanishing trade. Since the end of the seventh century, women like her have foraged for wild seaweed, along with other seafood, in the chilly waters around the Korean Peninsula.
This morning, a tiny pink-handled knife in hand, she snipped shiny green-brown ribbons of kelp called miyeok. She plucked sea snails clinging to rocks, two kinds of sea cucumbers, a handful of kelp-devouring sea urchins.
All went into her sack.
Her grandmother taught her the trade, Goh said, which is known as haenyeo, or the “sea women.” She has been diving since she was 9 years old. “People who do this kind of work are disappearing,” she said. “When I’m done, no one will do it.” With demand rising, old practices are getting pushed into the past.
What role seaweed plays in your life depends on where you’re from.
For Alaska’s Indigenous people, seaweed has been a source of sustenance for generations. The Irish and Welsh have used it to make pudding. Japanese soup stock is made of kelp. Seaweed extracts also help millions of people worldwide keep their teeth clean; it’s been used to make toothpaste for years.
In Korea, bordered by water on three sides, 20 species of seaweed have been recorded. It is central to cuisine and culture.
After childbirth, mothers are served a soup made of miyeok, iron-rich and brown, and children are served it on their birthdays to honor mothers. Dried, salted sheets of gim are eaten as snacks or dusted over cookies. Wispy tendrils of maesaengi are tucked into a steamy breakfast porridge that’s believed to be a hangover cure.
In decades past, when there was no money to buy rice, you could go to the sea and find seaweed, said Hye Kyung Jeong, a food historian at Hoseo University in Seoul, South Korea. “Seaweed helped people survive during famines,” she said.
This is not the first time seaweed has helped avert a crisis.
Slimy Arms Race
The new frontier for seaweed production lies beyond Asia.
Steve Meller, an American businessperson in Australia, grows seaweed in giant glass tanks on land — specifically, a red seaweed native to the waters around Australia called asparagopsis, which beef and dairy companies are eyeing as a way to meet their climate goals.
A sprinkle of asparagopsis in cattle feed can cut methane from their burps by between 82% and 98%, according to several independent studies. Cattle burps are a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
“The race is on, I suppose, to get the world’s first commercial supply,” Meller said. “The demand is off-the-roof scale.”
His company, named CH4, after methane’s chemical formula, is competing to bring asparagopsis to the mouths of cows. At least two other Australian startups, Sea Forest and Rumin8, are in the seaweed-for-cattle race. So are Symbrosia and Blue Ocean Barns, both in Hawaii.
Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy producer, has begun commercial trials of the seaweed supplement, and Ben & Jerry’s is planning its own trials soon. The global dairy giant Danone has invested in an asparagopsis startup.
Whether seaweed can make a dent in cattle methane remains unclear. In the United States, there’s another hurdle to overcome: regulatory approval.
Nevertheless, it could be key to the beef and dairy industry’s ability to meet climate goals. Emissions from food systems alone, mainly meat and dairy, could raise the global average temperature by 1 degree Celsius by the end of the century, blowing past the threshold of relatively safe global warming, researchers have said.
Climate Pressures
Seabirds dive and squawk around the fishing port in Soando, an island off the southern tip of South Korea, as Shin’s boat pulls in with the morning’s harvest.
Shin, 44, has plied these waters for 20 years and has seen climate change upend his trade. He grows a red kelp species called pyropia, which favors cold water during its growing season. So he has been going further and further from shore in search of chilly waves.
By mid-April, Shin said, the water isn’t as cold as pyropia likes. His yield has suffered. “People want more seaweed these days,” he said. “But there’s no more seaweed.”
Since 1968, the waters where Shin farms have warmed by 1.4 degrees Celsius, slightly higher than the global average. That’s why South Korean scientists are racing to breed strains that can thrive in warmer waters.
Seaweed farms are a far cry from the rows of corn and wheat that make up monoculture farming on land. But even as they signify new opportunities, they present ecological risks, many of them unknown.
They could block sunlight to creatures who need it below. They could scatter plastic buoys in the sea, which already suffers from too much plastic. They could leave their plant detritus on the seafloor, altering the marine ecosystem.
“It needs to be carried out with a great deal of care,” said Scott Pillias, a doctoral student in economics who studies marine systems at the University of Queensland. “We shouldn’t expect seaweed to save us.”

Full text: WHO DOES THAT BITCH THINK SHE IS? Doris Fish and the Rise of Drag, by Craig Seligman
From wee-hours cabaret to prime-time reality TV to fiercely contended children's story hour at the local library, the American drag queen's journey has been a long and bumpy one.
For Doris Fish, alter ego of Philip Clargo Mills, it began not in America but Manly Vale, an apt-sounding suburb of Sydney, Australia, and ended in AIDS-ravaged San Francisco, 1991 -- with resurrection, one source maintains, as a ghost composed variously of golden sparks and Evian water.
I had not known of Fish before reading the journalist Craig Seligman's minutely observed new biography of him (though some friends used the female pronoun, "he never wanted to be a woman -- he never even wanted to seem like a woman," the author writes). I finished it persuaded this was a life well worth examining, if only because his peers are so often celebrated, or excoriated, in aggregate.
Most of Fish's performances are unrecoverable, but those that can be scratched up are indelible. Best known, in a limited way, is probably "Vegas in Space," a posthumously released and deeply weird 1991 sci-fi comedy about male earthlings who undergo sex-change operations so they can travel to a female-only planet (something about recovering stolen jewels...).
Promoting the movie during its production period on a Pittsburgh morning show in 1986, Fish gamely endures being treated like a talking zoo animal by the gawking hosts and awkwardly grinning housewives. There's also a choppy video out there of his swan song, "This Is My Life," fervidly performed in a caftan and satin gloves at the benefit from which the book takes its name. He was months from death.
Born in 1952, Philip was a middle child of six in a tolerant Catholic family that permitted a marijuana plant on the premises. He played a high-kicking chorus girl under a priest's tutelage at his all-boy school's year-end musical with more enthusiasm than most of his classmates. Remarkably indifferent to the prospect of arrest or social censure, he joined a local troupe called Sylvia and the Synthetics whose outré antics had me scrawling exclamation points in the margins.
One female impersonator's considerable male member was tucked through his legs to simulate a tail. Another pinned back her hair with swastikas. Another bit into a dripping sheep's heart to punctuate a lovelorn ballad, blood dripping onto her ball gown like one of the less tasteful Valentine's Day bitmojis. There were flash mobs of Marilyn Monroe impersonators and teetering pyramids of performers on quaaludes. "Everything was permitted," Seligman writes dryly, "including ineptitude."
After working for the Florence Broadhurst wallpaper factory, from which he filched metallic powders for his cosmetics, Philip/Doris moved to San Francisco, money sewn into his pockets by his loving mother, Mildred, and found his true calling. Mostly this was what was then called prostitution, though in Fish's hands it seems more like a kind of sexual nursing. He specialized in relations with those society often rejected, the obese or infirm. (There was a green-card marriage to a lesbian, one of the few survivors of his circle who declined to be interviewed here.)
He acted as "comedy model" for a greeting-card company called West Graphic, portraits that Seligman compares to the work of Cindy Sherman. He wrote a popular column for The San Francisco Sentinel, then an essential gay weekly. And he performed in a group called Sluts a-Go-Go, emulating faded stars of the '30s and '40s while occasionally brushing up against rising ones (Robin Williams, Lynda Carter). The Sluts and their associates were equal-opportunity offenders, doing racial as well as gender impressions, spewing double entendre and sometimes seeming to positively assault their audiences with sensory overload, exaggerated glamour and flagrant disregard for safety codes.
Though revolutionary in his in-your-faceness, Fish was not particularly political; the sincerity such activity requires was anathema. One of the more intriguing aspects of his foreshortened life was an attitude described here as Romantic Cruelism: a pose of complete indifference or dark humor even in the face of tragedy.
Fish displays it when his parents divorce; when a younger sister dies after a mysterious illness; and when one Synthetic, who had been a childhood friend, perishes in a fire: "Burnt to a cinder in a room full of exotic drag. All they found was a tooth," as Spurt!, a local punk zine, callously memorialized. "The young don't know what to do with endings," Seligman writes, and there were so many more to come.
"Who Does That Bitch Think She Is?" revisits and draws from a 1986 profile of Fish that Seligman wrote for skittish editors at Image magazine, a weekend section of The San Francisco Examiner. Aside from overuse of the words "notoriety" and "notorious," it is confidently written, wistful and quite personal; Seligman's now-husband, Silvana Nova, was part of Fish's scene.
The author of a previous book comparing Pauline Kael and Susan Sontag, Seligman diverts here and there to Sontag's "Notes on 'Camp,"' but spends most of his time simply retracing Fish's footsteps. At times these seem akin to the old Hans Christian Andersen version of "The Little Mermaid," whose heroine is granted the power to walk out of the water, but only with the pain of swords going through her. (In one parade, Fish's elaborate costume included fiberglass "legs" that drew blood from his own, covering the stains with black tights.)
Seligman's own stance is mostly one of wary wonderment, that drag queens have gone from "totally beyond the pale" to mainstream acknowledgment, "from feared freak into object of fascination," from the shaky spotlight to -- however contentiously -- the kindergarten rug. He piles a lot of historical weight on Fish's shoulders, but his subject carries it like Joan Crawford in a padded Adrian frock.

Danone Sued Over Its Plastic Use Under a Landmark Law: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Environmental groups are relying on a law in France requiring large companies to address their environmental footprint.
PARIS -- Danone, the French dairy giant, is being taken to court by three environmental groups who say it has failed to reduce its plastic footprint sufficiently, in a lawsuit challenging corporate social responsibility in the face of the climate crisis.
The groups accuse Danone -- one of the world's top 10 plastic polluters, according to a recent study -- of "failing to live up to its duties" under a groundbreaking French law that requires large companies to address their environmental impact and has opened ways to sue them should they fail to do so.
"Danone is trudging ahead without a serious plan to deal with plastics, despite clear concern from climate and health experts and consumers, and a legal obligation to face up to the issue," Rosa Pritchard, a lawyer for ClientEarth, one of the groups, said in a statement on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Danone said the company "strongly" refutes the accusation, adding that it was taking action to "reduce the use of plastic, develop reuse, reinforce collection and recycling channels, and develop alternative materials."
The lawsuit is likely to put the spotlight on the explosive growth of plastics pollution, which scientists say is affecting air and water quality, global warming, as well as human and animal life. The issue is so pressing that the United Nations last year agreed to begin writing a treaty designed to curb plastics production.
But Monday's announcement also spoke to a broader trend in environmental activism, with advocacy groups increasingly suing governments and companies in an effort to bridge the gap between their climate promises and their actual record.
Adam Weiss, ClientEarth program director for Europe, said some could see France's statute as toothless because of its vague requirements.
But, he added, "the teeth are in the lawsuits."
By suing Danone, ClientEarth and the two other groups, Surfrider Europe and Zero Waste France, are hoping to shed light on what many scientists say is a global plastic crisis whose potentially devastating effects have yet to be fully understood.
Throughout their life cycle, plastics, which are manufactured from fossil fuels, release air pollutants, harm human health and kill marine life. In 2015, they were responsible for 4.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, one recent study found, more than all of the world's airplanes combined.
Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that, over the past seven decades, plastics production has soared from two million metric tons (there are about 2,200 pounds per metric ton) to more than 400 million -- and is expected to almost triple by 2060.
Danone alone used more than 750,000 metric tons of plastic -- about 74 times the weight of the Eiffel Tower -- in water bottles , yogurt containers and other packaging in 2021, according to its 2021 financial report.
The company said that it reduced its plastic consumption by 12 percent from 2018 to 2021, and that it has committed to use only reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025. But Danone is not on track to reach that target, according to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which set up a voluntary program with the United Nations for big companies to address plastic pollution.
An investigation last year by the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle also highlighted Danone's shortcomings when it comes to recycled plastics.
Environmental groups also say that recycling has not proved effective at the scale necessary: Only 9 percent of all plastics ever made have been recycled, according to the United Nations, with most of the rest ending up in landfills and dumps.
"We're not going to recycle our way out of this," Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said.
He added that plastics were too critical to Danone's business model for "voluntary mechanisms" to be effective. "We need the power of law," he said.
To sue Danone, the environmental groups have relied on the so-called duty of vigilance law, a groundbreaking piece of legislation that France passed in 2017. It requires large companies to take effective measures to identify and prevent human rights violations and environmental damages throughout their chain of activity.
Impetus for the law came from the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, in which the collapse of a clothing factory killed more than 1,100 people in Bangladesh. Labels from famous brands were found in the rubble, casting a harsh light on the garment industry and prompting politicians and rights groups around the world to press for more corporate responsibility.
The French duty of vigilance law, the first of its kind in Europe, has since inspired similar legislation in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as a proposed European Union directive.
There is nothing like a duty of vigilance law in the United States. The Break Free From Plastic Pollution Act, which would require plastic producers to finance waste and recycling programs, and ban single-use plastic bags and the exporting of plastic waste to developing countries, is currently in committee.
However, environmental organizations have increasingly sued big plastic polluters like Coca-Cola over the past few years using mostly state-level consumer protection laws, alleging that the companies' use of single-use plastic contradicts advertising statements that they are committed to recycling and the environment.
In France, academics and rights groups say, many companies have responded to the law only by listing vague measures or some that already existed before the new obligations.
"It's often about streamlining existing practices," said Pauline Barraud de Lagerie, a sociologist at University Paris Dauphine who published a book on corporate responsibility. She added that by suing companies, "N.G.O.s are trying to somehow bring back an obligation of result."
So far, around 15 legal cases based on the French law have been reported. Half of them have gone to court and are still awaiting judgment, which could take years.
"We're making up for the government's lack of political will," said Sandra Cossart, the head of Sherpa, a group involved in four legal cases, pointing to what she described as a law lacking teeth.
The environmental groups said in their statement that Danone's 2021 vigilance plan "is completely silent on plastics." They are calling for judges in a Paris civil court to force the company to release a new plan within six months that would include a phaseout of plastics. Should the company fail to meet that deadline, they are demanding damages of 100,000 euros ( $ 108,000) per day of delay.
In September, the groups had issued formal notices to eight other major food companies accusing them of inadequate due diligence plans. ClientEarth said it had received satisfactory responses from companies such as the grocery chain Carrefour and Nestlé, which promised to step up their efforts, but not from Danone.
The lawsuit is part of a wider trend of climate litigation that has gained momentum in recent years, expanding the climate fight beyond traditional demonstrations and civil disobedience initiatives.
The number of climate change lawsuits globally has more than doubled from 2017 to 2022, from about 900 to more than 2,000 ongoing or concluded cases, according to data from the Grantham Research Institute and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.
Catherine Higham, a researcher at the Grantham institute, said that most cases have been brought against governments, but that increasingly advocacy groups have turned their sights on corporations.
Mr. Weiss of ClientEarth said his group had been struggling to navigate corporate laws "designed to protect investors and companies" in order to press them to better address environmental issues.
"Now, we have a law designed to make companies take action for the environment," he said. "That's a step change."
