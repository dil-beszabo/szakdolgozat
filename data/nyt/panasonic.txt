Full text: The company's woes are symptomatic of a wider malaise among companies that make batteries for electric vehicles.
The Swedish battery maker Northvolt, once seen as Europe's strongest competitor to Chinese battery manufacturers, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States on Thursday.
The company has been struggling financially for months, cutting jobs and restructuring operations. Founded in 2016 by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt said filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy would allow it to "restructure its debt, appropriately scale the business to current customer needs and secure a sustainable foundation for continued operation."
The company has faced a series of challenges this year. They began with accidents at a plant in Sweden and the loss of a contract with BMW worth 2 billion euros, or $ 2.15 billion, in June. In September, Northvolt announced plans to pause its production of cathode materials -- one of the basic building blocks of a battery -- at a factory in Skelleftea, Sweden.
Two planned factories in Germany and Canada are financed separately and will continue to operate outside the bankruptcy process, the company said. Northvolt's factories in Sweden will remain open and continue to make deliveries and pay vendors and employees, the company added.
The filing was made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, and the company said it expected to emerge from the process in the first quarter of next year.
"Despite near-term challenges, this action to strengthen our capital structure will allow us to capture the continued market demand for vehicle electrification," Tom Johnstone, the company's interim chairman, said in a statement.
Northvolt said it would gain access to new sources of funding through the bankruptcy process, including $ 145 million in cash. In addition, it said, one of its customers had committed to providing a $ 100 million loan.
The company reported a $ 1.2 billion loss in 2023, increasing from a $ 285 million loss in the previous year. Nevertheless, in January it secured financing from the European Union worth $ 5 billion, the largest loan from the bloc aimed at fostering green-tech industries.
Northvolt's woes are symptomatic of a wider malaise among companies that make batteries for electric vehicles, one that bodes ill for American and European automakers trying to keep pace with new rivals from China.
Chinese battery makers like CATL and BYD have been thriving while competitors in South Korea, Japan and Europe have been struggling. The Chinese battery makers are benefiting from soaring sales of electric vehicles in China, where the technology accounts for half of new car sales. That gives Chinese battery makers a clear advantage over competitors like Northvolt, SK, LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI and Panasonic, which are more dependent on Europe and the United States, where E.V. sales have been tepid.
Demand for battery-powered vehicles in Europe stagnated this year, growing only 1.3 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 14.6 percent in the previous year, according to the European Union.
The slump affecting battery makers underscores the extent to which China sets the tone for electric vehicle manufacturing. CATL is already the largest battery maker in the world by a wide margin.
Some people in the battery industry said it was a mistake to try to compete with Chinese manufacturers, given that they had a big head start. The Chinese government decided years ago to focus on electric vehicles and subsidized battery makers.
Investors and governments should have put their money into new battery technologies that would give them an advantage, said Celina Mikolajczak, a former Tesla executive who is the chief battery technology officer at Lyten, a Silicon Valley company that is developing batteries made using low-cost sulfur rather than costly metals like nickel and cobalt.
"If you are going to play in that industry, you have to bring something that differentiates you," Ms. Mikolajczak said.
Battery manufacturing is exceedingly difficult. Cells must be manufactured on automated assembly lines in dust-free environments using highly processed metals and chemicals. Minor impurities can ruin batches of cells, costing companies millions. Battery factories cost billions of dollars to build, and there is a shortage of engineers with the required know-how.
"The world grossly underestimated how hard it is to make batteries," said Gene Berdichevsky, the chief executive of Sila, a company that makes advanced battery materials. "We are going to shake out to fewer players."
Signs had been building that Northvolt was in distress. In August, the company said it would shut down a research and development center near San Francisco and consolidate the development of next-generation batteries in Sweden. Patrik Andreasson, the chief strategy officer at Northvolt, warned that Europe and the United States risked falling behind in electric vehicle technology.
"The longer we as Europe and North America take to switch over to full battery electric vehicles, the more territory we concede to competitors, mainly out of China," Mr. Andreasson said in an interview in August.

Charged Up Over Electric Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, said that the company had fixed battery-manufacturing problems and that its electric vehicles would soon be profitable.
Electric vehicles have had a hard year. Sales have been disappointing. Former President Donald J. Trump has regularly disparaged them. And even many environmentally conscious car buyers have been choosing hybrids instead.
Yet the chief executive of General Motors, Mary T. Barra, says the company is still committed to doing away with combustion engine cars in the United States by 2035 -- and she may have good reason for her optimism.
G.M. says it will start making money on battery-powered models by the end of the year -- becoming the only U.S. automaker aside from Tesla to achieve that feat. Sales of G.M.'s electric vehicles are starting to take off. And the company just introduced a model that sells for less than $ 30,000 after a federal tax credit.
G.M. and other manufacturers have delayed investment in electric vehicle projects. But in an interview, Ms. Barra rebuffed the notion that the transition from internal combustion has run out of juice. She said G.M. was determined to uphold its 2021 pledge to phase out sales of gasoline cars by 2035 in the United States.
"That is the plan we're still executing," she said.
Her expression of resolve comes at a critical moment. Without G.M., the largest U.S. carmaker, it is unlikely that the country can move away from internal combustion engines and the greenhouse gases they emit.
Tesla has largely driven the growth of electric vehicles. But lately the company's sales have slowed and its chief executive, Elon Musk, has sought to focus the company on long-shot plans to build autonomous taxis and humanoid robots while saying little about new consumer models.
Ms. Barra went to Spring Hill, Tenn., south of Nashville, this month to show that G.M. was serious about electric vehicles and to reassure investors that they could make money on them.
G.M. has retooled a plant in Spring Hill to produce electric Cadillacs and has built an enormous battery factory nearby. It has invested more than $ 4 billion as part of a plan to build electric vehicles in numbers that will drive down sticker prices while increasing profit margins.
The latest G.M. electric cars and trucks can travel more than 300 miles on a charge and one, the Chevrolet Equinox, lists at $ 35,000 before a $ 7,500 federal tax break.
In 2022, two years into the pandemic, new electric vehicles were quickly snapped up. That is no longer true but U.S. sales of such cars and trucks still grew about 11 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. Electric vehicles now account for 9 percent of the new car market, according to Kelley Blue Book, and some analysts expect them to hit 10 percent by the end of the year, up from 8 percent in 2023, as the Equinox and other affordable models reach showrooms.
G.M. did especially well during the third quarter, registering a 60 percent increase in electric vehicle sales largely because of new models like the Equinox and an electric Chevrolet Blazer. One in five Cadillacs sold in the United States from July through September was electric.
Tesla still sells five times as many electric vehicles as G.M. does. But given the early stage of this new technology, analysts said, Ms. Barra's main competition is Ford, Hyundai and other established automakers that are competing for the same customers as G.M.
"They don't have to beat Tesla," said Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who follows the auto industry. "They just have to beat everybody else."
Ms. Barra's personal commitment to electric vehicles was on display late last year when problems manufacturing a key battery component stalled production.
Earlier in her career, all of it spent at G.M., Ms. Barra oversaw all the company's production machinery. She drew on that expertise, spending "many days," she said, alongside engineers in a Detroit factory who were trying to fix an assembly line critical to battery manufacturing. Ms. Barra said she wanted to "understand the situation -- ask questions and then get them the support they needed."
Once that problem, which involved packaging battery cells into modules, was solved, G.M. swiftly increased production at battery factories in Spring Hill and in Warren, Ohio. Both those factories, and a third under construction in Lansing, Mich., are part of a joint venture with LG Energy Solution of South Korea. G.M. is planning a fourth battery factory, in New Carlisle, Ind., with Samsung, another Korean manufacturer.
G.M. has recruited several senior executives from Silicon Valley for technology expertise. In June the company hired David Richardson from Apple to lead software development, an area where most carmakers have struggled. Kurt Kelty, a former high-ranking executive at Tesla and Panasonic, a big battery supplier to Tesla, joined G.M. in February as vice president in charge of batteries.
G.M. has also locked in a steady domestic supply of lithium, a metal critical to batteries, by investing in a Nevada lithium mine called Thacker Pass.
Big car companies like G.M. have struggled to move as quickly as Tesla and some industry observers remain skeptical.
The United States, where G.M. is strongest, accounts for only 11 percent of global sales of electric vehicles. China, where G.M. has struggled, accounts for 69 percent. Even if G.M. makes gains in E.V.s in the United States, "they are going to be leading sales in a market that is still moving slowly," said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars, a used car website.
But as the market for electric vehicles expands, G.M.'s ability to churn out millions of cars -- everything from Cadillac Escalades that can sell for more than $ 150,000 to the Chevrolet Trax, which retails for around $ 25,000 -- may give it an advantage.
G.M. offers nine electric vehicles from its Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC and delivery van divisions, including the Cadillac Lyriq, made in Spring Hill. That's roughly twice as many models as Tesla, which gets most of its sales from two products. G.M. has plans to introduce several more models in the coming months.
Strong sales of gasoline and diesel vehicles have helped G.M. ride out fluctuations in electric vehicle demand, Mr. Kelty noted. "Maybe I shouldn't say that," he said, "but it's bringing in a lot of profits that enable us to do some really creative things and really invest in the future."
The Spring Hill battery plant, with automated assembly lines overseen by workers dressed in gray full-body suits to protect the sensitive machines from contamination, has allowed G.M. and LG to become one of the biggest makers of batteries in the United States. That puts the company in a position to reap cost savings that come with mass production.
The cells are two feet long and encased in silvery pouches. Twenty-four cells are packed into a module, which in turn are tethered together in battery packs. The number of modules varies based on the size of the vehicle and their driving range. Using the same battery modules for many different vehicles cuts costs.
By building batteries in the United States, G.M. can take advantage of federal subsidies that will be worth $ 800 million to the company this year. The incentives were included in the Inflation Reduction Act, part of the Biden administration's effort to create a battery industry that is not dependent on China.
Those subsidies are at risk. Mr. Trump has vowed to repeal or undermine President Biden's auto and energy policies. That will present a conundrum for the Republicans who dominate politics in Tennessee, Georgia and other Southern states that have benefited the most from the I.R.A.
G.M.'s investment in Spring Hill, which once produced Saturn cars, has turned the small city, set amid rolling green farmland, into a boom town. The 2020 census put the population at 50,000, but Jim Hagaman, the mayor, said the town may now have as many as 65,000 residents.
Mr. Hagaman, who is not affiliated with a political party, said he was confident that G.M.'s investment in Spring Hill was not dependent on politics. "They'll still build cars," he said.
Ms. Barra agreed. "Long before we knew what the I.R.A. was or that it was going to actually pass, we had set this strategy," she said.
Representative Andy Ogles, a Republican and a Trump supporter whose district includes Spring Hill, did not reply to a request for comment.
Political pressure is also coming from car dealers, who tend to support Republicans.
Mickey Anderson, president of Baxter Auto Group, a chain of dealerships in Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado, said dealers like him generally agreed with Ms. Barra that electric vehicles "are the future." But, he added, Mr. Biden's clean air standards "are completely out of alignment with today's consumer demand."
Mr. Anderson leads a group of 5,000 dealers, including many who sell Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, that has pushed policymakers to ease penalties on carmakers that do not ramp up production of electric vehicles and hybrids over time.
Ms. Barra argues that electric vehicles will be popular regardless of who is in office. The electric Equinox will be cheaper to own than its gasoline-powered equivalent, taking into account savings on fuel and maintenance. And as the U.S. charging network grows, owners will be less afraid about running out of power on a lonely road.
Even the least expensive Equinox has the lively acceleration typical of electric vehicles. And next year, G.M. will revive the Chevrolet Bolt, which will be even more affordable than the Equinox.
"The consumer," Ms. Barra said, "will choose an E.V. because there's a robust charging infrastructure, because it's affordable" and, she added, because "they love it."

Cassettes Are Back. Now Find a Tape Deck.: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Musicians and fans have developed a new taste for an old format, but manufacturers largely stopped making players. Listeners are finding creative (and vintage) solutions.
When Taylor Swift released "1989 (Taylor's Version)" in an array of physical formats last year, Cora Buel knew she had to get the cassette right away. Buel, a 48-year-old based in Daly City, Calif., is a fan of Swift's music -- an affinity she shares with her teenage daughter, who has since bought her mother more tapes as gifts. One main reason? Buel drives a 1998 BMW Z3, and has no other convenient options for on-the-road album playback.
"Just get an old car that only plays cassettes," Buel said, "and you'll listen every day."
Although Buel might be an extreme proponent of retro design -- she works as chief revenue officer at ThredUp, an online consignment store -- the cassette's return is by now almost as unmistakable as the format's distinctive hiss and warble.
Dominant in the United States from the early 1980s until it was overtaken commercially by the compact disc in the early 1990s, the cassette tape has survived as an underground phenomenon, a deliberately anachronistic medium of choice for artists on the noise, avant-garde and low-fi fringes. But tapes began turning up at the trend-chasing retailer Urban Outfitters as long ago as 2015, the same year that digital streaming first overtook download sales. Nearly a decade later, Swift's latest album, "The Tortured Poets Department," stands as the top-selling cassette of the year so far, with about 23,000 copies sold through June 30, according to the tracking service Luminate.
Sure, cassette sales of Swift's new album pale beside its performance in even other physical formats, where it boasts sales of 1.1 million copies on CD and another 988,000 on vinyl. But "Tortured Poets" alone is on pace to beat the total annual sales of all albums on cassette for as recently as 2009, when the Luminate precursor Nielsen SoundScan reported a mere 34,000 units shipped. If Spotify killed the iTunes star, and vinyl is increasingly a high-priced luxury item -- never mind CDs for the moment -- then cassettes could be the cockroaches that outlive them all.
As labels look to capitalize on "superfans" who will buy multiple formats, artists releasing new music on cassette this year cross genres and generations. A sampling of musicians embracing the format includes: the pop polymath Charli XCX, the alternative-rock titan Kim Deal, the adventurous South Florida rapper Denzel Curry, the outré Thom Yorke band the Smile, the black-metal group Darkthrone, the pop-rock duo Twenty One Pilots, the meditative electronic producer Tycho, the masked country singer Orville Peck, the folk-pop troubadour Shawn Mendes, the reigning pop wunderkind Billie Eilish, the garage-rocker Ty Segall, the alt-pop eclecticist Remi Wolf and the sultry singer-songwriter Omar Apollo.
Though the last new car to be factory-equipped with a cassette deck was reportedly a 2010 Lexus, more than a quarter of light-duty vehicles on the road are at least 15 years old, according to a recent analysis by S&P Global Mobility. Susanna Thomson of the Oakland, Calif., band Sour Widows still listens to cassettes in her 1998 Volvo wagon, which has a tape deck and a CD player. "I-90," a song on the alternative-rock group's bittersweet new album, "Revival of a Friend," includes lyrics about driving down the interstate while singing along repeatedly to a beloved cassette; the tape in question was by the Southern California punk-rock outfit Joyce Manor.
"I have a little cassette library in my car that just stays there, and I'll rotate tapes out," she said.
At 29, Thomson presumably grew up after the cassette's heyday, but she said that listening to tapes was partly grounded in nostalgia for her. There's an element of protest, too. "Being passionate about cassettes, vinyl, CDs," Thomson said, can be "an act of resistance against the powers-that-be that have their horrible fingers in the world of art." While Thomson also has a Sony Walkman-style portable cassette player, it has a broken part, she said, and she doesn't know how to fix it.
To cassette listeners without access to automobiles of a certain age (and their tape decks), Thomson's tale of a busted Walkman might have a familiar ring. The best-known audio equipment manufacturers of the cassette era have long since exited the market.
Sony sold more than 200 million Walkmans from July 1979, when the devices debuted in Japan, until the music stopped around 2010. Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba and Bose no longer sell audio tape players, representatives for each of the four companies confirmed. The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group, stopped tracking sales of combination radio/cassette/CD players in 2016, when there were an estimated 653,671 units shipped, compared with a likely peak of around 25 million radio/cassette combos in 1994, according to a spokesperson.
Although the market for new cassette players became too small to bother measuring, a vast supply of the ostensibly obsolete gadgets was already in existence, in various states of repair, waiting to be rediscovered.
Liam Dwyer, the 20-year-old general director of WXBC, the student-run radio station at Bard College, originally got into tapes because an older Volkswagen that belonged to Dwyer's father had a cassette deck in it. While there's a tape deck at the station, Dwyer (who uses they/them pronouns) recently found a cassette player at school that someone was giving away -- a Technics, model unknown. "I haven't tested it yet, but I believe that it will work, or I will fix it up," they said.
Dwyer has been looking into acquiring a Walkman for portable use, partly because of an interest in how artists like Liz Harris, a.k.a. Grouper, incorporate tapes into sound art and instrumental music. The first tapes Dwyer picked up were by Golden Boy, a "breakcore" artist from their own hometown, Portland, Ore., and the music that Dwyer listens to on cassette is mainly electronic and experimental. A double cassette from the Frank Ocean associate Vegyn was a staple in the Volkswagen, but "the car, unfortunately, had to be towed."
If cassettes are popular, it's in part because they are cheap for do-it-yourself artists and independent labels to get made. For one recent title on Jack White's Third Man Records, cassettes cost $ 2.80 apiece to produce versus $ 6.92 per vinyl LP, Ben Blackwell, one of the label's founders, said. Tape enthusiasts' preferences in playback devices can be similarly economical.
Indeed, the main reason people buy used physical media, including cassettes, is to "get a bunch of stuff for a low price and then engage with it," said Mike Hunchback, a co-owner of Brooklyn Record Exchange. He noted that his customers tend to seek out used cassette players at thrift shops, at record stores like his or online. "The majority of people that are listening to cassettes now that I sell to, they are using a cassette player that is at least 20 years old," Hunchback said. "And the function of that cassette player is to listen to cassettes for fun."
He emphasized that enjoying old music need not require large amounts of disposable wealth, and he contended that "the overwhelming majority" of working cassette players from 25 years ago -- including unopened devices that purportedly can still be found collecting dust behind the counters of the city's delis and bodegas -- will meet listeners' needs. "The joy of it is to actually listen to it," he stressed.
That said, some who listen to vintage cassettes may also understandably have an appreciation for vintage audio gear. Johannes Stoeber, the general manager at Rutgers University's student-run radio station, WRSU, collects audio equipment, mainly for analog forms of playback, and he listens to cassettes on a recorder and playback machine from Nakamichi, a high-end Japanese company. A former musician in a symphony orchestra, Stoeber, 20, tries to emulate that experience of being "enveloped by the music" in his home listening. "I listen to cassettes and other physical forms of media mostly as a way to have more of an interaction with the music," he said.
Stoeber favors reel-to-reel or vinyl for classical music listening, but argues that rock from the 1960s and '70s goes well on cassette, and so does pop. While he's drawn to the tactile nature of working with tapes, as well as their versatility, Stoeber also contended that cassettes, including high-performing Type 2 and Type 4 tapes, can have a sonic character that's preferable to other formats, analogue media types among them. "Digital music is flat," Stoeber said. "Often vinyl can feel that way too, because it doesn't have the occasional bit of wow and flutter that introduces a little life into it."
Some new manufacturers have entered the cassette market, meeting a simmering demand but confronting a vastly different supply-side landscape than in the 1990s. FiiO, an electronics company with headquarters in Guangzhou, China, recently debuted a bare-bones, Walkman-style cassette player that sells for about $ 100. "The biggest challenge has been the near-complete disruption of the cassette player supply chain," the company's chief executive, James Chung, said in an emailed statement. "Restoring the technical prowess of 1990s Walkman devices is virtually impossible today." Then again, vinyl record production has largely overcome a similar supply squeeze in the past decade.
A Paris-based startup called We Are Rewind introduced its own minimalist, Walkman-like tape player via Kickstarter in 2020, citing inspiration from the timeworn cassette deck at the heart of the "Guardians of the Galaxy" film franchise, as well as from the 1980s-retro Netflix smash series "Stranger Things." Retailing for about $ 160 and up, We Are Rewind's portable tape machines also offer Bluetooth connectivity for wireless listening.
While the company's chief executive, Romain Boudruche, acknowledged an initial struggle to find suppliers, he said We Are Rewind sold almost 20,000 cassette players last year and hopes to double that number in 2024. He outlined plans for a smaller version and a boombox, plus collaborations with artists and brands. "The possibilities are really big, even if it's a still a niche," Boudruche said.
The North Carolina rapper Rapsody, who made her cassette debut earlier this year with a limited-edition tape of her new album, "Please Don't Cry," grew up listening to the format, but she first encountered its rebirth a couple of years ago: Her fellow Kendrick Lamar collaborator, Ab-Soul, sent her a package with a cassette of his 2022 album "Herbert" and, as it happens, a We Are Rewind player. Although Rapsody's tape has sold out twice, she was surprised at first to find out that her fans were listening to it. "I thought it was a collector's item," she explained. "But people really want the experience."
That's not to say that all cassettes sold these days are actually being played. "As with vinyl, most aren't really worried about that," Carl Mello, brand engagement director for Newbury Comics, wrote in an email. Mello noted, however, that Newbury Comics, a music and collectibles chain based in the Northeast, has been selling 30 units a month of a "cheapy" Walkman-style portable tape player by Jensen, "more than we sell of any individual turntable model."
The Haitian American rapper Mach-Hommy offers a nuanced perspective on cassettes. He has released oodles of them -- including this year's "Richaxxhaitian" -- and some of his tapes are listed for thousands of dollars on the resale website Discogs (which, by the way, has about 87,000 active listenings for cassettes released since 2020). But he is also a longtime listener, with his own hand-me-down dual-well cassette deck and vivid memories of perhaps ill-advisedly taping over one of his father's cassettes as a child. He has a Walkman, he said, but he doesn't use it much.
While Mach-Hommy said he's flattered by the resale values, he expressed ambivalence about what people do with the music on his tapes, whether that's push play or try to flip for profit. "I made it to listen to," he said. "But I've heard accounts of people being able to take some of these pieces, resell them, and open a business or buy a car, or steer themselves out of homelessness and destitution." In the end, he added, "it's up to you."

Full text: LVMH and Samsung intruded on previously sacrosanct spaces at the Paris Games, angering fellow sponsors and raising concerns about a repeat at the closing ceremony.
When the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH agreed to pay about $ 175 million to underwrite the organizing committee for the Paris Olympics, the company, owned by France's richest person, Bernard Arnault, asked for more than any previous sponsor had ever done. Organizers of the Games, desperate for that cash, appeared to have said yes at every turn.
The medals? Made by the LVMH-owned jeweler Chaumet. The French parade uniforms? Made by the LVMH-owned label Berluti. The medal trays for every event? The unmistakable checkerboard pattern of Louis Vuitton. And on and on it went. But there was one secret that had been held back, Antoine Arnault, who is Bernard Arnault's son and the family's representative to the Olympics, told a gathering of well-heeled Parisians on the eve of the Games.
Keep an eye out, he and other LVMH executives said, for "a big surprise" involving the company.
In the end it was hard to miss. Among the parade of athletes cruising along the River Seine was one vessel carrying different cargo: suitcases and trunks encased in Louis Vuitton leather. The Louis V was just one part of the show, an hourslong broadcast that also featured a long video segment beamed to millions of people worldwide that showed the making of the trunk and then panned to dancers in LVMH-designed clothing.
The audacious segment -- effectively a three-minute advertisement for LVMH during one of the most eagerly anticipated events of the Games -- left some longtime Olympic executives slack-jawed. But it also outraged several of the International Olympic Committee's top partners, billion-dollar companies that have been involved with the Games for far longer than LVMH.
"I was very surprised to see the level of LVMH branding in the ceremony," said Ricardo Fort, a former executive responsible for events like the Olympics and the soccer World Cup at Coca-Cola, whose Olympic partnership dates to the Amsterdam Games in 1928. "This is so unusual I can't even think about another opening ceremony where a brand had such a visible role."
Michael Payne, who devised the I.O.C.'s original marketing strategy of partnering with a handful of deep-pocketed and long-term global partners in each Olympic cycle, said the committee would have "some explaining to do" to its partners -- if only to reassure them that there would not be a repeat in the closing ceremony on Sunday.
Asked if LVMH's exposure during the opening ceremony would now be the norm for powerful sponsors, Tak Kosugi, the head of Olympic marketing at Panasonic, another longtime I.O.C. partner, blew out his cheeks, leaned back in his chair and pushed his head backward. "Tough question," he said, before offering his thoughts in the most diplomatic language he could muster.
Kosugi noted that not just LVMH, but more than 20 sponsors -- both global companies and French ones -- had paid handsomely to be associated with the Paris Olympics, and he offered a reminder that the Games' policy has always been different than that of any other major sporting event when it comes to sponsor visibility on the field of play.
The field of play at the Olympics, which includes the opening ceremony, is supposed to be "clean," he said: shorn of the type of branding that is ubiquitous at huge global events like the World Cups of soccer, rugby and cricket. That principle imposes tight restrictions on what partners, however much they spend, can do.
"Once you do something like that it might be very similar to other sporting events," Kosugi said. Panasonic, whose links to the Olympics date to the 1984 Los Angeles Games, had more reason than most to be frustrated by the opening ceremony: In another long scene, a D.J. performed behind a mixer made by a rival company with its logo highly visible; furious, the company fired off a complaint to the I.O.C. Kosugi declined to comment on that. So did the I.O.C.
Two senior I.O.C. officials said that, had they been aware of how long and how brazen LVMH's opening ceremony video would be, they would have insisted on cuts to the segment. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid damaging professional relationships with partners.
"We knew the content," the I.O.C.'s chief spokesman, Mark Adams, said without clarifying if Olympic officials were aware of the entirety of the sequence before it was broadcast.
Anne Descamps, a spokeswoman for the Paris organizing committee, said highlighting LVMH allowed organizers to show the world France's strength in the luxury sector.
But the episodes shed a light on how hard sponsors need to work to defend and promote valuable marketing rights, acquired at great expense, to the Olympic Games.
Historically, sponsors have been required to discreetly integrate their businesses into the event if they harbor any hope of being visible on the field of play. That has included large red clocks made by the Games' timekeeping partner, Omega; bottles of Powerade, which is owned by Coca-Cola, being handed to athletes; and in-stadium screens provided by Panasonic.
But some of the subtleties of previous Games have been replaced with more obvious commercial opportunities this year.
After the American gymnast Simone Biles secured victory in the all-around, one of the most popular and most-watched events of any Olympics, she stood atop the podium having been delivered her gold medal, lifted off a Louis Vuitton tray, by the I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach.
Moments later, after the United States national anthem boomed out of the loudspeakers in the Bercy Arena, a young woman dressed in LVMH-designed apparel crept up to the bronze medalist, Sunisa Lee of the United States, and handed her a Samsung phone. Lee took hold of it and eagerly posed for a selfie on the podium with Biles and Rebeca Andrade of Brazil, the silver medalist. The scene would be repeated hundreds of times across the Games.
"For me the medal rostrum is sacred and not the place to play with sponsorship," said Payne, who, in his two decades at the I.O.C., zealously guarded against the intrusion of brands into places they did not have permission to be. That zero-tolerance policy from the I.O.C., he said, applied even to official sponsors -- most famously, he said, during the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Games.
Made aware that a McDonald's restaurant inside the Olympic Village had strategically placed its logo on a pole so that it could be viewed from inside the stadium during the athletes parade when lit, Payne urgently sent staff members to the restaurant to demand that it be turned off.
When the staff members reported back that the restaurant was closed, Payne told them to break in and cut the electricity supply. "By the time we got to Djibouti" -- still very near the front of the procession alphabetically -- "the electric was cut off and the sign was off," he said.
In the years since, however, there has been a creeping commercialization. More and more space has been given to partners, even in previously sacrosanct spaces like the opening ceremony and the medal stand, and never more so than in Paris. Interview backdrops have featured corporate logos and companies operate in Games-adjacent spaces like the Champions Park, a location branded by Panasonic, where medal winners come to show off their medals to adoring fans.
Anne-Sophie Voumard, the I.O.C.'s director of television and marketing services, suggested there will be even more branded innovation in the years ahead as Olympic officials try to balance traditions with the needs of sponsors who contribute more than $ 2 billion per Olympic cycle.
"We have been historically trying to work with our partners," she said, "to have a very smooth organic integration and ways for us to be actually promoting their products in a way that helps with the delivery of the Games or with the experience. And the victory selfie is exactly that example."
She added that the I.O.C. "will continue to evolve in this respect and try to be smart about how we continue to integrate our partners."
In Los Angeles, which will host the Summer Games in 2028, organizers and sponsor alike will have seen what Paris did to test the boundaries, Payne said.
"The creatives in L.A. will be going 'goody, goody, goody,"' he added. "It won't be easy to put the genie back in the bottle."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Employers have taken steps to change a male-dominated workplace culture. But women still struggle to balance their careers with domestic obligations.
When the future empress of Japan entered the country's elite diplomatic corps in 1987, a year after a major equal employment law went into effect, she was one of only three female recruits. Known then as Masako Owada, she worked long hours and had a rising career as a trade negotiator. But she lasted just under six years in the job, giving it up to marry Crown Prince -- and now Emperor -- Naruhito.
Much has changed for Japan's Foreign Ministry -- and, in some ways, for Japanese women more broadly -- in the ensuing three decades.
Since 2020, women have comprised nearly half of each entering class of diplomats, and many women continue their careers after they marry. These advances, in a country where women were predominantly hired only for clerical positions into the 1980s, show how the simple power of numbers can, however slowly, begin to remake workplace cultures and create a pipeline for leadership.
For years, Japan has promoted women in the workplace to aid its sputtering economy. Private-sector employers have taken some steps, like encouraging male employees to do more around the house, or setting limits on after-work outings that can complicate child care. But many women still struggle to balance their careers with domestic obligations.
The Foreign Ministry, led by a woman, Yoko Kamikawa, exceeds both other government agencies and familiar corporate names like Mitsubishi, Panasonic and SoftBank in an important sign of progress: its placement of women in career-track, professional jobs.
With more women in the ministry's ranks, said Kotono Hara, a diplomat, "the way of working is drastically changing," with more flexible hours and the option to work remotely.
Ms. Hara was one of only six women who joined the ministry in 2005. Last year, she was the event manager for a meeting of world leaders that Japan hosted in Hiroshima.
In the run-up to the Group of 7 summit, she worked in the office until 6:30 p.m. and then went home to feed and bathe her preschool-age child, before checking in with her team online later in the night. Earlier in her career, she assumed such a job was not the "kind of position that would be done by a mommy."
Some of the progress for women at the Foreign Ministry has come as men from elite universities have turned instead to high-paying banking and consulting jobs, and educated women have come to see the public sector as appealing.
Yet as women move up in the diplomatic corps, they -- like their counterparts at other employers -- must juggle long working hours on top of shouldering the bulk of the duties on the home front.
Ministry staff members often work until 9 or 10 at night, and sometimes much later. Those hours tend to fall more heavily on women, said Shiori Kusuda, 29, who joined the ministry seven years ago and departed earlier this year for a consulting job in Tokyo.
Many of her male bosses at the Foreign Ministry, she said, went home to wives who took care of their meals and laundry, while her female colleagues completed domestic chores themselves. Men are encouraged to take paternity leave, but if they do, it is usually a matter of days or weeks.
Some parts of the culture have changed, Ms. Kusuda said -- male colleagues proactively served her beer at after-work drinking sessions, rather than expecting her to serve them. But for women "who need to do their laundry or cooking after they go home, one hour of overtime work matters a lot," Ms. Kusuda said.
In 2021, the latest year for which government statistics are available, married working women with children took on more than three-quarters of household chores. That load is compounded by the fact that Japanese employees, on average, work nearly 22 hours of overtime a month, according to a survey last year by Doda, a job-hunting website.
In many professions, additional hours are much higher, a reality that prompted the government to recently cap overtime at 45 hours a month.
Before the Equal Opportunity Employment Act went into effect in 1986, women were mostly hired for "ochakumi," or "tea-serving," jobs. Employers rarely recruited women for positions that could lead to executive, managerial or sales jobs.
Today, Japan is turning to women to cope with severe labor shortages. Still, while more than 80 percent of women ages 25 to 54 work, they account for just slightly more than a quarter of full-time, permanent employees. Only about one in eight managers are women, according to government data.
Some executives say women simply choose to limit their careers. Japanese women are "not as ambitious compared to women in the global market," said Tetsu Yamaguchi, the director of global human resources for Fast Retailing, the clothing giant that owns Uniqlo. "Their priority is taking care of their child rather than developing their career."
Worldwide, 45 percent of the company's managers are women. In Japan, that proportion is just over a quarter.
Experts say the onus is on employers to make it easier for women to combine professional success and motherhood. Career barriers for women could hurt the broader economy, and as the nation's birthrate dwindles, crushing expectations at work and at home can discourage ambitious women from having children.
At Sony, just one in nine of its managers in Japan are women. The company is taking small measures to support working mothers, such as offering courses for prospective fathers in which they are taught to change diapers and feed infants.
During a recent class at the company's Tokyo headquarters, Satoko Sasaki, 35, who was seven months pregnant, watched her husband, Yudai, 29, a Sony software engineer, strap on a prosthetic belly simulating the physical sensations of pregnancy.
Ms. Sasaki, who works as an administrator at another company in Tokyo, said she was moved that her husband's employer was trying to help men "understand my situation."
At her own company, she said, tearing up, "I don't have much support" from senior male colleagues.
Takayuki Kosaka, the course instructor, displayed a graph showing the time invested at home by a typical mother and father during the first 100 days of an infant's life.
"The dad isn't doing anything!" said Mr. Kosaka, pointing at a blue bar representing the father's time working from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. "If he's coming home at 11 p.m., doesn't that mean that he also went out drinking?" he added.
After-work drinking parties with colleagues are all but obligatory at many Japanese companies, exacerbating the overwork culture. To curtail such commitments, Itochu, a conglomerate that owns the convenience store chain Family Mart among other businesses, mandates that all such parties end by 10 p.m. -- still a time that makes child care difficult.
Rina Onishi, 24, who works at Itochu's Tokyo headquarters, said she attended such parties three times a week. That is progress, she said: In the past, there were many more.
Drinking nights come on top of long days. The company now allows staff members to start working as early as 5 a.m., a policy intended in part to support parents who want to leave earlier. But many employees still work overtime. Ms. Onishi arrives at the office by 7:30 a.m. and typically stays until after 6 p.m.
Some women set limits on their work hours, even if it means forgoing promotions. Maiko Itagaki, 48, labored at a punishing pace as an advertising copywriter before landing in the hospital with a cerebral hemorrhage. After recovering, she married and gave birth to a son. But she was at the office when her mother called to tell her she had missed her son's first steps.
"I thought, 'Why am I working?"' Ms. Itagaki said.
She moved to a firm that conducts direct mail campaigns where she clocks in at 9 a.m. and out at 6 p.m. She declined a promotion to management. "I thought I would end up sacrificing my private time," she said. "It felt like they just wanted me to do everything."
At the Foreign Ministry, Hikariko Ono, Japan's ambassador to Hungary, was the only woman out of 26 diplomats hired in 1988.
She postponed having a child out of fear that her bosses would think she did not take her career seriously. These days, she reminds younger female colleagues that if they want to have children, they are not alone.
"You can rely on the day-care center or your parents or friends," she said. "Or even, of course, your husband."

Musk's Reliance on China Draws Rising Scrutiny: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tesla and China built a symbiotic relationship, with credits, workers and parts that made Mr. Musk ultrarich. Now, his reliance on the country may give Beijing leverage.
When Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas in Shanghai in 2020, he went off script and started dancing. Peeling off his jacket, he flung it across the stage in a partial striptease.
Mr. Musk had reason to celebrate. A few years earlier, with Tesla on the brink of failure, he had bet on China, which offered cheap parts and capable workers -- and which needed Tesla as an anchor to jump-start its fledgling electric vehicle industry.
For Chinese leaders, the prize was a Tesla factory on domestic soil. Mr. Musk would build one in Shanghai that would become a flagship, accounting for over half of Tesla's global deliveries and the bulk of its profits.
Mr. Musk initially seemed to have the upper hand in the relationship, securing concessions from China that were rarely offered to foreign businesspeople. But in a stark shift, Tesla is now increasingly in trouble and losing its edge over Chinese competitors in the very market he helped create. Tesla's China pivot has also tethered Mr. Musk to Beijing in a way that is drawing scrutiny from U.S. policymakers.
Interviews with former Tesla employees, diplomats and policymakers reveal how Mr. Musk built an unusually symbiotic relationship with Beijing, profiting from the Chinese government's largess even as he reaped subsidies in the United States.
As Mr. Musk explored building the factory in Shanghai, Chinese leaders agreed to a crucial policy change on national emissions regulations, following lobbying by Tesla that was not previously reported. That change directly benefited Tesla, bringing in an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars in profits as China production took off, The New York Times found.
Mr. Musk also gained unusual access to senior leaders. He worked closely with a top Shanghai official who is now the premier, Li Qiang. The Shanghai factory went up at lightning speed and without a local partner, a first for a foreign auto company in China.
Mr. Musk, who has insinuated that American workers are lazy, got employees accustomed to long hours, without the strong protections that have led U.S. and European regulators to scrutinize Tesla and unions to target it for organizing. After a Tesla worker in Shanghai was crushed to death last year, a report citing safety gaps was taken offline.
And he got the emissions policy. Modeled after a California program that has been a boon for Tesla, the policy awards automakers credits for making clean cars. To lobby for the regulatory change, Tesla teamed up with California environmentalists, who were trying to clean up China's soupy skies.
China helped make Tesla the most valuable car company in the world. But Tesla's success there also forced homegrown brands to innovate. China is now churning out cheap but well-made electric cars, as the Chinese leader Xi Jinping aims to transform the country into an "automotive power." Chinese automakers like BYD and SAIC are pushing into Europe, threatening established carmakers like Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis. Detroit is also scrambling to keep pace.
"There's Before Tesla and After Tesla," said Michael Dunne, an auto consultant and a former General Motors executive in Asia, about the company's effect on Chinese industry. "Tesla was the rainmaker."
'Kind of Pro-China'
Mr. Musk is now treading a fine line. He has sounded the alarm about Chinese rivals, even as he remains reliant on the Chinese market and supply chain and repeats Beijing's geopolitical talking points.
He warned in January that unless the Chinese auto brands were blocked by trade barriers, they would "pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world." Earlier this month, Tesla's share price plunged following lagging China sales, causing him to lose the title of richest man in the world.
The company is so ensconced in China that Mr. Musk cannot easily extricate himself, should he ever want to. Teslas cost significantly less to make in Shanghai than elsewhere, a key saving when the company is in a price war with its competitors.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are studying his ties to China and how he balances Tesla with his other endeavors. SpaceX, another company he owns, has lucrative Pentagon contracts and boasts near total control of the world's satellite internet through its Starlink network. He also owns the social media platform X, which China has used for disinformation campaigns.
"Elon Musk has deep financial exposure to China -- including his plant in Shanghai," said Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee.
It's not clear whether Beijing has sought to exert leverage over Mr. Musk, but leaders have levers they could pull. Last year, several Chinese localities banned Teslas from sensitive areas, prompting the automaker to emphasize that all Chinese data is held locally. And in February, after the Commerce Department announced an investigation into data retention by Chinese electric vehicles, the Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, warned that Chinese consumers could retaliate against Tesla.
Mr. Musk has taken China's side in several international disputes. He has made China's case for why it should control Taiwan, the self-governed island democracy that has resisted Beijing's claims. (Taiwan is now building an alternative to Starlink, in part because of concerns about Mr. Musk's ties.)
Mr. Musk has reportedly argued that there are two sides to repression in Xinjiang, home to the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs. In 2021, as other companies were pulling back from Xinjiang, Tesla unveiled a charging line ending there, which it called the Tesla Silk Road, after the historic route that has been revived by Mr. Xi in a campaign for global influence. The company has a similar charging line to Tibet.
Tesla, SpaceX and Mr. Musk did not reply to a detailed list of questions and findings. At The New York Times's DealBook Summit on Nov. 29, Mr. Musk said that "every car company" relies in part on the Chinese market. He also dismissed concerns surrounding SpaceX and Starlink, saying they did not operate in China and that his companies should not be conflated.
But in an online conversation with two members of Congress in July, he was more direct. He acknowledged having "some vested interests" in China, and described himself as "kind of pro-China."
Tesla's First Big Win in China
In California, Tesla has enjoyed strong regulatory support. Since 2008, when it unveiled its first car, the company has earned cash under the state's emissions mandate by selling credits to automakers that could not meet pollution targets. Those credits were worth $ 3.71 billion by late 2023, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office.
Mr. Musk has downplayed Tesla's reliance on government help, but Alberto Ayala, a former emissions regulator for California, said that the policy helped Tesla survive when it was struggling. "That is what kept the company afloat."
Another former state regulator, Craig Segall, said that Tesla lobbied extensively on the emissions regulations, seeking to skew them in a way that enriched Tesla.
In China, the company aimed to recreate California's lucrative policy.
As California built ties with China, several groups were championing an emissions mandate as a cure for its pollution. Among the policy's enthusiasts was then-Gov. Jerry Brown, who saw electric vehicles as a potential area of cooperation. Environmentalists were on board as well.
In 2014, as Mr. Musk talked about setting up a factory in China, Tesla joined the groups in pushing for a change.
Grace Tao, a Tesla lobbyist, met with people at the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation, an environmental nonprofit based in Los Angeles and Beijing. The group, also known as iCET, had approached Tesla. They talked about working together on an emissions mandate in the country, according to notes taken by the nonprofit and shared with The Times.
"They needed that to be successful in China," Feng An, iCET's executive director, said about Tesla. But Chinese officials were initially skeptical, he added, because the policy would effectively require traditional automakers to subsidize E.V. companies like Tesla.
His group helped plan meetings with Ken Morgan, then a U.S.-based Tesla lobbyist, according to event materials and emails obtained by The Times. In 2015, Mr. Morgan met with officials in three Chinese cities, touting how California's emissions mandate had helped spur E.V. production. (Ms. Tao and Mr. Morgan, who recently left Tesla, did not respond to questions.)
Local officials were keen to persuade Tesla to build a factory in their cities. That interest could "potentially be leveraged" to promote a mandate, Maya Ben Dror, who worked for iCET at the time, wrote in an email to Mr. Morgan.
Dr. An said he took two groups of Chinese city officials to visit Tesla's office in California, adding that neither Tesla nor Mr. Musk gave iCET any money. He and Ms. Ben Dror saw the emissions scheme as sound environmental policy.
The priorities of the environmentalists and Chinese officials often differed. In the West, clean transportation was seen as a "tree-hugging kind of issue, while in China it was from the start seen as an industrial issue," said Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who studied the emissions policy discussions.
But as an innovative green business, Tesla checked both boxes.
In 2015, at a clean transportation conference in California, Chinese central government officials listened as a Tesla lobbyist laid out the reasons that Beijing should adopt an emissions mandate, said Yunshi Wang, an energy economist who organized the session.
"Obviously Tesla was all in," said Dr. Wang, director of the University of California-Davis's China Center for Energy and Transportation.
The emissions mandate eventually appealed to the officials, too. The existing government subsidy system was rife with fraud. The mandate was more efficient and would save the government money.
In 2017, China adopted the policy.
It was Tesla's first big win there.
Tesla's Factory Goes Up at Record Speed
Mr. Musk did not want to share ownership of Tesla's factory with a Chinese company, as was required at the time. So in 2018 officials revoked the rule for all foreign electric car companies. The change was Tesla's second big win.
Soon after, Shanghai beat out other cities competing for Tesla's factory. Mr. Li, then Shanghai's top leader, became a key ally. He had visited Tesla in California, on a trip that also included a meeting with Governor Brown, Mr. Xi and others about climate cooperation.
Mr. Musk proposed constructing the factory in two years, state media reported. Mr. Li countered that they could do it in one -- a goal that his government met.
"This was even faster than China speed," said Tu Le, who heads the consultancy Sino Auto Insights, adding that Mr. Li's help was key: "How quickly things happened points to his tacit approval of everything."
Government officials used "very creative yet cautious approaches" to bend policy to Tesla's wishes, Ms. Tao told Yicai Global, a Chinese media outlet, adding that she was "deeply impressed."
At least twice, Mr. Musk and his team were allowed to drive Teslas into Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party leadership's walled compound in Beijing.
Under Mr. Li's watch, state-run banks offered Tesla over 11 billion yuan ( $ 1.5 billion) in low-interest loans. The deal was so generous that Huang Yonghe, a senior official with a government-owned auto industry group, recalled one government minister balking at it.
"He said the Shanghai leaders were unbelievable -- giving away the entire investment without Tesla having to spend a penny," Mr. Huang said in an interview.
But Mr. Huang said the deal made sense for the banks.
He had long been impressed by Tesla, at one point importing a car and disassembling it to study how it worked. Like Mr. Li, he had visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., which had struck him as chaotic but promising.
China could improve on it, he thought, yielding an efficient foreign factory that would serve as a "catfish," an aggressive creature that makes other fish swim faster.
Tesla also created a market for Chinese suppliers, saying recently that 95 percent of components used in the Shanghai factory are locally sourced.
One key supplier is a once-obscure battery company. In the United States, Tesla had a partnership with Panasonic, but in China it switched to mainly using batteries from CATL, which built a factory near Tesla's. Today, buoyed in part by Tesla's business, CATL is the world's largest battery maker.
Another supplier, LK Group, developed enormous casting machines that can make an entire section of a car with Tesla's help. The company's founder, Liu Siong Song, told The Times in 2021 that LK planned to supply the machines to six Chinese companies.
That year, he said that he hoped the technology would "help our country's automotive industry become bigger and stronger," linking it to Mr. Xi's "Chinese dream" of national resurgence.
Long Hours at Tesla's Shanghai Plant
Before the Shanghai plant opened, Fremont was Mr. Musk's principal factory. He sometimes slept on the factory floor to model the intensity he expected of his employees.
In China, workers were accustomed to long workweeks, a fact that Mr. Musk saw as an advantage.
The Shanghai plant's schedule involves an unusual weekly change in shifts. According to two former employees, workers there pull four straight twelve-hour day shifts, followed by two days of rest, before switching to four twelve-hour night shifts. (Fremont employees typically work seven twelve-hour shifts over two weeks.)
As the coronavirus pandemic spread in 2020, the Fremont factory was shuttered for nearly two months.
But the Shanghai plant closed for only about two weeks, helping Tesla turn a profit for the first time and causing Mr. Musk's wealth to surge.
China has also offered Mr. Musk an escape from California's strict labor protections.
During Shanghai's 2022 lockdown, some Tesla workers slept on the factory floor. They were paid extra to continue working, but Tesla demanded six twelve-hour shifts in a row, the two workers said. (Employees who chose not to work were also paid, but less than their normal salary.)
Chinese workers "won't even leave the factory," Mr. Musk said at the time, speaking generally, adding, "whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all."
In Fremont, accidents have set off regulatory investigations. But in Shanghai, when the Tesla worker was crushed to death by machinery last year, a report published by city authorities citing safety gaps was taken down shortly after it went online.
The Shanghai government bureau that released the report did not respond to faxed questions.
'May There Be Prosperity for All'
China's vision of Tesla being a catfish for local electric vehicle brands has proved prescient. BYD, a top Chinese rival, overtook Tesla in worldwide sales late last year.
But China's electric vehicle push has prompted anxiety in Europe. "When we decided to shift from thermic engines to E.V.s, we were late vis-à-vis China -- I would say between five and seven years late," said Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister.
In September the European Union started an inquiry into whether Chinese policies give electric vehicle brands there an unfair edge. Although Tesla is not technically under investigation, it could face tariffs on cars exported from China.
In the United States, the Biden administration pushed through the Inflation Reduction Act in an attempt to compete. The White House is now considering raising tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, which are already at 25 percent.
California officials reject the idea that Tesla's rise in China has been bad for the state. "It's not really a zero-sum game," said David Hochschild, chair of the California Energy Commission, who said he saw "robust growth" ahead in E.V.s for both sides.
But Shanghai has replaced Fremont as Tesla's global export hub, sending more than 175,000 cars to Europe from China last year, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
And while the Chinese emissions program brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in credits for Tesla, according to the market analysis company CRU Group, the price of credits is dropping because Chinese companies are manufacturing more electric cars.
"We have reached the tipping point," said Lei Xing, an independent auto analyst focused on China.
Despite rising competition, Mr. Musk remains strong in the country.
In October 2022, Mr. Li, the former Shanghai leader, was promoted to the country's No. 2 spot. Mr. Musk is also building a battery factory in Shanghai, which a state-owned research firm said last year would use CATL cells. When Mr. Musk traveled to China last May, the battery maker's chairman welcomed him with a 16-course banquet. At his side for at least part of the trip was Ms. Tao, the lobbyist, who had risen to the post of vice president at Tesla. (CATL did not respond to questions.)
Even the plant Tesla is building in Nuevo León, Mexico, will use Chinese suppliers, several of whom the state governor has said will set up factories nearby.
Late last year, Mr. Musk attended an exclusive reception for Mr. Xi in San Francisco.
On Weibo, a Chinese social platform, Mr. Musk posted a photo of him shaking hands with the Chinese leader. "May there be prosperity for all," he wrote.

When Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas in Shanghai in 2020, he went off script and started dancing. Peeling off his jacket, he flung it across the stage in a partial striptease.
Musk had reason to celebrate. A few years earlier, with Tesla on the brink of failure, he had bet on China, which offered cheap parts and capable workers — and which needed Tesla as an anchor to jump-start its fledgling electric vehicle industry.
For Chinese leaders, the prize was a Tesla factory on domestic soil. Musk would build one in Shanghai that would become a flagship, accounting for over half of Tesla’s global deliveries and the bulk of its profits.
Musk initially seemed to have the upper hand in the relationship, securing concessions from China that were rarely offered to foreign businesspeople. But in a stark shift, Tesla is now increasingly in trouble and losing its edge over Chinese competitors in the very market he helped create. Tesla’s China pivot has also tethered Musk to Beijing in a way that is drawing scrutiny from U.S. policymakers.
Interviews with former Tesla employees, diplomats and policymakers reveal how Musk built an unusually symbiotic relationship with Beijing, profiting from the Chinese government’s largesse even as he reaped subsidies in the United States.
As Musk explored building the factory in Shanghai, Chinese leaders agreed to a crucial policy change on national emissions regulations, following lobbying by Tesla that was not previously reported. That change directly benefited Tesla, bringing in an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars in profits as China production took off, The New York Times found.
Musk also gained unusual access to senior leaders. He worked closely with a top Shanghai official who is now the premier, Li Qiang. The Shanghai factory went up at lightning speed and without a local partner, a first for a foreign auto company in China.
Musk, who has insinuated that American workers are lazy, got employees accustomed to long hours, without the strong protections that have led U.S. and European regulators to scrutinize Tesla and unions to target it for organizing. After a Tesla worker in Shanghai was crushed to death last year, a report citing safety gaps was taken offline.
And he got the emissions policy. Modeled after a California program that has been a boon for Tesla, the policy awards automakers credits for making clean cars. To lobby for the regulatory change, Tesla teamed up with California environmentalists, who were trying to clean up China’s soupy skies.
China helped make Tesla the most valuable car company in the world. But Tesla’s success there also forced homegrown brands to innovate. China is now churning out cheap but well-made electric cars, as Chinese leader Xi Jinping aims to transform the country into an “automotive power.” Chinese automakers such as BYD and SAIC are pushing into Europe, threatening established carmakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis. Detroit is also scrambling to keep pace.
“There’s Before Tesla and After Tesla,” said Michael Dunne, an auto consultant and a former General Motors executive in Asia, about the company’s effect on Chinese industry. “Tesla was the rainmaker.”
‘Kind of Pro-China’
Musk is now treading a fine line. He has sounded the alarm about Chinese rivals, even as he remains reliant on the Chinese market and supply chain and repeats Beijing’s geopolitical talking points.
He warned in January that unless the Chinese auto brands were blocked by trade barriers, they would “pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world.” This month, Tesla’s share price plunged following lagging China sales, causing him to lose the title of richest man in the world.
The company is so ensconced in China that Musk cannot easily extricate himself, should he ever want to. Teslas cost significantly less to make in Shanghai than elsewhere, a key saving when the company is in a price war with its competitors.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are studying his ties to China and how he balances Tesla with his other endeavors. SpaceX, another company he owns, has lucrative Pentagon contracts and boasts near total control of the world’s satellite internet through its Starlink network. He also owns the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, which China has used for disinformation campaigns.
“Elon Musk has deep financial exposure to China — including his plant in Shanghai,” said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee.
It’s not clear whether Beijing has sought to exert leverage over Musk, but leaders have levers they could pull. Last year, several Chinese localities banned Teslas from sensitive areas, prompting the automaker to emphasize that all Chinese data is held locally. And in February, after the Commerce Department announced an investigation into data retention by Chinese electric vehicles, the Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, warned that Chinese consumers could retaliate against Tesla.
Musk has taken China’s side in several international disputes. He has made China’s case for why it should control Taiwan, the self-governed island democracy that has resisted Beijing’s claims. (Taiwan is now building an alternative to Starlink, in part because of concerns about Musk’s ties.)
Musk has reportedly argued that there are two sides to repression in Xinjiang, home to the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs. In 2021, as other companies were pulling back from Xinjiang, Tesla unveiled a charging line ending there, which it called the Tesla Silk Road, after the historic route that has been revived by Xi in a campaign for global influence. The company has a similar charging line to Tibet.
Tesla, SpaceX and Musk did not reply to a detailed list of questions and findings. At The New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Nov. 29, Musk said that “every car company” relies in part on the Chinese market. He also dismissed concerns surrounding SpaceX and Starlink, saying they did not operate in China and that his companies should not be conflated.
But in an online conversation with two members of Congress in July, he was more direct. He acknowledged having “some vested interests” in China, and described himself as “kind of pro-China.”
Tesla’s First Big Win in China
In California, Tesla has enjoyed strong regulatory support. Since 2008, when it unveiled its first car, the company has earned cash under the state’s emissions mandate by selling credits to automakers that could not meet pollution targets. Those credits were worth $3.71 billion by late 2023, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office.
Musk has downplayed Tesla’s reliance on government help, but Alberto Ayala, a former emissions regulator for California, said the policy helped Tesla survive when it was struggling: “That is what kept the company afloat.”
Another former state regulator, Craig Segall, said Tesla lobbied extensively on the emissions regulations, seeking to skew them in a way that enriched Tesla.
In China, the company aimed to recreate California’s lucrative policy.
As California built ties with China, several groups were championing an emissions mandate as a cure for its pollution. Among the policy’s enthusiasts was then-Gov. Jerry Brown, who saw electric vehicles as a potential area of cooperation. Environmentalists were on board as well.
In 2014, as Musk talked about setting up a factory in China, Tesla joined the groups in pushing for a change.
Grace Tao, a Tesla lobbyist, met with people at the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation, an environmental nonprofit based in Los Angeles and Beijing. The group, also known as iCET, had approached Tesla. They talked about working together on an emissions mandate in the country, according to notes taken by the nonprofit and shared with the Times.
“They needed that to be successful in China,” Feng An, iCET’s executive director, said about Tesla. But Chinese officials were initially skeptical, he added, because the policy would effectively require traditional automakers to subsidize EV companies like Tesla.
His group helped plan meetings with Ken Morgan, then a U.S.-based Tesla lobbyist, according to event materials and emails obtained by the Times. In 2015, Morgan met with officials in three Chinese cities, touting how California’s emissions mandate had helped spur EV production. (Tao and Morgan, who recently left Tesla, did not respond to questions.)
Local officials were keen to persuade Tesla to build a factory in their cities. That interest could “potentially be leveraged” to promote a mandate, Maya Ben Dror, who worked for iCET at the time, wrote in an email to Morgan.
An said he took two groups of Chinese city officials to visit Tesla’s office in California, adding that neither Tesla nor Musk gave iCET any money. He and Ben Dror saw the emissions scheme as sound environmental policy.
The priorities of the environmentalists and Chinese officials often differed. In the West, clean transportation was seen as a “tree-hugging kind of issue, while in China it was from the start seen as an industrial issue,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who studied the emissions policy discussions.
But as an innovative green business, Tesla checked both boxes.
In 2015, at a clean transportation conference in California, Chinese central government officials listened as a Tesla lobbyist laid out the reasons that Beijing should adopt an emissions mandate, said Yunshi Wang, an energy economist who organized the session.
“Obviously Tesla was all in,” said Wang, director of the University of California, Davis’ China Center for Energy and Transportation.
The emissions mandate eventually appealed to the officials, too. The existing government subsidy system was rife with fraud. The mandate was more efficient and would save the government money.
In 2017, China adopted the policy.
It was Tesla’s first big win there.
Tesla’s Factory Goes Up at Record Speed
Musk did not want to share ownership of Tesla’s factory with a Chinese company, as was required at the time. So in 2018 officials revoked the rule for all foreign electric car companies. The change was Tesla’s second big win.
Soon after, Shanghai beat out other cities competing for Tesla’s factory. Li, then Shanghai’s top leader, became a key ally. He had visited Tesla in California, on a trip that also included a meeting with Brown, Xi and others about climate cooperation.
Musk proposed constructing the factory in two years, state media reported. Li countered that they could do it in one — a goal that his government met.
“This was even faster than China speed,” said Tu Le, who heads the consultancy Sino Auto Insights, adding that Li’s help was key: “How quickly things happened points to his tacit approval of everything.”
Government officials used “very creative yet cautious approaches” to bend policy to Tesla’s wishes, Tao told Yicai Global, a Chinese media outlet, adding that she was “deeply impressed.”
At least twice, Musk and his team were allowed to drive Teslas into Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party leadership’s walled compound in Beijing.
Under Li’s watch, state-run banks offered Tesla over 11 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in low-interest loans. The deal was so generous that Huang Yonghe, a senior official with a government-owned auto industry group, recalled one government minister balking at it.
“He said the Shanghai leaders were unbelievable — giving away the entire investment without Tesla having to spend a penny,” Huang said in an interview.
But Huang said the deal made sense for the banks.
He had long been impressed by Tesla, at one point importing a car and disassembling it to study how it worked. Like Li, he had visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, which had struck him as chaotic but promising.
China could improve on it, he thought, yielding an efficient foreign factory that would serve as a “catfish,” an aggressive creature that makes other fish swim faster.
Tesla also created a market for Chinese suppliers, saying recently that 95% of components used in the Shanghai factory are locally sourced.
One key supplier is a once-obscure battery company. In the United States, Tesla had a partnership with Panasonic, but in China it switched to mainly using batteries from CATL, which built a factory near Tesla’s. Today, buoyed in part by Tesla’s business, CATL is the world’s largest battery maker.
Another supplier, LK Group, developed enormous casting machines that can make an entire section of a car with Tesla’s help. The company’s founder, Liu Siong Song, told the Times in 2021 that LK planned to supply the machines to six Chinese companies.
That year, he said that he hoped the technology would “help our country’s automotive industry become bigger and stronger,” linking it to Xi’s “Chinese dream” of national resurgence.
Long Hours at Tesla’s Shanghai Plant
Before the Shanghai plant opened, Fremont was Musk’s principal factory. He sometimes slept on the factory floor to model the intensity he expected of his employees.
In China, workers were accustomed to long workweeks, a fact that Musk saw as an advantage.
The Shanghai plant’s schedule involves an unusual weekly change in shifts. According to two former employees, workers there pull four straight 12-hour day shifts, followed by two days of rest, before switching to four 12-hour night shifts. (Fremont employees typically work seven 12-hour shifts over two weeks.)
As the coronavirus pandemic spread in 2020, the Fremont factory was shuttered for nearly two months.
But the Shanghai plant closed for only about two weeks, helping Tesla turn a profit for the first time and causing Musk’s wealth to surge.
China has also offered Musk an escape from California’s strict labor protections.
During Shanghai’s 2022 lockdown, some Tesla workers slept on the factory floor. They were paid extra to continue working, but Tesla demanded six 12-hour shifts in a row, the two workers said. (Employees who chose not to work were also paid, but less than their normal salary.)
Chinese workers “won’t even leave the factory,” Musk said at the time, speaking generally, adding, “whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.”
In Fremont, accidents have set off regulatory investigations. But in Shanghai, when the Tesla worker was crushed to death by machinery last year, a report published by city authorities citing safety gaps was taken down shortly after it went online.
The Shanghai government bureau that released the report did not respond to faxed questions.
‘May There Be Prosperity for All’
China’s vision of Tesla being a catfish for local electric vehicle brands has proved prescient. BYD, a top Chinese rival, overtook Tesla in worldwide sales late last year.
But China’s electric vehicle push has prompted anxiety in Europe. “When we decided to shift from thermic engines to EVs, we were late vis-à-vis China — I would say between five and seven years late,” said Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister.
In September the European Union started an inquiry into whether Chinese policies give electric vehicle brands there an unfair edge. Although Tesla is not technically under investigation, it could face tariffs on cars exported from China.
In the United States, the Biden administration pushed through the Inflation Reduction Act in an attempt to compete. The White House is now considering raising tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, which are already at 25%.
California officials reject the idea that Tesla’s rise in China has been bad for the state. “It’s not really a zero-sum game,” said David Hochschild, chair of the California Energy Commission, who said he saw “robust growth” ahead in EVs for both sides.
But Shanghai has replaced Fremont as Tesla’s global export hub, sending more than 175,000 cars to Europe from China last year, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
And while the Chinese emissions program brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in credits for Tesla, according to the market analysis company CRU Group, the price of credits is dropping because Chinese companies are manufacturing more electric cars.
“We have reached the tipping point,” said Lei Xing, an independent auto analyst focused on China.
Despite rising competition, Musk remains strong in the country.
In October 2022, Li, the former Shanghai leader, was promoted to the country’s No. 2 spot. Musk is also building a battery factory in Shanghai, which a state-owned research firm said last year would use CATL cells. When Musk traveled to China last May, the battery maker’s chair welcomed him with a 16-course banquet. At his side for at least part of the trip was Tao, the lobbyist, who had risen to the post of vice president at Tesla. (CATL did not respond to questions.)
Even the plant Tesla is building in Nuevo León, Mexico, will use Chinese suppliers, several of whom the state governor has said will set up factories nearby.
Late last year, Musk attended an exclusive reception for Xi in San Francisco.
On Weibo, a Chinese social platform, Musk posted a photo of him shaking hands with the Chinese leader. “May there be prosperity for all,” he wrote.

Host City Gets High Rollers. Fans of 49ers Prefer Reno.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: With sports betting illegal in California and daunting prices in the Super Bowl host city, some San Francisco fans embraced an alternative.
Every Super Bowl Sunday, thousands of gamblers head to the Grand Sierra Resort and Casino, the largest of its kind in northern Nevada, to bet on the big game and party with fellow football fans. High rollers dine on all-you-can-eat buffets and the champagne flows in V.I.P. rooms throughout the massive complex. Long lines snake out of the William Hill Sportsbook just off the casino floor.
But the action this year was supercharged because the Super Bowl included the San Francisco 49ers, and many of the team's fans in California, where sports betting is still illegal, crossed the border into Nevada to lay down bets and celebrate with their brethren.
Some of the fans considered traveling to Las Vegas, where the Super Bowl was played for the first time this year. But they did not want to battle the crowds only to pay daunting prices for hotels and meals. Reno may lack the buzz of Las Vegas, they said, but the self-proclaimed Biggest Little City in the World had the benefit of being affordable and convenient, roughly a four-hour drive from the Bay Area.
"I could have gone to Vegas, but everything's hiked up there," said Daniel Burnett, a 49ers fan from San Francisco who stayed the weekend at the Grand Sierra. "Here, everything's in one place."
Everything, it seems, but a 49ers win. They fell to the Kansas City Chiefs in overtime, 25-22, leaving many San Francisco fans at the casino stunned, and a few in tears.
Still, it was like Nevada's Super Bowl overflow party with a decidedly more low-key vibe. The casino hotels in Reno do not have the fountains that grace the Bellagio on the Vegas Strip. Few people come here for midnight helicopter rides. What happens in Reno doesn't always stay in Reno. But for regulars like Jacob and Nicole Wood, two Raiders fans who drove four hours from Clearlake, Calif., Reno is just fine.
"No way I'm paying $ 11,000 for a ticket in Las Vegas," Mr. Wood said. He and his wife, who also bets on horseracing and basketball, have watched the Super Bowl in Reno for a dozen years.
In many ways, the Super Bowl highlighted anew the gap between Las Vegas and Reno. Las Vegas is an international entertainment capital known as the setting for movies like the "Ocean's" and "Hangover" franchises. After years of being shunned by professional sports leagues, the city is now home to the Stanley Cup champion Golden Knights and the Raiders of the N.F.L.
Reno? Many casinos have shut or merged. Downtown is pockmarked by open lots. Sports? There's a Triple A baseball franchise, the Aces, and the National Bowling Stadium.
And while Las Vegas continues to market extravagance and excess, Reno, which is less than one-quarter of the size, seems forever at a crossroads. The cities remain rivals, especially when they battle for funding in the state capital, Carson City, 30 minutes south of Reno. But when people think of Nevada, Las Vegas typically springs to mind.
"The North-South divide in Nevada is very ingrained and entrenched," said John L. Smith, a longtime journalist from Las Vegas who now lives in Reno. "The South was jealous of the North's power. The North was jealous of the South's pizazz and money and growth."
It may be hard to contemplate, but for many years Reno was Las Vegas before Las Vegas became Sin City. Founded in the 1860s as a railway hub, the city prospered during the silver and gold rushes. Reno became the divorce capital of America because couples were required to live here for only six months -- lowered in later years to six weeks -- before taking advantage of the state's liberal rules for splitting up.
As divorces flooded in, so did lawyers and bankers. Hotels, casinos and other entertainment establishments sprang up. After gambling was legalized statewide in 1931, new visitors arrived. Movies that flicked at the city's divorce industry were filmed in Reno, including "The Misfits," starring Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable.
But Reno has been a city of transients, and as other states adopted "no fault" divorce laws, one of the city's calling cards faded. By the 1950 census, Las Vegas had surpassed Reno as casinos went up on the Strip, drawing Hollywood entertainers and bigger crowds in southern Nevada.
Reno, named for a Civil War general who never stepped foot in Nevada, continues to search for a new identity. Starting in the 1980s, it was hit by a wave of casino closures and bankruptcies. The flow of gamblers coming here slowed after Native American casinos opened in California.
Motels and casinos have been knocked down to make way for redevelopment that has barely begun. Last year, an overhaul of the old Harrah's Reno hotel and casino stalled, leaving a giant eyesore. Many of the remaining casinos are windowless, self-contained bubbles that have turned the surrounding streets into uninviting walkways.
"Downtown is at war with itself, battling the needs of the casinos for parking and open space geared toward tourists versus residential mixed-use density," said Alicia Barber, a local historian and author of "Reno's Big Gamble: Image and Reputation in the Biggest Little City." "We're trying to establish a sense of place."
Things got so bad that analysts studying the city in 2010 wondered whether Reno could turn into the Detroit of the West by 2020. In December, Allegiant Airlines -- whose name is on the stadium where the Super Bowl was played -- said it would no longer fly in or out of Reno, leaving just two airlines offering nonstop flights between the city and Las Vegas.
In the past decade or so, Reno has pivoted. Apple, Tesla, Panasonic and other companies have opened facilities in the area, attracting Californians in search of tech jobs and cheaper homes. The city has marketed its easy access to world-class skiing and other outdoor pursuits near Lake Tahoe.
Reno still has plenty of casinos to draw gamblers from California, Idaho, Utah and other neighboring states where sports betting has not been legalized. None has done more to attract those visitors than the Grand Sierra, which has a movie theater, a bowling alley, night clubs, a 3,000-seat theater and a Charlie Palmer steakhouse.
Chris Abraham, the senior vice president of marketing at Grand Sierra, said the resort puts on Super Bowl parties every year, but visitors were up 10 percent this year because the 49ers were in the big game. About 1,600 guests packed a ballroom and dined on Kansas City barbecue, wings and nachos. Smaller groups paid up to $ 2,000 for a table in the Lex Nightclub.
"A lot of people looked at Las Vegas and said it was going to be ridiculous there, I can get the same kind of experience here," Mr. Abraham said.
As sports gambling has spread, the Grand Sierra and Reno have been offering people more reasons to visit. In 2022, the sports book was refurbished and a Chickie's & Pete's sports bar opened. The resort will invest about $ 1 billion into the 140-acre property over the next decade, including building a 10,000-seat arena.
But even with all that yet to come, Reno was still an oasis compared with Las Vegas for some fans this year.
"It feels good but extra good because the 49ers are in it," Deron Dow, who drove from San Francisco with his girlfriend, Martha Anaya, said before the game.
And it beat paying the prices and fighting the crowds in Las Vegas.
"Vegas would have been way worse," Mr. Dow said.

Nevada Is Placing Bets Away From Its Casinos: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Before the pandemic brought everyday life to a halt, Joe Kiele supported himself through the industry that dominates Nevada's economy. He waited tables at a steakhouse inside a casino in Reno.
Four years later, Mr. Kiele, 49, remains in Reno, yet he now spends his workday inside a factory. In place of worrying about the doneness of a customer's rib-eye, he trains people on the proper handling of industrial chemicals.
His employer, Redwood Materials, is constructing an enormous complex across a lonely stretch of desert. There, the company has begun recycling batteries harvested from discarded smartphones and other electronics. It extracts critical minerals like nickel, lithium, copper and cobalt, and uses them to manufacture components for electric vehicle batteries.
Not coincidentally, the plant sits only eight miles from a major customer -- a Tesla auto factory.
Mr. Kiele's shift from restaurant server to chemical operator parallels a transformation long championed by Nevada's leaders seeking to make their economy more diverse, reducing its reliance on the hospitality industry for jobs. In recent years, they have tried to secure investment from companies engaged in the transition toward green energy.
The Redwood Materials plant, which occupies roughly 300 acres and is expected to require some $ 2 billion in investment over the next decade, looms like a monument to Nevada's aspirations. For the employees, the factory is evidence that there are ways to pay bills besides dealing cards and delivering food.
"We're not based on consumerism," Mr. Kiele said. "We're dealing with industry."
This is not the first time that Nevada has sought to broaden its economy. The state has a history of betting its fate on the bounty flowing from a single industry.
In the years after the Civil War, the newly formed state was concentrated on mining silver and gold. Over the unfolding decades, Nevada's economy prospered and stumbled in line with the value of the ore extracted from its parched earth.
The legalization of gambling in 1931 -- an effort to overcome the Depression -- spurred the construction of casinos. Conventional wisdom had it that gambling was so irresistible that the business was effectively impervious to economic downturns. But that understanding came undone during the Great Recession about 15 years ago. Then the pandemic added urgency to the mission to diversify.
The most conspicuous result of that campaign is the emergence of Las Vegas as a hub in the national distribution system for e-commerce.
Nearly 14 million square feet of warehouse space is now being built in the Las Vegas metropolitan area, among 40 million square feet planned over the next two to three years -- an increase of nearly one-fourth of the existing capacity, said John Stater, research manager at Colliers, the commercial real estate investment management firm.
"We are building warehouse space at a pace I couldn't have imagined," he said.
The trend is propelled by geography. Las Vegas is threaded by Interstate 15, which runs from Southern California north to Salt Lake City. Smaller highways link Las Vegas to Interstate 10, which runs between Los Angeles and Phoenix. Some 39 million people live within a half-day's drive.
During the chaos of the pandemic, factory goods from Asia overwhelmed the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Southern California's warehouses seized with dysfunction -- a cause of delays in the American delivery system for goods. That encouraged retailers to seek out alternative places to stash their wares.
Las Vegas beckoned with large developable lots. Most of the new warehouses are going up on the fringes of the metropolitan area, in North Las Vegas, on scrub-covered desert rolling out to treeless mountains.
There, Prologis, a San Francisco real estate investment trust, is aggressively building, while recently buying an undeveloped expanse of 900 acres.
Only a few years ago, Prologis executives were excited to put up warehouses stretching across 200,000 square feet, leasing them to major brands. On a recent afternoon, bulldozers moved earth at a soon-to-be-completed 680,000-square-foot warehouse for Moen, the maker of kitchen and bathroom fixtures.
"We're very bullish on continued growth," said Lisa Brady, a vice president at Prologis.
Crocs, the footwear company, is preparing to open a distribution center in a new warehouse running one million square feet. There, some 400 initial workers earning starting pay of $ 18 an hour will begin handling orders.
More than 93,000 people work in transportation and warehousing in the state, an increase of one-fifth since before the pandemic, according to data analyzed by David Schmidt, chief economist at the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. That compares with 364,000 jobs in leisure and hospitality.
Some economists argue that warehouses are a dubious alternative to casino work, given that many people burn out after only a few years, while pay tends to be lower. But the Nevada Governor's Office of Economic Development, which courts investment, argues that entry-level work can lead to supervisory positions that pay far more than typical jobs in leisure and hospitality.
"I see this as a springboard to the future," said Bob Potts, the agency's deputy director.
A longer-term goal focuses on replicating the entrepreneurial pursuits of people like Martin Schiller, founder and chief executive of a biotechnology venture called Heligenics.
Dr. Schiller's résumé included a teaching stint at Johns Hopkins when he arrived 14 years ago to start a medical institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In a lab there, he pioneered a way to fine-tune existing drugs by bombarding them with tens of thousands of genetic mutations, gleaning how cells develop resistance.
"We're drug hackers," Dr. Schiller said.
On a recent afternoon, he and his team assessed data gleaned from a trial of a variety of interferon used to treat multiple sclerosis, as they moved toward seeking the Food and Drug Administration's approval for a new therapy.
At first, Las Vegas felt isolated, but then Dr. Schiller came to appreciate some advantages. The university gave him time to develop his technique and launch his business, free of the publish-or-perish culture that rules much of academia. The city leased him space in a museum to establish his first lab. He constructed his current offices and laboratory with a shoestring budget of $ 4 million.
"In San Francisco, that would take $ 20 million," he said.
Reno has long operated in the shadow of Las Vegas, but in recent times the city has prospered through reinvention. The Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center has become a showcase, anchored by the Tesla factory and a Panasonic plant that makes electric vehicle batteries.
Redwood Materials, which was started by a Tesla co-founder, J.B. Straubel, began producing at a limited scale in late 2022. The company employs 661 people at the Nevada site, with a target of 1,600 jobs by the end of the decade.
Redwood's liaison with state and local government is Don Tatro, a former state senator whose grandfather ran the Carson City Nugget, a casino south of Reno. Many of the new hires have experience in leisure and hospitality. Their new work -- creating parts for electric vehicles -- comes with a sense of mission.
"There's a lot of security in it," said Grace Uhart, 27, who started her career in the front office of the Venetian resort in Las Vegas and now supervises janitorial and culinary services at Redwood. "The business that we're in was going to need to be figured out."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The leading U.S. electric-vehicle maker also drew buyers eager to take advantage of government incentives that will be harder to get in 2024.
Tesla sales jumped during the last three months of 2023 after the carmaker slashed prices and customers rushed to take advantage of tax breaks on electric vehicles -- provisions that will be harder to come by in 2024.
The company said on Tuesday that it sold 484,500 cars in the fourth quarter, up from 435,000 in the third quarter and 405,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, Tesla sold 1.8 million vehicles. The gains put Tesla on track to sell more than two million cars in 2024, potentially overtaking established carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and Renault.
The rebound in sales during the fourth quarter should help calm investor concerns about whether Tesla can defend its dominance of the market for electric vehicles as it faces increased competition from traditional carmakers.
During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles. Tesla accounts for half the electric cars sold in the United States. In 2022, Tesla accounted for two-thirds of the market.
Another electric vehicle maker, Rivian, said on Tuesday that it sold nearly 14,000 vehicles in the last three months of the year. That number was up substantially from a year earlier but down about 10 percent from the third quarter.
In China, the largest market for electric cars, Tesla faces intense competition from BYD and other Chinese automakers. BYD sold 526,000 fully electric cars worldwide in the fourth quarter, exceeding Tesla, a milestone that many auto analysts had been expecting given the Chinese company's rapid growth.
Chinese automakers have moved faster in offering a wide range of affordable electric models as the market has expanded beyond the affluent early adopters of technology. They are the core customers who have bought Teslas for as long as the company has been around.
"The customers who are buying E.V.s now are second adopters, who have fundamentally different needs," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund focused on investing in sustainable transportation. "They care about tangible and immediately realizable decreases in total cost of ownership, and they care about convenience."
In Europe, Volkswagen and its Audi and Skoda divisions sell more electric vehicles than Tesla, although the Tesla Model Y is by far the best-selling model on the continent, according to data compiled by Schmidt Automotive Research.
In the United States, people interested in buying an electric car had a strong incentive to take delivery before the end of the year because of new rules intended to cut China out of the supply chain.
Tesla had warned on its website that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would no longer qualify for $ 7,500 federal tax credits after Dec. 31. The cars have batteries made in China. Germany and some other European countries have also rolled back subsidies for electric vehicle buyers.
To maintain sales, Tesla cut prices, offering Model 3s on its website for well under $ 30,000 after factoring in the tax credits. By late December, the number of lower-priced cars listed on the website appeared to have dwindled, suggesting that the strategy had succeeded. But the price reductions cut into Tesla profits, which fell 44 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.
Tesla said it would announce earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 on Jan. 24.
While fewer Teslas will qualify for federal tax credits in 2024, the company is in a better position than most of its competitors. The Performance version of the Model 3, which includes upgraded wheels and brakes, will remain eligible for the subsidy, as will all versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle, according to a federal government website. Tesla makes batteries for those cars at a Nevada plant operated with Panasonic, allowing it to meet domestic manufacturing requirements.
That gives Tesla a significant advantage over competitors like Ford, which has said that its Mustang Mach-E sport utility vehicle will not qualify for the credit in the new year.
Ford and others rely on manufacturers in China for crucial components. Ford is building battery factories in the United States, but they will not begin producing until 2025.
General Motors has been building batteries at a new factory in Ohio, but has struggled to get the plant operating at full capacity. Initially only the Chevrolet Bolt will qualify for tax credits, G.M. said in December. The Cadillac Lyriq and electric Chevrolet Blazer will no longer be eligible.
G.M. has said it is adjusting its supply chain so that those and other vehicles, including electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Equinox sport utility vehicle, will become eligible early in the year.
Tesla and other carmakers may also benefit from lower interest rates in the new year. Investors are betting that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will start to ratchet down rates as inflation cools.

Can an Industrial Heartland That's Slowing, Graying and in Debt Be Revived?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: China, facing an economic slump, wants to make its industrial northeast more productive, turning to policies that some economists say have outlived their time.
Hundreds of workers at a factory in Shenyang in northeastern China weld automated machines, 95 yards long, that are used to bore subway tunnels. At another factory there, employees assemble robots that China's solar panel makers will use to streamline their production.
Shenyang is the capital of Liaoning Province, one of three large provinces in the northeast that constitute the cradle of China's heavy industry. Now the central government, confronting a national economy that has slowed because of a real estate crisis that defies easy fixes, is turning to cities like Shenyang. It hopes to squeeze more productivity and efficiency out of the region's factories.
But those factories tell only part of the story of the economy of northeastern China, underlining the challenges facing Beijing policymakers, who are turning to what many economists believe is a tired playbook focused on industrial investments instead of more social benefits for consumers.
The region's birthrate is plummeting: A quarter of the population is 65 or older, and that share is growing about two percentage points a year, while the share of working-age adults is declining by about the same amount. Fewer people are buying new homes, apartment prices are falling and construction cranes are less active.
Northeastern China is like the Michigan and Ohio of Chinese manufacturing, but with a population considerably grayer than Florida's. In many ways, the region is a composite of the most deeply embedded problems facing the country's economy.
The area is heavily in debt. Public revenues are slumping because of the real estate bust. Pensions are the responsibility of the region's three provincial governments -- Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang -- and their cost is soaring.
On a recent evening, Zhang Shaocheng, 70, a retiree from a state-owned paint factory, waited with other seniors for a free outdoor movie at a shuttered Shenyang machinery factory. He appreciates that today's factories emit less pollution than the ones from his working years, but he and other seniors are counting on the government to take care of them.
"The air is good now, and I have a pension," Mr. Zhang said.
As the Chinese economy has slowed this year, the northeast is perilously close to tipping into a recession. Making sure that the economy of China's industrial heartland can keep growing and support a rising pension burden, as well as produce more exports, has become a top priority in Beijing.
In early September, when heads of state gathered for the Group of 20 summit in New Delhi, China's top leader, Xi Jinping, stayed home and traveled to northeastern China.
The region holds strategic importance. It encompasses sensitive regions abutting North Korea and Russia. It is home to much of China's armaments industry, first built with Soviet advisers in the 1950s. It is China's main producer of grain and crude oil. And it has been a bastion of China's Communist Party since the 1940s and a hub of often strident nationalism.
Mr. Xi called for quick action. What has emerged after the trip, and from media briefings in Liaoning arranged by the national government, is a plan largely focused on more public investment, a longtime theme of Beijing's policies. A notable aspect of the program involves digital technology, steps like upgrading car factories with robots.
What's missing from it are measures that could boost consumer confidence, such as expanded unemployment benefits and pensions, or direct payments to households to stimulate spending. Such steps have been absent from measures undertaken so far to try to help the national economy.
The biggest step taken so far to increase demand for goods from the northeast is also the measure most likely to upset the West: selling more to Russia. Chinese automakers have captured half the car market there, for example, after Western rivals pulled out last year following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"The northeast is an important gateway for our country to open to the north," Mr. Xi declared during his visit to Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang.
In many ways, China's northeast is a natural target for economic stimulus based on public investment. In other parts of the country, many young job seekers shun factory jobs, seeking office work for even half the pay. But the northeast still has many multigenerational families of technicians.
"In the northeast, the manufacturing culture is strong," said Li Kai, an economist at Northeastern University in Shenyang.
The region's iron ore mines, steel mills and machinery factories are little affected by trade issues like the United States' restrictions on superfast semiconductors. A factory in Shenyang that makes car seats for Germany's BMW, for example, imports a less advanced semiconductor from Italy to manage the seat's complex movements.
"It is not a high-end chip, so there is no impact," said Kou Chuang, the business manager at the factory, which is owned by two Chinese auto parts manufacturers, Jinbei and Yanfeng.
Shenyang has also joined a recent national move by Chinese cities to ease mortgage rules. Home buyers now can qualify for the same discounted interest rate given to first-time buyers, even if they previously owned a home and already paid off its mortgage.
The northeast is home to many state-owned enterprises, some of which have sought greater efficiency by gradually shifting to partial private ownership.
Northern Heavy Industries in Shenyang, which has expanded rapidly since the 1950s, underwent a corporate overhaul in 2013. Today, Fangda Group, a privately held Liaoning conglomerate, holds a majority stake. Bingshan Group, a refrigeration equipment giant in Liaoning, is one-third owned by the municipal government of Dalian, where it has its headquarters, but has sold a small stake to Panasonic of Japan.
To stabilize consumer spending in the region, the government is investing in building culture-themed shopping plazas and museums that might prompt residents and tourists to spend money.
Officials in Liaoning have stepped up spending on cultural institutions like the Liaoning Ballet Troupe, which had 30 performances in 2022 and already more than 40 this year.
The company recently performed an original composition, "Iron Man," about industrial workers in the 1950s, hoping to attract the province's many seniors while trying to draw a younger audience as well.
"We want the young people to know what their fathers have done," said Qu Zijiao, the ballet's director.
Summer tourism has picked up after the lifting of Covid controls in December. Cool weather made the northeast a popular destination as other parts of China baked in scorching temperatures.
Sue Sui, 50, an accountant from Beijing, sat on the beach in Dalian on a mid-September afternoon. She said she had not been able to visit in midsummer because every affordable hotel had been fully booked.
"There is revenge tourism spending," she said.
Yet weaknesses in consumer spending persist. Retail sales per person in Liaoning Province are just a third of the level in Beijing or Shanghai and half what they are in vibrant provinces in southeastern China.
There was almost nowhere to spend money at the well-preserved brick factory buildings where Mr. Zhang, the retiree, and others attended the outdoor movie. A small coffee shop was hidden behind a windowless door in a distant, unlit corner with no signage.
It was almost empty on the night of the movie.

It's a Surprisingly Speedy Shift: [SpecialSections]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The United States is pivoting away from fossil fuels and toward wind, solar and other renewable energy, even in areas dominated by the oil and gas industries.
Delivery vans in Pittsburgh. Buses in Milwaukee. Cranes loading freight at the Port of Los Angeles. Every municipal building in Houston. All are powered by electricity derived from the sun, wind or other sources of clean energy.
Across the country, a profound shift is taking place that is nearly invisible to most Americans. The nation that burned coal, oil and gas for more than a century to become the richest economy on the planet, as well as historically the most polluting, is rapidly shifting away from fossil fuels.
A similar energy transition is already well underway in Europe and elsewhere. But the United States is catching up, and globally, change is happening at a pace that is surprising even the experts who track it closely.
Wind and solar power are breaking records, and renewables are now expected to overtake coal by 2025 as the world's largest source of electricity. Automakers have made electric vehicles central to their business strategies and are openly talking about an expiration date on the internal combustion engine. Heating, cooling, cooking and some manufacturing are going electric.
As the planet registers the highest temperatures on record, rising in some places to levels incompatible with human life, governments around the world are pouring trillions of dollars into clean energy to cut the carbon pollution that is broiling the planet.
The cost of generating electricity from the sun and wind is falling fast and in many areas is now cheaper than gas, oil or coal. Private investment is flooding into companies that are jockeying for advantage in emerging green industries.
"We look at energy data on a daily basis, and it's astonishing what's happening," said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. "Clean energy is moving faster than many people think, and it's become turbocharged lately."
More than $ 1.7 trillion worldwide is expected to be invested in technologies such as wind, solar power, electric vehicles and batteries globally this year, according to the I.E.A., compared with just over $ 1 trillion in fossil fuels. That is by far the most ever spent on clean energy in a year.
Those investments are driving explosive growth. China, which already leads the world in the sheer amount of electricity produced by wind and solar power, is expected to double its capacity by 2025, five years ahead of schedule. In Britain, roughly one-third of electricity is generated by wind, solar and hydropower. And in the United States, 23 percent of electricity is expected to come from renewable sources this year, up 10 percentage points from a decade ago.
"The nature of these exponential curves sometimes causes us to underestimate how quickly changes occur once they reach these inflection points and begin accelerating," said former Vice President Al Gore, who called attention to what he termed a "planetary crisis" 17 years ago in his film "An Inconvenient Truth." "The trend is definitely in favor of more and more renewable energy and less fossil energy."
Even as the pace of change in the United States is surprising everyone from energy experts to automobile executives, fossil fuels still dominate energy production at home and abroad.
Corporations are building new coal mines, oil rigs and gas pipelines. The government continues to award leases for drilling projects on public lands and in federal waters and still subsidizes the industries. After posting record profits last year, leading oil companies are backing away from recent promises to invest more heavily in renewable energy.
The scale of change required to remake the systems that power the United States -- all the infrastructure that needs to be removed, re-engineered and replaced -- is mind-boggling. There are major challenges involved in adding large amounts of renewable energy to antiquated electric grids and mining enough minerals for clean technologies. Some politicians, including most Republicans, want the country to continue burning fossil fuels, even in the face of overwhelming scientific consensus that their use is endangering life on the planet. Dozens of conservative groups organized by the Heritage Foundation have created a policy playbook, should a Republican win the 2024 presidential election, that would reverse course on lowering emissions. It would shred regulations designed to curb greenhouse gases, dismantle nearly every federal clean energy program and boost the production of fossil fuels.
And while energy systems are changing fast, so is the climate. It is far from certain whether the United States and other polluting countries will do what scientists say is required to avert catastrophe: stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2050. All of the investment so far has slowed the pace at which emissions are growing worldwide, but the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere is at record levels.
And yet, from Beijing to London, Tokyo to Washington, Oslo to Dubai, the energy transition is undeniably racing ahead. Change is here, even in oil country.
'Energy Is Energy'
As the workday begins in Tulsa, Okla., the assembly line at the electric school bus factory rattles to life. Crews fan out across the city to install solar panels on century-old Tudor homes. Teslas and Ford F-150 Lightnings pull up to charging stations powered in part by the country's second-largest wind farm. And at the University of Tulsa's School of Petroleum Engineering, faculty are working on ways to use hydrogen as a clean energy source.
Tulsa, a former boomtown once known as the "Oil Capital of the World" where the minor league baseball team is the Drillers, is immersed in a new energy revolution.
At the port, an Italian company, Enel, is building a $ 1 billion solar panel factory. The bus factory is operated by Navistar, one of the biggest commercial vehicle makers in the world. And the city's main electric utility, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, now harvests more than 28 percent of its power from wind.
Clean energy entrepreneurs are flocking to Oklahoma, too. Francis Energy, a fast-growing maker of electric vehicle charging stations, is based in Tulsa. Canoo, an electric vehicle start-up, is building a 100,000-square-foot battery factory at a nearby industrial park and a manufacturing plant for its trucks in Oklahoma City, though there are questions about whether the company will have enough funding to realize its plans. And teams from Solar Power of Oklahoma are busy fastening photovoltaic panels to the roofs of homes and businesses around Tulsa.
The city is embracing its shifting identity.
"We have a tremendous sense of pride in our history," said Dewey F. Bartlett Jr., the Republican former mayor of Tulsa who was an oil and gas executive but now helps recruit clean energy companies to the region. "But we also understand that energy is energy, whether it is generated by wind, steam or whatever it might be."
Around the country, clean energy is taking root in unlikely locales.
Houston, home to more than 500 oil and gas companies, also has more than 130 solar- and wind-related companies. Some of the country's largest wind and solar farms are in the Texas flatlands outside the city, and a huge wind farm has been proposed off the coast of Galveston.
In Arkansas, a planned solar farm -- the state's biggest -- is expected to help power a nearby U.S. Steel factory that is undergoing a $ 3 billion upgrade. When complete, the plant will use electric furnaces to mold scrap steel into new products. That will result in about 80 percent less greenhouse gases, the company says, and set the pace for an industry that has been a major polluter.
About two-thirds of the new investment in clean energy is in Republican-controlled states, where policymakers have historically resisted renewables. But with each passing month, the politics seem to matter less than the economics.
"We're the reddest state in the country, and we're an oil and gas state," said J.W. Peters, president of Solar Power of Oklahoma. "So it took a lot of time to convince people that this wasn't snake oil."
Mr. Peters was broke six years ago, with less than $ 400 in his checking account after his contracting business slowed down. Then he responded to a help-wanted ad looking for workers to install solar panels, which were becoming more popular in Tulsa. He now employs 61 workers and has $ 18 million in annual sales. "The environmental benefits are nice," he said, "but most people are doing this for the financial opportunity."
'Something Very Dramatic'
Fifteen years ago, solar panels, wind turbines and battery-powered vehicles were widely viewed as niche technologies, too expensive and unreliable for mainstream use.
But clean energy became cheap far faster than anyone expected. Since 2009, the cost of solar power has plunged by 83 percent, while the cost of producing wind power has fallen by more than half. The price of lithium-ion battery cells fell 97 percent over the past three decades.
Today, solar and wind power are the least expensive new sources of electricity in many markets, generating 12 percent of global electricity and rising. This year, for the first time, global investors are expected to pour more money into solar power -- some $ 380 billion -- than into drilling for oil.
The rapid drop in costs for solar energy, wind power and batteries can be traced to early government investment and steady improvements over time by hundreds of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs around the world.
"The world has produced nearly three billion solar panels at this point, and every one of those has been an opportunity for people to try to improve the process," said Gregory Nemet, a solar power expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "And all of those incremental improvements add up to something very dramatic."
An equally potent force, along with the technological advances, has been an influx of money -- in particular, a gusher since 2020 of government subsidies.
In the United States, President Biden signed a trio of laws during his first two years in office that allocated unprecedented funds for clean energy: A $ 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law provided money to enhance the power grid, buy electric buses for schools and build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act set aside billions of dollars for semiconductors vital to car manufacturing. And the Inflation Reduction Act, which marks its first anniversary on Aug. 16, is by far the most ambitious attempt to fight climate change in American history.
That landmark law provided tax breaks related to electric vehicles, heat pumps and energy efficiency upgrades, solar panel and wind turbine manufacturing and clean hydrogen production. The government is also investing in efforts to capture carbon emissions and store them before they can reach the atmosphere, as well as technology that can remove them directly from the air.
Originally estimated to cost roughly $ 391 billion between 2022 and 2031, the tax breaks are proving so popular with manufacturers and consumers that estimates now put the cost as high as $ 1.2 trillion over the next decade.
Combined, the three laws have prompted companies to announce at least $ 230 billion in manufacturing investments so far. In Georgia, a Korean solar manufacturer, Qcells, is building a $ 2.5 billion plant. In Nevada, Tesla is building a new $ 3.6 billion electric truck factory. And in Oklahoma, the Enel and Canoo facilities are primed to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, as is a new $ 4.4 billion battery factory being considered by Panasonic, the Japanese conglomerate.
"There's a lot of appetite to invest in the United States thanks to that law," said Giovanni Bertolino, an executive at Enel, adding that the plant his company is building in Tulsa would not exist without the Inflation Reduction Act.
Regulations are also hastening the energy transition. Mr. Biden has proposed tough new federal pollution limits on tailpipes and smokestacks, but several states are acting on their own. California, with market muscle that influences the entire auto industry, plans to halt sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and new diesel-powered trucks by 2036 -- and a handful of states are following suit. In May, New York became the first state to ban gas hookups in most new buildings, requiring all-electric heating and cooking starting in 2026. Several cities, including New York and San Francisco, have similar prohibitions, although some Republican-controlled states have blocked their municipalities from banning gas.
Heavy investment by the United States has spurred a spirited reaction from other wealthy nations. Countries that initially complained that the United States was unfairly subsidizing clean energy manufacturers have since engaged in a sort of friendly subsidy race.
Canada, South Korea and others have pushed for their companies to have better access to the American incentives, while offering similar subsidies to their domestic manufacturers. After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, the European Union moved to lessen its dependence on Russian oil and gas. In May, for the first time ever, wind and solar power in the E.U. generated more electricity than fossil fuels.
And in China, which is currently both the world's top polluter and the global leader for renewable power, the government continues to invest in every stage of clean energy production, from solar cells to batteries, wind turbines and more. Like the United States, China provides subsidies to buyers of electric vehicles. Last year it spent $ 546 billion on clean energy, far more than any other country in the world.
With costs falling fast, manufacturing has picked up and installations of solar and wind projects have increased. The U.S. solar industry installed a record 6.1 gigawatts of capacity in the first quarter of 2023, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year.
And those low costs have led many of the United States' biggest corporations, such as Alphabet, Amazon and General Motors, to purchase large amounts of wind and solar power, because it burnishes their reputations and because it makes good economic sense.
"We're seeing the nonlinear change happen before us," said Jon Creyts, chief executive of RMI, a nonprofit organization that promotes the energy transition. "And that's important, because we're facing a climate crisis right now."
'A National Phenomenon'
Steve Uerling's Tulsa home is a model of energy efficiency. He replaced all his incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. He installed a heat pump and rooftop solar panels this year. And he drives a plug-in hybrid Ford Fusion and a Tesla Model 3.
Mr. Uerling, a mechanical engineer, said he wanted to see renewable power take off in Oklahoma and was trying to do his part. But he was also driven by his wallet.
"My fuel cost is equivalent to getting 200 miles a gallon on gasoline," he said. "We charge at night, when we get a much cheaper rate on our electricity."
Millions of people around the country are making similar calculations. Electric vehicles are by far the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, with record sales of 300,000 in the second quarter of 2023, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier. Teslas are now among the best-selling cars in the country, and Ford has expanded its production of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of its popular pickup truck, after a surge of initial demand created a waiting list.
Concerns among consumers about the availability of charging stations as well as the cost of some models have helped to cool sales somewhat, leading some automakers to slash prices. Still, federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 have made the least expensive electric vehicles competitive with gas-powered cars. And about two dozen states offer additional tax credits, rebates or reduced fees, further pushing down their cost.
Government action is also helping heavier vehicles go electric. Sales of electric school buses are soaring, largely because of $ 5 billion in federal grants that can cover 100 percent of the cost for low-income communities. The Postal Service plans to spend nearly $ 10 billion to purchase 66,000 electric mail trucks -- roughly 30 percent of its fleet -- over the next five years.
In the private sector, Amazon has ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from Rivian. Tesla has an electric semitruck, as do several other manufacturers, including Peterbilt.
Companies that provide charging stations are springing up to meet the demand. Francis Energy has more than 400 chargers across Oklahoma and is expanding nationwide. EVgo, which has one of the largest fast-charging networks in the United States, plans to more than double the 3,000 charging stalls it operates.
"It is not a red-state, blue-state thing," said Cathy Zoi, EVgo's chief executive. "It is a national phenomenon."
In an unusual move, seven carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- are spending $ 1 billion in a joint venture to build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The shift is happening so quickly that some of America's most iconic automakers are preparing for a world beyond gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
General Motors, which has the largest market share of any carmaker in the United States, has committed to selling only zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. It's a "once-in-a-generation inflection point" for the 114-year-old automaker, according to Mary Barra, G.M.'s chief executive.
In an interview, Ms. Barra said her company began to consider an all-electric future in 2020. "We started to see this happening with the consumer research we did," said Ms. Barra, who has subsequently bet billions on G.M.'s efforts to reorient its engineering, overhaul its manufacturing facilities and processes and build new battery plants.
As the cost of batteries comes down, and the number of charging stations nationwide goes up, Ms. Barra expects exponential growth. "I think it's going to be definitely an upward trajectory," she said. "It'll be a little bumpy, but bumpy growing."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amazon, Box, Salesforce, Oracle and others have recently rolled out A.I.-related products to help workplaces become more efficient and productive.
Earlier this year, Mark Austin, the vice president of data science at AT&T, noticed that some of the company's developers had started using the ChatGPT chatbot at work. When the developers got stuck, they asked ChatGPT to explain, fix or hone their code.
It seemed to be a game-changer, Mr. Austin said. But since ChatGPT is a publicly available tool, he wondered if it was secure for businesses to use.
So in January, AT&T tried a product from Microsoft called Azure OpenAI Services that lets businesses build their own A.I.-powered chatbots. AT&T used it to create a proprietary A.I. assistant, Ask AT&T, which helps its developers automate their coding process. AT&T's customer service representatives also began using the chatbot to help summarize their calls, among other tasks.
"Once they realize what it can do, they love it," Mr. Austin said. Forms that once took hours to complete needed only two minutes with Ask AT&T so employees could focus on more complicated tasks, he said, and developers who used the chatbot increased their productivity by 20 to 50 percent.
AT&T is one of many businesses eager to find ways to tap the power of generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers chatbots and that has gripped Silicon Valley with excitement in recent months. Generative A.I. can produce its own text, photos and video in response to prompts, capabilities that can help automate tasks such as taking meeting minutes and cut down on paperwork.
To meet this new demand, tech companies are racing to introduce products for businesses that incorporate generative A.I. Over the past three months, Amazon, Box and Cisco have unveiled plans for generative A.I.-powered products that produce code, analyze documents and summarize meetings. Salesforce also recently rolled out generative A.I. products used in sales, marketing and its Slack messaging service, while Oracle announced a new A.I. feature for human resources teams.
These companies are also investing more in A.I. development. In May, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures, the venture capital arm of Salesforce, invested in Cohere, a Toronto start-up focused on generative A.I. for business use. Oracle is also reselling Cohere's technology.
"I think this is a complete breakthrough in enterprise software," Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, said of generative A.I. He called it "this incredibly exciting opportunity where, for the first time ever, you can actually start to understand what's inside of your data in a way that wasn't possible before."
Many of these tech companies are following Microsoft, which has invested $ 13 billion in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. In January, Microsoft made Azure OpenAI Service available to customers, who can then access OpenAI's technology to build their own versions of ChatGPT. As of May, the service had 4,500 customers, said John Montgomery, a Microsoft corporate vice president.
For the most part, tech companies are now rolling out four kinds of generative A.I. products for businesses: features and services that generate code for software engineers, create new content such as sales emails and product descriptions for marketing teams, search company data to answer employee questions, and summarize meeting notes and lengthy documents.
"It is going to be a tool that is used by people to accomplish what they are already doing," said Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at the I.T. research and consulting firm Gartner.
But using generative A.I. in workplaces has risks. Chatbots can produce inaccuracies and misinformation, provide inappropriate responses and leak data. A.I. remains largely unregulated.
In response to these issues, tech companies have taken some steps. To prevent data leakage and to enhance security, some have engineered generative A.I. products so they do not keep a customer's data.
When Salesforce last month introduced AI Cloud, a service with nine generative A.I.-powered products for businesses, the company included a "trust layer" to help mask sensitive corporate information to stop leaks and promised that what users typed into these products would not be used to retrain the underlying A.I. model.
Similarly, Oracle said that customer data would be kept in a secure environment while training its A.I. model and added that it would not be able to see the information.
Salesforce offers AI Cloud starting at $ 360,000 annually, with the cost rising depending on the amount of usage. Microsoft charges for Azure OpenAI Service based on the version of OpenAI technology that a customer chooses, as well as the amount of usage.
For now, generative A.I. is used mainly in workplace scenarios that carry low risks -- instead of highly regulated industries -- with a human in the loop, said Beena Ammanath, the executive director of the Deloitte A.I. Institute, a research center of the consulting firm. A recent Gartner survey of 43 companies found that over half the respondents have no internal policy on generative A.I.
"It is not just about being able to use these new tools efficiently, but it is also about preparing your work force for the new kinds of work that might evolve," Ms. Ammanath said. "There is going to be new skills needed."
Panasonic Connect, part of the Japanese electronics company Panasonic, began using Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service to make its own chatbot in February. Today, its employees ask the chatbot 5,000 questions a day about everything from drafting emails to writing code.
While Panasonic Connect had expected its engineers to be the main users of the chatbot, other departments -- such as legal, accounting and quality assurance -- also turned to it to help summarize legal documents, brainstorm solutions to improve product quality and other tasks, said Judah Reynolds, Panasonic Connect's marketing and communications chief.
"Everyone started using it in ways that we didn't even foresee ourselves," he said. "So people are really taking advantage of it."

SAN FRANCISCO — Earlier this year, Mark Austin, the vice president of data science at AT&T, noticed that some of the company’s developers had started using the ChatGPT chatbot at work. When the developers got stuck, they asked ChatGPT to explain, fix or hone their code.

Panasonic Plans to Delay Making a Battery for Tesla
Panasonic said on Wednesday that it would delay the commercial production of its 4680 battery cells until next year as the company aims to improve their performance.
Panasonic, which will provide the battery to Tesla, had previously planned to start volume production as early as last month.
Panasonic is running a pilot 4680 production line at its Wakayama factory in Japan, while Tesla is already producing the 4680 battery cells, which its chief, Elon Musk, has touted as being key to making cheaper and compelling electric cars. But the carmaker struggled to meet its targets for production and performance of the cells.
Tesla's South Korean supplier LG Energy Solution said last month that it planned to set up a new 4680 production line at its domestic factory by the end of this year, but did not say when the batteries would start volume production. REUTERS
LABOR PRACTICES
VW Shareholder Meeting Is Disrupted by Protests
Volkswagen's annual shareholder meeting was briefly disrupted Wednesday by protests over the company's factory in China's Xinjiang province, with a shouting, topless activist interrupting the speech by the chief executive, Oliver Blume, before she was hustled away by security personnel.
Additionally a cakelike object was thrown during a speech by the board chairman, Hans-Dieter Poetsch, apparently in the direction of another board member, Wolfgang Porsche, who represents his family's shareholding in the company.
Photos showed a white, gooey substance resembling pastry stuck to the front of the dais behind which Mr. Porsche was sitting.
Volkswagen has said that it has found no evidence of human rights violations at its Xinjiang plant. The Chinese government has been accused of human rights abuses against its Muslim Uyghur population, including forced labor in detention camps. The U.S. State Department has described China's actions in the region as genocide. ASSOCIATED PRESS
CLIMATE LITIGATION
Greenpeace Suit Targets Italian Energy Company
Greenpeace and an environmental coalition including 12 Italian citizens are suing the Italian energy company ENI, accusing it of knowingly contributing to climate change.
The complaint names ENI and its two biggest shareholders, the Italian Economy Ministry and the Italian state lender and public investment bank, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. It is seeking past and future damages as a result of "climate change to which ENI has significantly contributed by its conduct in recent decades, while being aware of it," according to a statement from Greenpeace Italy.
In a statement, ENI said it would demonstrate in court the "groundlessness" of the lawsuit and the "correctness" of its decarbonization strategy, which it said balanced sustainability, energy security and competitiveness.
ENI said it would consider legal action on its own against one of the plaintiffs, ReCommon, claiming defamation. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: Tim Cook, the chief executive of the iPhone maker, visited Mumbai to inaugurate the store. Apple is pushing to expand its market share in India, as well as shift some production there.
Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, visited India this week to open the company's first two Apple stores there: The biggest public company in the world is finally opening its first retail outlets in the world's most populous country.
Roaring crowds of would-be customers greeted him in Mumbai on Tuesday at a sleek glass-and-timber flatiron of a storefront, called Apple BKC, in the Bandra Kurla Complex. On Thursday, Mr. Cook will travel to New Delhi to open a second store, Apple Saket, at the center of the capital's biggest mall.
The Apple brand is not new to India. But for the past 25 years -- marked this week, in fact -- Apple has relied solely on third-party sellers to get its products into the hands of Indian consumers. The iPhone is still a rare sight within the ocean of cheaper, and mostly Chinese-branded, Android smartphones that have swept across India over the past decade. Yet in India, as in nearly every other part of the world, Apple has its fans. Some of the most ardent were at the Mumbai opening, screaming their support.
And in Delhi are eager customers like Amar Bhasin, 41, whose first cellphone, bought 18 years ago, was a Panasonic. More recently, he bought an iPad from an Indian outlet, only to discover that its screen was cracked. The store refused to exchange it, and local service centers weren't helpful. So Mr. Bhasin addressed a letter to Mr. Cook himself -- and a month later, a new iPad appeared in the mail.
"I felt so good, and became an Apple fan instantly -- who does that?" Mr. Bhasin said, standing before the still-shrouded Apple Saket. "I don't see myself buying another brand in the foreseeable future."
India is an important frontier for Apple. It was by far the biggest country to lack an outlet bearing its own brand. Some much smaller countries have multiple Apple stores: Switzerland has four, and even Macau, a Chinese territory with a population of 680,000, or 0.5 percent of India's, has two.
But those countries are something India is not: rich. Even the lower- to middle-income countries with Apple stores, such as Brazil, Thailand and Turkey, have per-capita incomes several times higher than India's.
In a potential market so big, Apple does not need to make much of a dent to earn back its investment. The company's market share in India has been growing rapidly. The iPhone 13 is the best-selling model in the premium segment, which includes phones that cost above 30,000 rupees, or $ 365. Last year, only 11 percent of the market was considered premium, but it was the fastest-growing segment.
The Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi sold the most phones in total, and the South Korean giant Samsung, which competes at different price points, had the highest value of sales, according to Counterpoint Research.
But Apple faces a consumer-pricing puzzle in India. Unlike a McDonald's, for example, Apple's signature products need to sell for roughly the same price everywhere (or else they would fly around the world, unlocked, on the black market). But the difference between marketing utility goods and luxury products becomes jumbled in the Indian context. In the Saket mall, called Select CityWalk, a bubble of air-conditioning and chromed shopfronts are across the road from a medieval warren; the Apple store is opposite a Krispy Kreme. Outposts of Chanel and Van Heusen are nearby.
Price hits differently in a country where the top 10 percent income bracket begins at 25,000 rupees, or $ 304, per month -- well under half the cost of a new iPhone. For many millions of wealthy Indians, that is perfectly acceptable. And even for those whom it stretches, it can be a price worth paying.
"It's simple: For me, it's a status symbol," said Subodh Sharma, who earns exactly 25,000 rupees per month working for a construction company. "The message that goes out to the peer and society is that, look, this person is not totally third-class," he said, glancing down at the iPhone tucked into his shirt pocket.
Mr. Sharma's partner, Bhawana, however, disagrees with his assessment. An iPhone is "not worth it," she said, right after Mr. Sharma took her photo in front of the store in Delhi. "It's uselessly costly, and its storage is small and battery life even worse." She prefers the Chinese-made Oppo phone she has been using for four years. (She earns 18,000 rupees per month at her job.)
Apple's formidable ecosystem is bound to spread more slowly in a place where the iPhone remains out of reach for so many. Kunal Dua, who runs a pharmaceutical business, recently converted his wife, Gagan Deep Kaur, to the iPhone -- but only halfway. She uses it for her Instagram account and other parts of her online social life, but she stays on her Android for work.
"Most people working under us come from lower-income groups and cannot afford an iPhone," Mr. Dua said. "So sharing media and files becomes difficult."
The relationship between Apple and India is evolving quickly. The part that matters most may have less to do with India's consumers than with the country's growing role as a production hub.
Last week, analysts at JPMorgan Chase published a report describing how a push to move manufacturing and supply chains away from China has been underway "since late 2018, led by geopolitical issues, then a pandemic and now geopolitical issues again rearing their ugly head." They expected a sustained shift and estimated that a quarter of Apple's products will be made outside China by 2025, versus less than 5 percent today, "with Vietnam and India slated as countries of choice."
That migration of high-end manufacturing might activate another ecosystem altogether. Apple is not just any multinational company. A report from Mirae Asset Financial Group said that "given Apple's size, it is a key player that can set standards and influence policy decisions," noting that the company has catalyzed China's growth. "We see a similar trend now occurring in India, as Apple diversifies its supply chain into India and a burgeoning local tech-manufacturing ecosystem develops."
Ultimately, new factories and entire new industries will need to be built before India can generate the kind of wealth necessary for more of its 1.4 billion potential consumers to become regular Apple customers.
During the store opening on Tuesday, Mr. Cook pressed his palms together in a gesture of namaste. Later that day on Twitter, he praised Mumbai for the city's "incredible energy, creativity, and passion."
His fans in India were already delighted to see more of his company in their country. They may now hope that even more multinational executives follow his lead.

U.S. Loans $ 2 Billion
To Support Battery Effort
The Energy Department on Thursday announced a $ 2 billion loan to help a Nevada company step up production of critical components of electric vehicle batteries.
The company, Redwood Materials, plans to use the loan to expand a manufacturing campus near Reno, Nev., where it makes some of the components from new and recycled sources. The company was founded by J.B. Straubel, a former top Tesla executive, and has partnerships with Panasonic, Ford Motor, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.
After construction is complete, Redwood aims to produce enough battery materials at the Nevada campus to support production of more than one million electric vehicles a year. The loan will help to create about 3,400 construction jobs, Redwood and the Energy Department said. The company said it expected about 1,600 full-time employees to work at the campus when it was finished.
The announcement was the latest loan from the department to support domestic battery manufacturing as the Biden administration seeks to bring more of the supply chain for electric vehicles to the United States and reduce reliance on China. Last month, the department said it would lend $ 700 million to support a mining project in Nevada. In December, the department announced a $ 2.5 billion loan for Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution. NIRAJ CHOKSHI
RIDE HAILING
Lyft Blames Bad Weather
For Bleak Revenue Forecast
Lyft on Thursday forecast current-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates, blaming extremely cold weather in some of its major markets and lower prices, especially during peak hours, sending its shares down 23 percent in extended trading.
The company's outlook was in contrast to that of its larger rival, Uber, whose strong presence globally is helping it ride a boom in demand for ride-hailing services from travelers and officegoers
Lyft's bigger presence on the West Coast, a region that analysts have said was trailing the rest of the United States in return to pre-Covid demand, could be hurting its recovery compared with Uber's.
Lyft forecast first-quarter revenue of about $ 975 million, which fell below analyst estimates of $ 1.09 billion, according to Refinitiv data. REUTERS
FAST FOOD
Chick-fil-A Will Test
Plant-Based Sandwich
Chick-fil-A said Thursday that it's testing its first plant-based entrée -- a breaded cauliflower sandwich -- at restaurants in Denver; Charleston, S.C.; and the Greensboro, N.C., area. The test begins Monday.
The Atlanta-based company said its culinary team spent four years developing the sandwich after guests told the chain they wanted to add more vegetables to their diets. Chick-fil-A tested mushrooms, chickpeas and chopped vegetables formed into patties but kept returning to cauliflower for its mild flavor.
Like Chick-fil-A's signature chicken sandwich, the cauliflower steak is marinated, breaded, pressure-cooked and then served on a bun with two pickle slices.
Chick-fil-A is a relative latecomer to the plant-based fast food scene. Burger King started selling its Impossible Whopper -- featuring a plant-based burger made by Impossible Foods -- in 2019. Starbucks launched an Impossible sausage sandwich in 2020. McDonald's debuted its McPlant burger -- developed with Beyond Meat -- in the United Kingdom in 2021. And KFC began selling Beyond Meat nuggets last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS
